<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve small moments intensifies credibly through ritual choices; embodied "haunted euphoria" layers joy and sorrow without labels dominating. Internal conflict emerges in bittersweet triumph over fading memories. Minor repetition of traits like "gently thorough" doesn't erode closure's earned renewal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory memories and ink ritual builds to Charged Poise closure where locket pulses light, saving jetty from forgetting with legible bittersweet cost. Orientation anchored early on blooming jetty. One tightening via surfaced grandmother's rescue suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (jasmine glow, salt air, gull cries) filters through archivist's priorities, constraining ritual on jetty. Setting charges final image of eternal bloom. No white-room; purposeful selection mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate covenant vs. demolition) signaled early; accumulative deepening via steeping and writing narrows options, forcing endurance with felt cost in "haunted euphoria." Agency in ritual forecloses forgetting. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience in small moments emerges organically from proximate causes and ritual, resonating in final jetty sigh and locket glow without moralizing. Subtext in memory ghosts invites ambiguity on time's cost. Protagonist arc ties to thematic repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in detailed preservation; voice texture poetic yet consistent. Rhythmic modulation supports ritual intensity. Repetition borders convergence but closure image stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate ending ("regenerated covenant" x4, "haunted euphoria" x4, similar declarative sentences on preservation), dulling closure propulsion; synonym churn obscures density. Figurative consistency but artifacts touch final image. Read-aloud rhythm suffers from redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist ritual and magical ink covenant transforms preservation trope via proximate causes. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; particular details like walnut ink feel inevitable.</comment>
