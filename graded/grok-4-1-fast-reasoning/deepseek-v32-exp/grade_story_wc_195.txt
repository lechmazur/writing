<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation intensifies to compel orb capture, with earned shift from withdrawal via unsnapping regrets; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak chant beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure in orb pulse ("a glowing orb... held every path not taken"), with legible cost in crumbling program and past chains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard's densest trees and shimmering air constrain path to heart and charge final sentinel image; selective sensory glow/ripple mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens texturally through pattern-tracing cadence; agency in chant/unsnap forecloses withdrawal with on-page bliss wave cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of remade potential emerges organically from particulars; orb's "every path not taken" reconfigures withdrawal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with mystical perceptual signature in "reality felt thin"; diction modulates from withdrawn to open without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motif loops ("murmured allegiance," "shivering bliss," "factually mystical" each 3x) create partial template cadence without full early teaching; some paraphrase in repeated shifts dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Puppet strings ingeniously synthesize alchemical possibility capture; transforms withdrawal trope through grounded pattern mechanics.</comment>
