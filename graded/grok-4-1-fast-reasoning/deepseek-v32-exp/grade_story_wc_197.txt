<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Consistent traits like resourcefulness drive actions, but interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses act mostly in summary; no deep micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation intensifies via the lagoon discovery, yet feels declarative without genuine flaws complicating the final dissemination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puddle map to lagoon to recording to spreading builds density toward CR closure where key lightens with voices' weight, felt cost in eternal fight. Orientation anchors early; one tightening at unraveling via reflections narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Auric lagoon under starlight glows with gold, constraining access via phone booth and charging ghostly reappearance; selective sensory details like weeping willows and dial tone integrate via action. Micro-setting (lagoon depths) mirrors internal resurgence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disseminate truths as plans unravel) signaled early; accumulative deepening via lagoon figures reappearing forces recording and quiet spread, with ongoing fight as felt cost. Pressure coheres without reversal, agency in key use, but abstract indifference lacks visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth persisting vs. indifference emerges via resurfacing figures and shared stories, resonant CR in final vow under starlight reweighting apathy to action without moralizing. Particulars like puddle map seed ambiguity in sanitized histories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward reflections and symbols; voice texture poetic yet consistent, modulating to charged poise at "key felt lighter now." No dialogue; elisions purposeful in elliptical returns to lagoon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and repetitive phrasing ("revised histories," "tyranny of indifference," "carefully resourceful") across paragraphs create template cadence, dulling propulsion; synonym churn in motifs obscures closure image. Density low with redundant stems in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puddle-reflection map guiding to auric lagoon transforms rebel trope into symbolic persistence; phone booth key as bridge to eras feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
