<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through visions and embodied fear ("fingers numb with cold and fear"), with micro-choices like rock adjustment revealing hierarchy of values; minor slip in told "pure" motivation slightly abstracts drive before pivotal pour.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from rock placement to dust ignition and CR closure ("patterns were not just in the stars, but in the eels..."); cost legible in curse lifting after fulfillment, with vision-constrained causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bluff, aurora, and frictionless air constrain choices (rocks on edge, dust hovers); recurring painted rocks charge final gathering image, filtered through pattern-obsessed POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness chaos via patterns) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven adjustment after imperfect vision under accumulative lens; visible cost in "time running out" and numb adjustment forecloses ruin path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of order-in-chaos emerges organically from sparks tracing sequences to realization ("move with it"); final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant CR with eel harmony counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (patterns in "every sliding grain of sand"); rhythmic control modulates from frantic ("cursing, he realized") to poised closure, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "poured the star dust... hovered, defying the frictionless air"); minor figurative density in aurora descriptions but pattern-consistent without muddle or loops in peak beam beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless world, precog eel-herder ritual, and math-star dust payoff feels inevitable; risk in CR twist (harmony via acceptance) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
