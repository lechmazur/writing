<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaelen's jitteriness embodies concretely in trembling hands and phantom limb absence, earning a shift to calm determination via extended encounter; contradictory impulses yield to earned realization without tidy rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pendant and aurora density layers germinate insight; on-page CR closure reconfigures routine via lighter relic and vowed purpose, with conceptual cost of absence integrated into steady hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aurora's shifting lights and ridgeway's pulsing rocks constrain the lonely path and charge final dawn fade; sensory selection (cold mist, hum) mirrors emotional layering without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of coaxing wonder tightens via pendant-extended exchange narrowing jittery tedium to germinated awe; agency in questioning relic forecloses rote delivery with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-myth fade emerges organically from stretched moment and traveler's words, resonant in final relic purpose without moralizing; counter-reading of absence as enduring cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward pendant hum and aurora; dialogue natural/subtextual ("something of great weight") advances germinating insight; rhythmic prose modulates from jitter to poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive loops on "germinate," "vibrating sympathetically," and "coax wonder" create paraphrase churn dulling density in extended explanation beats; overwriting metaphors (taffy, tapestry) verge on muddle without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pendant's sympathetic vibration synthesizing time-stretch with aurora offers fresh angle on mundane magic; transforms courier trope via myth-fade frame without hedging into generic fantasy.</comment>
