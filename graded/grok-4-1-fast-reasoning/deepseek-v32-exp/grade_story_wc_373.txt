<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation sharply particularized in sound capture desire, rooted in family relic and non-revenge drive; interiority embodied in heart pounding matching waves. Limited contradiction shown—passive observation dominates over risky micro-choices at climax overhearing. False starts reveal steadfast trait but lack visible cost until end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory build and false starts; holds to Charged Poise closure in fob capturing slap of flesh with emotional cost in "sorrowful peace." Single scene oriented by paragraph 1; one tightening as proximity risks narrow options before tide. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pier decay, lapping water, lantern glow constrain stealth choices and charge final tide-swallow image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency to drips and murmurs; POV filters via runner's wariness. Rotting pier micro-setting enables hiding crates and alcove climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust-break sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via false starts to overhearing renegotiation and hand-strike. Agency in circling persistence forecloses direct confrontation path; time pressure legibly costs security. Climax slap tightens with audible snap cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fragile trust theme emerges via pact fracture events and fob-preserved crackle, reweighting premise in final clutched relic image without moral. Subtext in hush truce tensions greed betrayal; ambiguity lingers in "sorrowful peace." No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile fob traces and wave-matched heart; voice texture modulates from hushed glide to tense hold. Murmurs natural/subtextual in clipped tension; no head-hopping or leakage. Rhythm breathes with stealth pacing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("comforting unease" x3, "steadfast" x3, false starts paraphrases) create template cadence dulling mid-build momentum. Sensory propulsion strong but overwriting in peak ("visceral snap... ice on a winter branch") risks muddle. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound-absorbing fob ingeniously transforms betrayal trope into sensory quest amid moonshine-pirate hush. False starts + relic synthesis feels organic/non-obvious; risk in magical realism paid off without retreat. Final echo capture inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
