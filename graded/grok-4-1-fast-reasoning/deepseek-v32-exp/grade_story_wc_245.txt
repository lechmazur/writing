<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker's interiority is vividly embodied through skin absorption and blood-pull, rooting grief-motivated choices in sensory traits; micro-choices like path adjustment and kneeling earn the closure's emotional endurance without unearned epiphany. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to Charged Poise closure: kneeling and tuning sorrow reconfigures grief with legible emotional cost in "structured, bearable composition." Orientation anchors early; single scene fits scope perfectly, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skin, ring, and ultrasonic vibrations function as micro-setting constraining choices and charging final earth-vibration image; sensory details selectively filter through blind POV, evolving with descent to gully. Platinum ring recurs tactilely, mirroring internal navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief navigation) signaled early, escalates via note-density increase and threshold vibration under Accumulative lens, forcing kneeling agency; one tightening suffices, but cost feels more conceptual than viscerally narrowing a live option mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-unmapped-sea emerges organically from sensory particulars, resolved in non-literal final tuning without moralizing; returning constellation-pause and melody images reweight premise. Invites lingering ambiguity on acceptance's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in skin/bone sensations; rhythmic prose modulates from droning pressure to marrow stillness under stress, teaching lyric compression early. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to tactile idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor overwriting in stacked figures like "psychic dew" and "silent symphony" risks muddle in opening beats; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds obscure closure image. Selective telling compresses effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes blind skin-absorption with ultrasonic lore into inevitable emotional stillpoint; transforms sensory tropes via grief's mapmaking frame, with constellation-pause risking bold cosmic scale without gimmick. Transformation test passes: irreplaceable sensory quest.</comment>
