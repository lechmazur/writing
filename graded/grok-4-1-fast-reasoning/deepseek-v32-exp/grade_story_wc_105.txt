<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthesia trait yields concrete interiority and embodied emotion (aurora as "discordant chimes"); motivation from personal betrayal compels micro-choices like refining absences into healing. Final shift to viewing absences as "potentials for healing" earned via observation and struggle, with cost in trembling hands. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("endings birth new beginnings") borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of absences, memories, cells builds to CR closure where insight reconfigures quest (cascade of notes, healing potentials) with legible conceptual cost in shifted worldview. Orientation anchors immediately ("sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks"). Single scene fits defaults; no ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting specifics (knee-deep silt, saltwater apples, groaning shipwrecks) constrain action (wading to forge) and charge closure (relics of failure frame peace). Sensory hierarchy via synesthesia (red/green as murmurs) mirrors internal states purposefully. Recurring aurora colors evolve, reflecting struggle to success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sound of trust breaking) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via struggle ("battered by the marvel"), insight on cascade notes, method refinement—narrowing from shatter to healing with agency in calibration/testing. Cost legible in personal memory's sharpening focus and blurring colors; charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming broken trust/absences emerges organically from particulars (microbial division, layered silences), culminating in resonant CR without moralizing: "absences, when collected, could fill the emptiest spaces." Final image reweights premise via growth from fragmentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (colors as sounds); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short sentences in struggle). Voice reflects synesthete's mind without leakage; purposeful compression in realizations fits accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but paraphrase loops on "cells divided" (thrice) and "impact of memories" (reiterated phrasing) create mild redundancy across beats, dulling momentum slightly; no closure touch. Minor overwriting in metaphors (ice cracking, crumbling echo) but coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal premise (synesthetic hearing aids for trust's sound via absences) synthesizes fresh in drowned orchard; bold risks like microbial metaphor heighten stakes organically, transforming tropes of loss/healing into inevitable CR.</comment>
