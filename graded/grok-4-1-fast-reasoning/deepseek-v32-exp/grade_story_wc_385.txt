<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to learn echoes drives consistent choices like singing and listening, culminating in earned self-echo with melancholy cost. Strength in perceptive trait enabling true/false distinction; weakness in label-speak ("richly perceptive nature") reducing embodied contradiction during revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of revelations tightening to CR closure: authenticity revelation disrupts false echoes, reweighting premise with lingering sorrow cost in final image ("knowledge brought the weight of sorrow"). Orientation anchored early; no micro-turns dilute decisiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus and starlight constrain movement and illumination pivotal beats ("starlight illuminated the serpentine corridors"); universe hum as recurring micro-setting charges final harmony. Sensory bias to sound mirrors POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn echoes, restore truth) signaled early, escalates via deepening disclosures and song-disruption under Accumulative lens, forcing renunciation of manipulated order with felt cost ("heart heavy with reed-blown melancholy"). One sufficient cadence shift coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of authentic vs. fabricated echoes emerges organically from seashell revelations and song's disruption, resonant CR in "lives truthfully echoed eternally" reweighting without moralizing. Subtext in true echoes rising avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with sound-biased perceptual signature fitting echo singer; rhythmic modulation suits melancholy but repetition dulls peaks. No dialogue; elision of backstory legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("progressive disclosure," "webs of intrigue," "reed-blown melancholy") creates paraphrase loops across beats, dulling density; template cadence in stacked descriptions ("He [action], [perception]"). Artifacts pervade final third, obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo authenticity vs. nexus manipulation transforms fantasy tropes through perceptual song-disruption; bold Accumulative lyricism risks poetic density for inevitability in self-echo CR.</comment>
