<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in seeking silence amid decay, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; endurance feels earned yet passive without micro-choices under pressure. Interiority poetic but borders on abstract summaries like "gripping reality loosely" without embodied contradiction. No pivotal flaw touches closure shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from restlessness through journey to perceptual reconfiguration at "now each step... meditation on impermanence." Orientation anchored early in library/catacombs; closure as CR with felt cost of releasing tangible world legible in final swan image. One tightening via disorienting burrow suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful: moss, hummed air, obsidian walls constrain journey and charge final image; recurring swan as micro-setting enables burrow with tactile refolding. Sensory hierarchy reflects keeper's loose grip, mirroring internal decay. Object (swan) shapes tactics, qualifying 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerative silence vs. decay clutter) signaled early, deepens via disorienting burrow narrowing to perceptual shift; agency in folding/returning forecloses escape illusion with felt cost. Escalation as textural cadence under lens, charging closure without reversal overload. No abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from decay images shifting to "symphony of quiet endings"; final river/swan reprise offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in loose grip reweights loss as transformation. Minor repetition like "crumbling peace" slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: biased noticing of "whispered light and shifting geometries" modulates rhythmically. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping, voice reflects loose reality grip under calm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose rhythmic and dense, but paraphrase loops on "decay," "silence," "untold seasons" (e.g., repeated "crumbling peace") create mild churn across reflections, docking momentum; no closure dulling. Varied syntax supports lyric flow without monotony. Minor overwriting in geometric tunnel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Origami swan portal transforms portal trope organically into perceptual key; fresh synthesis of library decay and folds feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. Minor proximity to mythic observer archetype.</comment>
