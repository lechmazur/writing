<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in loneliness and tree-witness quest compels choices; healing attribute embodied in moonlight glow during climax. Earned change as sorrow dissolves via actions. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "quantified sorrow" phrasing slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from dream maps to sextant visions of trees, culminating in CR where sorrow deconstructs into miracles ("each unit of sadness replaced"). Orientation anchored early (Elara in tower, storm). Pin clink causal trigger tightens without micro turns; cost legible in foreclosed burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower moonlight and oaks constrain via healing energy and visions through sextant lens. Sensory selective: rumble, clink, glow mirror internal shift. Final oak touch charges closure image with lived-in tactility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deconstruct sorrow) signaled early, tightens at pin clink forcing action under accumulative lens. Agency in tracing dreams/directing sextant narrows to visions; cost unmistakable as sorrow units dissolve into miracles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of mundane miracles emerges organically from dream fragments and tree visions, reweighting sorrow without statement. Final image of oak touch offers non-literal resonance to witnessing motif. No moralizing; ambiguity in pin's lingering meaning lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in mapping/calculating lens (e.g., "dreams were maps of emotions"). Prose rhythm modulates to intensity at sextant glow; diction purposeful, lyrical without drift. No dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but paraphrase loops on "quantified sorrow" (three repeats) and dream motifs dull mid-beats (−0.6). Rhythm varies; no filter stacks or template cadence. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant as dream-tree bridge transforms tropes into organic quest. Risk in mystical mechanics pays off at visions; non-obvious CR feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
