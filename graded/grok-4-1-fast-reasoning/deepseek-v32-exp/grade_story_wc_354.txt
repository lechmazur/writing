<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Characterization excels in precise interiority and embodied worry stone as anxiety record, with contradictory hopeful melancholy driving the final press; flaw in alternating summary of internal conflict rather than simultaneous impulses weakens peak agency at stone-pressing climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page CR closure (covenant stirs with arduous cost felt in visions and heartbeat sync); orientation anchors early; tightening via stone-ridge fit delivers legible before/after without slips touching ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nexus pulses constrain choice by surging energy and ridge-fit, charging final image; twilight evolution mirrors internal shift; sensory selection (humming air, bending light, throbbing intensity) purposeful and POV-filtered through chess-precision lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore covenant before phase) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via visions narrowing to reconciliation trade-off; agency in deliberate stone-press forecloses exile path with felt cost in "hard path toward light"; no live option closure elevates but minor abstractness in phase pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-difficult emerges organically via silence-translation and chess metaphors, resonant non-literal answer in final stirring without moralizing; returning stone recharges prior loss; complexity in stubborn belief amid sorrow lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (translating silence, precise correlations) modulates rhythm under building intensity; diction controlled, poetic texture purposeful; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but paraphrase loops on "correlate" (three instances) and worry stone reiterations dull mid-section momentum without pattern payoff; closure image clean of artifacts; minor overwriting in visions flood.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess tutor exile, silence-translation, and magnetic covenant mechanics transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative closure pays off with inevitable stone-ridge fit hindsight.</comment>
