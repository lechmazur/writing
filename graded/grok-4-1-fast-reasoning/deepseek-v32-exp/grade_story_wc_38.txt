<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to encrypt vulnerability as strength is embodied in her dance-decoding micro-choices, earning the closure realization without unearned epiphanies. Interiority concrete via swaying gestures mapping ciphers. Minor diagnostic repetition ("encrypt vulnerability as strength") borders label-speak but ties to pivotal dance beats without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via decoding layers and intensifying dance to CR closure (vulnerability as asset, lab as recalled dream) with emotional cost legible in "heart unburdened." One tightening at master journal suffices. Orientation anchored early (Elara descending sunken lab).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Algae-streaked walls and crushing water pressure constrain defiance, mirroring internal stake; green light filters evolve to stasis reveal charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (cold quiet, resonant hum) purposeful. Body/tool (dance, dice) as micro-setting enables choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate via code, self from vulnerability) signaled early; accumulative escalation via dance intensification and dice rolls narrows options to master entry, forcing trade-off in personal encryption. Agency in patient decoding; cost felt in woven fears solidifying power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-to-strength emerges organically via dance/web motifs shifting to closure CR, non-literal in "key that could not be forged by others." Repetition of "encrypt vulnerability as strength" thrice echoes thesis, reducing subtlety (−0.5); no moralizing in peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in code-as-music/dance bias. Prose texture modulates with intensity (swaying to pirouette). No dialogue; rhythmic control fits accumulative cadence to charged poise ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density (dance poetry, web strands) in every decoding beat lacks pattern payoff, muddling clarity (−0.7); verbatim loops ("encrypt vulnerability as strength" x3, "spider spins its web" x2, "mysterious familiarity" x2) dull closure image (−0.8). Template cadence in repetitive "She [felt/danced]..."; propulsion suffers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dance-decoding ciphers with hangman's dice transforms code-breaker trope; vulnerability encryption via web motif risks lyrical boldness, inevitable in closure without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
