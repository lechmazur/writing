<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation through heat-mapping choices that evolve from observation to interpretation, culminating in weightless enlightenment; fossil handling reveals character under pressure. Minor epiphanic summary in "I was now the voice" borders unearned but anchored by prior micro-choices. Single-POV interiority particular and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mapping to fossil float (inciting) to visions and self-float (climax), delivering Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of bridged worlds. Orientation anchored early in caves/post-hibernation. One tightening via revealed paths suffices; fossil settling reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cave network and fossil constrain choices (paths revealed, float guided) and charge final image (fossil settles, maps glow). Sensory details (saline drafts, pulsing walls, golden light) selective via POV urgency, mirroring emotional transitions. Micro-setting (fossil warmth) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice unknown) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via heat-map responses (float, glow, visions) narrowing to self-elevation; agency in persistent mapping forces trade-off of observer role. Cost felt in "elevated to higher understanding." One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically from fossil/emotions tapestry, reweighted in final clarity without statement; grief/resilience subtext layers via visions. Resonant non-literal close in returning fossil avoids moralizing. Particulars (elm imprint) drive resonance over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via heat-map idiom ("swirling heat patterns," "symphony of heat signatures"); rhythmic modulation builds to weightless poise. Stable first-person focalization; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("floating" reprise, "glowing" variants) and repetitive "transitional object" phrasing dull peak beats (−0.8 non-closure cap). Rhythm varies; syntax propels accumulatively. Fossil pulse line clean exemplar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation mapper + factually mystical caves transforms silence trope via heat-emotion mechanics. Risky lyric escalation (self-float) heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; fossil reprise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
