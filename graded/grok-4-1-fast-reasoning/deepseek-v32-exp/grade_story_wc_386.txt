<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in salvaging purity via dreams, rooted in Kaelen's traits as ghost whisperer. Interiority poetic but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; micro-choices feel summarized rather than pressured. Final visit to Anya shows credible endurance with emotional cost, but no raw internal conflict peaks there.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mosaic shards (shrine, travels/dreams, Anya visit, return) taught early by intro pattern, transitions legible via "back in the glacial shrine." Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream fragments build density to CR closure when globe placed on altar, reweighting ruin to connection with felt ongoing cost of future wrecks. Orientation anchored early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and ice walls vividly selective, mirroring internal states via "frozen constellations" and "eons of silence" that charge final altar image. Sensory hierarchy fits Kaelen's perceptual bias toward whispers/starlight; setting guides choices by thinning "windows of connection." Micro-setting (melted globe) constrains revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to expose Elias's pure act signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dream density narrowing to globe's truth. Anya visit forces stance crystallization with relational cost (her tears); agency in weaving/tracing dreams forecloses forgetfulness path. Escalation coherent under lens, cost legible in spirit's calm vs. endless wrecks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from oblivion emerges organically from dream fragments and globe's shift from loss to testament. Subtext in "borrowed starlight" recurs to recharge end image without moralizing. Final altar placement offers non-literal resonance, reweighting wreckage with ambiguity of ongoing whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable with perceptual signature in starry/icy diction, modulating rhythm from reflective to charged poise at Anya's tears. Voice distinct, syntax varies purposefully for lyric texture; no head-hopping. Brief Anya interaction implies natural subtext without on-page dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence ("borrowed starlight," "weaves truth") taught early, propels via image over scaffold. Minor paraphrase loops ("weaves truth carefully" x2, "windows of connection") dull momentum slightly but don't touch closure. Rhythm varies read-aloud; figurative coherent without muddle in peak Anya beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving + dream analysis transforms ghost story into accumulative purity salvage. Risky mosaic/lyric frame heightens stakes via thin "windows," inevitable in hindsight at globe's altar reprise. No derivative templates; bold supernatural idiom feels authentic.</comment>
