<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Claustrophobia yields to agoraphobia during ascent, showing contradictory impulses; final endurance with vial as shield earns bunker repricing with felt cost of exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density builds to gilded hush CR; orientation anchored early in bunker; vial capture and descent image deliver on-page cost via limited exposure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Trellis lattice and inverted sky constrain ascent tactics and charge vial/flower final image; porcelain doll recurs tactilely from start, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silence collection stake tightens via agoraphobic ascent reversal under Accumulative lens; agency in unclipping vial forecloses prolonged trellis stay with exposure cost legible in descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silence flavors motif shifts from bunker absence to trellis presence, offering resonant non-literal answer in vial's glow reweighting contracted space without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in silence categorization; rhythmic modulation peaks in "gilded hush" hush as tangible presence, eliding without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition of "silence" builds texture; minor overwriting in "intangibly tangible" reprise slightly muddles peak trellis beat but propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Gravity inversion and silence flavors synthesize fresh xenial trellis quest; risk in surreal ascent heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via doll's gleam.</comment>
