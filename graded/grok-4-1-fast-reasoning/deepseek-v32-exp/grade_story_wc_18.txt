<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in craft and dream-vision compels ritual choices; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the breathing climax, reducing embodied depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to resonant reconfiguration—dream captured in mirror with fragile cost legible in "illusion made manifest" lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirrors and fog constrain ritual positioning and reflections, charging the glass mountains' final image; sensory selectivity reflects Elian's grounded craft bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture dream tightens accumulatively via breaths manifesting vision; one deepening narrows to anchoring with felt fragility cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of thin veils emerges through shifting glass imagery; final mirror reconfigures boundaries non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature tied to mirror-making; rhythmic prose modulates ethereal pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Propulsive density with varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops around "shimmer" and "boundaries" in ritual beats dull high-pressure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant, mirrors, and breathing transforms dream-capture trope organically; glass mountains' fragile logic feels inevitable.</comment>
