<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to break cycles intensifies through marker-following and squatter dissuasion, earning fragile freedom with felt cost of acceptance. Contradictory draw to past acts in scene via pilgrimage. Interiority concrete via embodied calm under reflective pressure; squatter adds secondary crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of markers, backstory, confrontation builds to CR closure ("fragile freedom... unmarked and unknown") with conceptual cost of carried past legible in final money spread and exit. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via squatter encounter narrows to personal realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Train setting constrains via territorial markers enabling dissuasion and charges final image as "tomb, not a home." Sensory details (dust stirred, animal smells, light through boards) filter through Leo's perceptive bias, mirroring decay of cycles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break circling paths) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via squatter pressure forcing marker-use and renunciation, foreclosing doomed path with on-page cost of isolation for realization. Agency in calm dissuasion drives escalation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable past cycles emerges organically from markers, money, startup parallel; final unmarked path reconfigures without moralizing, resonant via money reprise. Complexity in flawed inheritance avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of polished calm; dialogue natural/subtextual ("marks... warn others like us"), Leo's steady idiom vs. squatter's defensive. Rhythmic modulation supports reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but patterned repetition ("polished calm," "perceptively calm") creates minor loop without full payoff, slightly dulling peak realization beat. Varied rhythm passes ear test; no heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber inheritance via circus-train markers paralleling startup fraud transforms cycle trope; markers' robber-language ingenuity drives dissuasion uniquely, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
