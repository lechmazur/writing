<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's guarded nature and gift for finding lost things motivate consistent micro-choices like chanting and pressing the seed, culminating in her emotional unburdening with felt cost. Interiority feels concrete in embodied details like "heart beat in time with the expanding circles," but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final personal change ("guardedness unbend") is earned by prior search causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through widening circles from vortex to roots, leading to on-page CR closure with revelation ("Morwen") and reconfiguration (vortex slows, guardedness lifts). Cost legible in seed crumbling and emotional weight lifting at "some lost things are meant to be found." Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "scent of ozone and rotting fruit" and "brittle, flesh-eating plant seeds" filter through druidic POV, constraining search (crunching seeds, wedged roots). Recurring vortex and seed charge final image dissipation. "Warlike serenity" tensions growth/decay, mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbend confession for truth) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening: circles reveal secrets, seed merge gambles with "dangerous" hunger/vortex energy. Agency in chant and press forecloses rigidity with visible cost (seed sated, crumbles). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths (mirrors vs. depths) emerges organically from failed trick, search, and "confession spilled forth," reweighting guarded silence without statement. Final image ("tranquil grove where new growth could begin") offers non-literal resonance on betrayal's cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in healing lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with druidic perceptual signature ("druidic senses attuned to every ripple"). Distinct poetic texture in syntax/rhythm modulates intensity, e.g., short chants amid whirling. No dialogue; purposeful compression in ritual beats stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but "expanding circles" loops thrice (search, magic, pulse) create minor paraphrase redundancy, dulling mid-beat momentum. Figurative density ("gnarled roots that twisted into agonized shapes") borders overwriting in climax without harm to closure image. Rhythms vary read-aloud; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druid ritual with "unbend" confession via devouring seed transforms tropes; mirrors' truth angle feels non-obvious. Risk in merging hunger/vortex pays off at dissipation without gimmick. Irreplaceable particulars like "flesh-eating plant seed" anchor originality.</comment>
