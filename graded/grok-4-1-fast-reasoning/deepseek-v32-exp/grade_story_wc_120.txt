<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in chronological homesickness compels mapping and conducting with embodied urgency ("eyelids grew heavy"), but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during peak conducting; earned resolution via accumulated memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density builds to Charged Poise closure ("Elara lowered the shell, her task complete as fatigue set in"), with legible cost in exhaustion and dissolved homesickness; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell constrain choices (spire amplifies light, lake cracks add bass, shell guides memories) and charge final image; sensory details selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphony before exhaustion) signaled early, escalates via accumulating memory density under Accumulative lens, narrowing options with urgency; protagonist agency in mapping/conducting forecloses path with felt fatigue cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming lost time through silent music emerges organically from memory mapping and conducting; final image ("Chronologically homesick no more, she had found home in the music") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synaesthetic perceptual signature ("transposed that melody into a visual pattern") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates with intensity, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in memory beats; minor paraphrase loops ("memory" recurrences) and heavy figurative layering in peak ("invisible storm") dull propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-cookie prophecies as symphony notes, memory-mapping via nautilus, and silent conducting transforms tropes into bold, inevitable arc; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
