<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to resolve static rooted in nostalgic traits drives precise actions like miniaturization; internal conflict between chaos and containment embodied in static buzz and fear-core creation. Final escape earned with cost of integrated fears. Minor abstract epiphanies ("fragmented wholeness") slightly dilute embodiment in reflective close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of static, fears, and organic motifs to Charged Poise closure: Kael steps into desert, static fades, carrying condensed fears as conceptual cost legible in "pieces of his past both lost and integrated." Orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dome's hum, thorny blooms, and wavering fields constrain breach choice at climax; roses' "petals holding awareness" mirror android's organic pull. Final desert as "living skin" recharges motif. Sensory hierarchy android-specific (static vs. warmth).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence static) signaled early, tightens via miniaturization into fear-core catalyzing burn under accumulative lens; ignition forecloses dome stasis with cost of internalized fears. Agency in preparation and activation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of containing chaos for freedom emerges via fear miniaturization and escape; final image ("mosaic of android and experience") offers resonant CR repricing nostalgia as "light burden" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature fusing mechanical (static) and organic (yielding skin); rhythmic prose modulates from buzz to "peaceful silence." Experimental fragment echoes taught early, legible at close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in ending ("contained the chaos," "fragmented wholeness" echoed 3x) dull closure density; "strangely organic" motif repeats without tightening payoff. Propulsion strong otherwise, no filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia, crystallized fears as burn catalyst, and magnetic shift transforms sci-fi tropes; risk of organic-machine fusion heightens stakes organically to escape's reconfiguration.</comment>
