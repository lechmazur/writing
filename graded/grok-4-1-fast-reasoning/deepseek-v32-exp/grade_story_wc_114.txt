<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in studying the insect amid swirling doubts, embodied in unsteady legs and throat stone; final pinning earns change with cost of embraced futility. Minor abstract phrasing like "swallowed truth" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to CR closure ("pinned...with a new smudge that marked her acceptance"); cost legible in reweighted certainties. Orientation anchored first line; one tightening at console correlations suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Illustration as recurring object constrains choices (unpinning, comparing) and charges final image; auroral light and microclimate mirror internal margins without overt symbolism. Sensory selectivity fits post-fever urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront futility) signaled early, tightens at insect discovery narrowing avoidance options; agency in smudging screen forecloses denial with acceptance cost. Accumulative cadence reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection's beauty emerges organically from illustration's evolution and final smudge; resonant non-literal answer in pinning reprise reweights certainties without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature blending data/intuition; rhythmic modulation peaks in "stone in her throat," purposeful compression taught early pays at closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates motif recurrence (margins, smudge) purposefully; rhythm varies without loops, though minor paraphrase in "swaying certainties" echoes slightly dulls peak. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle epiphany via illustration and microclimate transforms introspection trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes through irreplaceable margins conceit.</comment>
