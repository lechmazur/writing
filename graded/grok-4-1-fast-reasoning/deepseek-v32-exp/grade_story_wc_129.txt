<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to belong is embodied in the "luminescent ache" and actions like leaving sculptures and guiding the search; internal fear/hope at joining shows contradiction. Final change earned via perseverance, with cost of prior isolation legible. Minor slip: "boldly sympathetic" reads as label before full embodiment in risks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as search builds density toward tag discovery; closure as RR (ache reconfigures to belonging) lands on-page at arbor with communal welcome as felt cost. One tightening via fruitless days to revelation. Orientation anchored early at crater/orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arbor as recurring micro-setting constrains climax (tag hidden there) and charges final image as gathering place. Sensory details (chiming gems, shadows) selective via Elara's sculptor eye; mirrors isolation-to-unity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through shared search's failures to discovery; agency in Elara's guidance narrows isolation options. Cost unmistakable in ache's transformation and risked rejection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kinship theme emerges organically from reed metaphors and search camaraderie; final arbor image resonantly reweights isolation premise without moralizing. Subtext in unacknowledged sculptures resolving via communal embrace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (light/shadow via sculptor); poetic diction modulates from ache to radiance. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("I wish to join"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors, but "webs of kinship" loops (4x) create paraphrase churn, dulling propulsion mid-search. Rhythm varies; minor overwriting in descriptive runs, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fantasy elements (reed sculptures, gem orchard) synthesize freshly into kinship metaphor; risk in poetic ache transforms tropes organically. Arbor discovery feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
