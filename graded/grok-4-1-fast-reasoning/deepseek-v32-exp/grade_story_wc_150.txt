<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to restore faith drives consistent micro-choices like excavating and rebuilding, with embodied curiosity in "patiently curious hands." Interiority concrete but slips into repetitive labeling of traits like "warmly curious." Final change to restored heart earned by prior discoveries without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from wandering to sundial discovery ("fingers brushed against cold, intricately carved stone") to scrolls, landing CR closure with orchard's "peace settled" reweighting journeys as cycles. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via shadow to vessel. Cost legible in reverence and honored rest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard vivid and purposeful: roots "snaking between ancient bones" constrain digging and mirror interrupted journeys, charging final "tree roots would continue to snake between bones." Sensory hierarchy fits POV urgency; tone tensions enchantment with death. No white-room; spatial coherence in shadow pointing to tree.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore faith) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing to scrolls; agency in rebuilding sundial forecloses doubt with felt reverence cost. Shadow reversal tightens options coherently under lens. Price visible in "hands trembling" and honored bones.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cycles over interruption emerges organically from particulars like sundial carvings and scrolls ("journeys that pause but never truly end"), resonant in final orchard peace without moralizing. Subtext in bones/roots interplay; invites reflection via ambiguity of eternal return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in enchanted noticing ("air held a cautious enchantment"); rhythmic modulation builds to peak. No head-hopping or withholding; voice texture poetic yet legible, modulating with intensity. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("interrupted journeys," "purposeful wandering") across paragraphs create paraphrase churn, dulling density; e.g., multiple "rebuild" echoes without variation. Rhythm varies but template cadence in excavation beats. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora quest with catacomb archaeology and sundial puzzle transforms relic-hunt trope; shadow-to-scrolls turn inevitable from carvings. Bold orchard setting heightens stakes organically; no derivative templates.</comment>
