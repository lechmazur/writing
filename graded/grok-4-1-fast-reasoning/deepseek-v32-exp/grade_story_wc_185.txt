<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to find quiet intensifies credibly through embodied sensory overload and exhaustion cost at "sank to her knees." Interiority concrete via stone's pulse matching heartbeat, but mild archetypal epiphany in final smile dilutes contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chaos density builds to hush bloom RR closure with exhaustion cost legible at kneeling moment. Orientation anchors early; single scene coheres with one tightening via conjuring peak. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cracks and stone constrain choices, charging final image where cracks "gleamed with faint luminescence." Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant narrows aptly under crisis; cave vibrations evolve causally with hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance) signaled early, escalates via density increase to agency-driven conjuring that forecloses suppression path with visible exhaustion cost. Coherent pressure under Accumulative lens; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of weaving chaos into harmony emerges organically from ice-map reading and beings' softening, resonant in final "silent poetry" image reweighting premise without moral. Complexity lingers in new stable pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in vibrational noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from storm to hush without slippage. Voice texture distinct via luminous/ripple diction, apt for lyric fantasy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive "gently luminous" and hush/paraphrase loops (e.g., tranquility spreading variants) create −0.8 artifact drag, dulling peak density. Strong rhythmic propulsion otherwise, but overwriting muddles conjuring beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vibe-entities and ice-crack maps transforms harmony trope; risk in accumulative hush bloom feels organic, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
