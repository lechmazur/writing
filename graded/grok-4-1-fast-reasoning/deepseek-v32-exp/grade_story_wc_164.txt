<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like transliterating his own determination to stabilize patterns; earned shift from conjecture to certainty with visible cost in cheerful gloom. Contradictory impulses act in scene via joy/sorrow mix.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via visions/seeds/glass to CR closure ("disappearance is not an end, but a transformation") with legible conceptual cost in inevitable loss. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via coalescing pieces suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Iridescent cave/crystals/seeds constrain choices (tap echoes, amplify efforts) and charge final image (walls brighten, hum with approval). Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency; mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early (why paths disappear); meaningful deepening via emotional visions narrows to realization, driven by agency in conjecturing/transliterating. Cost unmistakable in pang of cheerful gloom foreclosing tidy permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (sacrificed emotions erase paths); final constellation image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting premise via transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (memories as foam/light/scent); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, poetic diction purposeful for fantasy voice. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("conjectured" x4, "cheerful gloom" x4) slightly dull mid-beats without full pattern payoff; no artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-gathering fantasy via glass/seeds/bird transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in abstract conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via particulars.</comment>
