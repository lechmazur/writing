<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in finding story origins compels incising journey with consistent traits, but interiority drifts to abstract epiphanies like "profound connection, her own fragments integrating" without strong embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns of absence and incising accumulate to CR closure in evolved realization ("lull not as failure but as potential") with legible cost in spent vial; orientation anchored early, one tightening via doorway formation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard and cloud-wood constrain choices (tracing circle on glass floor) and charge final image (library responds, trembles); surreal sensory details selectively mirror voids and integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of accessing story origins signaled early amid lull pressure; accumulative deepening via quantified absence narrows options to vial use, agency in incising forces trade-off with moonlight depletion visible on return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of absence birthing stories emerges organically from particulars like empty shelves and seedling narratives, resonant CR in "fragmentation could lead to wholeness" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of scattered intuition; rhythmic poetic diction modulates purposefully, perceptual bias filters surreal details character-specifically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but final third paraphrase loops ("quantified the absence," "glimmering parole," repeated realizations) dull closure image, applying −0.6 for patterned redundancy touching end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of erasure-to-inspiration via moonlight incision feels inevitable from fragmented motifs; bold lyric risk heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
