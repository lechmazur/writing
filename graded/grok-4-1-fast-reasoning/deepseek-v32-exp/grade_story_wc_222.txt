<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in climb and ritual, but traits like "sacredly playful grace" lean labeled over embodied contradiction during swap jolt; no deep internal conflict complicates pivotal exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: climb leads to swap therefore lid placement triggers DC in sky mending with jolt cost legible; orientation anchored early in spire and Unweaving; lens stable to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice spire and wrong sky constrain climb and charge final glow/hum; sensory vivid via windswept air, cracking voice; details integrate into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to amend sky tightens at incomplete ritual via guardian gesture; agency in swap/placement forecloses wrong sky with jolt/embrace cost; causal lens escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's joyful repair emerges via playful climb to cosmic mending image; final descent with queen reweights thief's role without moralizing; subtext in ritual mischief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward wonder; voice distinct in poetic rhythm, dialogue sparse but echoing ("sky is wrong"); minor elevated diction fits fantasy idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops; minor repetition of "embracing unknown" motif pays off at arms-open climax without dulling propulsion; figurative integrated purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess ritual and sundial to mend sky transforms thief trope; risk in cosmic stakes via chivalrous play feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
