<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's scheming shown via subtle urges, but Kael's pivotal tears and softening lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, relying on summary epiphany; therapy-speak like "clinging to a sinking stone" undermines embodiment in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via shifts and vibrations to RR closure; sanctuary anchors orientation early; cost legible in "tears welled" and resentment dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cylinder as micro-setting constrains conviction and charges final wholeness image; sanctuary's non-light/shifts mirror internal grace purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake of resentment release signaled early, tightens texturally via wall-dissolve memory; agency in Elara's projections forces Kael's cascade with tears as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cylinder motif shifts from broken to whole for resonant repricing of innocence over bitterness; late "Let it go" whisper borders thematic echo, reducing subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature in shifting metaphors; sparse mental dialogue carries subtext and advances without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive "cellular memory" (4x) and "shifting grace" (3x) loops create template cadence across peak memory cascade; some paraphrase on resentment dulls density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Reappearing pin triggering cellular memory transforms forgiveness trope organically; fresh synthesis of soundless void and primal recall feels inevitable at cylinder's silent tune.</comment>
