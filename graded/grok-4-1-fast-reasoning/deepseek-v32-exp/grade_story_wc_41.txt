<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Precognitively forgetful trait consistently constrains micro-choices like driftwood placement guided by vanishing visions, earning the final realization as Earned Stasis; embodied tidal longing layers contradiction between pursuit and erosion without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup of seeking-forgetting cycles to CR closure ("to capture the sound was to lose its essence"), with legible cost in chalk snap and purpose evaporation; orientation anchors firmly in opening lines, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog sculptures and driftwood constrain navigation choices throughout, charging final image where markers reframe journey; videotape hush amplifies echo stakes tactilely, POV-filtered through prophetic haze without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture aging sound tightens via cadence shift—chalk stub to snap—narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in markers and sketches shows endurance with felt cost in forgetting, charging throne poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of echoes in impermanence emerges organically from particulars like smudged chalk and fading visions, resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing; final throne acceptance offers non-literal answer to longing's rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of mist-dissolving images; rhythm modulates tension purposefully, diction biased toward auditory ghosts without register drift or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on forgetting ("vision dissolved," "forgot...lapse," "evaporated") and template cadence ("He arranged," "He clung," "He heard") dull mid-section density (-1.1); strong propulsion recovers at closure image, no artifact harm there.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophetic forgetting in fog-junkyard seeking sound of age transforms tropes boldly; risk in lyric accumulation heightens inevitability of CR without gimmickry obscuring clarity.</comment>
