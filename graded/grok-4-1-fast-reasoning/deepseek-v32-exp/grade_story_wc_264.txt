<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to cultivate sparks is consistent and intensifies via draining hollowness, compelling persistence; dreamless nature enables unswayed work. Weakness in lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—persistence reads too frictionless, no internal hierarchy revealed in micro-choices like "she persisted" amid resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from single spark to multiple sites and collective brightening, tightening to RR/Charged Poise closure where "sparks ignited into steady flames" reconfigures her state with legible draining cost. Orientation anchored early on dune; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glowing dune pulses and breathes, mirroring/changing with her efforts ("light intensifying as if feeding on the hope") to charge final image. Sensory selective (warm sand, humming air, pulsing flowers) filters through her quantum-biased perception; constrains by anchoring her physical amid diffused state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate sparks) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via draining multi-site tending ("each effort drained her") narrowing to collective ignition; agency in intent-weaving forecloses hollow isolation with felt hollowness cost. One decisive deepening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of dreamless renewal emerges organically from spark-charming amid desolation, reweighted in final "welcomed them [dreams]" image without moralizing. Sparks/archive particulars avoid platitudes; ambiguity in timeless vigil lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: quantum diffusion ("slipping between probabilities"), lyric texture modulates from fractured to smoothing. Purposeful poetic compression legible, no head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens diffusion beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in repetitive charming beats ("reached for one such spark... charmed it too") dull propulsion slightly (−0.4), but rhythm varies, density high, metaphors coherent (light/shadow without muddle). No filter stacks or template cadence; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh quantum-archive synthesis transforms post-apocalypse tropes via dreamless diffusion and spark-probability weaving; chess clock/dune reprise feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committed to premise.</comment>
