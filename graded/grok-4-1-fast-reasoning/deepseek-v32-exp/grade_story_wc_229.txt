<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in belief about whispers vs shouts, embodied in vial handling and stair meditation; interiority concrete via scent memory and heart-pull echo. Minor flaw: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making arc feel harmonious without struggle. Final endurance of faith earns closure without deeper cost visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent/intention density builds to cadence shift at vibration echo/return ("soft echo that brought tears"). Closure as Charged Poise legible with emotional cost in tears/cork cooling. Single scene anchors early; brief brother shard fits mosaic exception without breaking drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (night jasmine, damp soil, blue haze) selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states via garden memory. Lighthouse constrains climb/ledge placement; recurring cobalt hue charges final image as "beacon not of light, but of hope." Environment shapes ritual tactics perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (call brother/prove whispers) signaled early, escalates via intention purification/density under Accumulative lens to narrowing of doubt at echo return. Agency in ritual forecloses forceful alternatives with felt emotional cost (year's wait, tears). One tightening sufficient; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of quiet persistence emerges organically from ritual/scent waves vs shouts; final garden closure ("flowers closed their blooms") reweights premise non-literally with resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity in mystical success invites reflection. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with perceptual bias (scent as memory/vibration); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with intensity (short sentences in infusion). No dialogue; voice texture distinct in poetic phrasing like "screaming tenderness." Brief brother glimpse purposeful, not head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cork... warmed and hummed"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in repeated "vibrations/purifying" phrasing purposeful for pattern, not artifact. Closure image clear, no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-magic/vibrations transforms lost-at-sea trope via garden essence and intent purification; risk in mystical non-confrontation heightens quiet stakes. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early premise. Bold tonal poise elevates.</comment>
