<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chaplain's guilt rooted in parole failure compels learning choice with embodied thudding heart; contradictory remorse and hope act simultaneously, earning renewed spirit at closure without epiphanic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via repair density from skepticism to tick; on-page closure DC/RR in chime reconfigures purpose with cost of past inaction legible in "contrition" pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shop's oil-wood air and light shards constrain repair tactics, mirroring internal shift; dust motes as "shards of hope" charge final golden spill without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake deepens via "patience not force" reversal, narrowing to hands-on learning; agency forecloses despair with felt time/effort cost charging tick image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parallel broken heart/chaplain emerges implicitly, chime non-literally answering second chances; reweights regret-action tension without tidy moral or echo statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sacred-perceptual signature ("penitent rhythm"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, modulating with repair intensity sans head-hopping.</comment>
