<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in retrocognition compels alignment choices; interiority concrete via visions and "thistle-blown hope"; earned change in ignited belief with contradictory doubt acting in climax hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to Vega zenith; on-page Charged Poise closure ("pinprick...burst") reconfigures meaning after "long moment" cost; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pavilion's humming ribs and stone table constrain prism alignment; sensory hum evolves to "harmonizing" with beam, charging final image; selective details mirror internal hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle/prove meaning) signaled early; accumulative escalation via vision-guided tightening narrows to final slot with legible doubt cost before beam.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of meaningful coincidences emerges from prism visions and beam success; final image non-literally answers via "universe whispering," reweighting hush without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in fragmented visions and hope metaphors; rhythmic poetic diction modulates from delicate to radiant without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm supports propulsion, but metaphor density peaks ("dandelion clock," "thistle-blown") borders overwriting without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh retrocognition synthesis transforms post-collapse trope; prism/star alignment turn feels inevitable from visions, risking bold hope against hush.</comment>
