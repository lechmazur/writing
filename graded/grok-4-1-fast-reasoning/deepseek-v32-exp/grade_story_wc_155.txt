<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rediscover joy drives concrete micro-choices like applying algae, with embodied emotion in "chilled and stiff" fingers and bittersweet laugh. Internal conflict emerges in recognizing joy's fleeting nature against fog's return. Minor flaw: initial traits feel slightly labeled before shown in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragment discovery to holographic projection, yielding Charged Poise closure in "fog... less like a prison and more like a canvas" with felt cost of impermanence. Orientation anchored early in orchard district. Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog and ruined walls constrain choices (damp walls dislodge fragment) and charge final image (fog as canvas). Sensory details selective via POV (luminescence/shadow). Micro-setting of skeletal tree and wall mirror internal reclamation, evolving with light display.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragment → light-weaving → phantom orchard tightening options. Agency in display action forecloses escape fantasy with cost of fading images. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming joy emerges organically from light vs. fog contrast, resonating in final image without statement. Subtext in "exposed film" shifts meaning from loss to latent potential. Complexity lingers in bittersweet balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (paints "with light," sees in luminescence). Voice texture rhythmic, modulating from muted gray to pulsing life. No head-hopping; compression purposeful in vision sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies effectively. Minor paraphrase loops in fog/joy repetition ("lost joy," "rediscover that lost joy") dull some beats but purposeful under textural lens. No closure artifacts; strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of holographic memory via algae/prism transforms mural artist trope into light-painting ingenuity. Risky Accumulative design pays off in CR closure. Non-obvious "knowledge network" infuses originality without gimmick.</comment>
