<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in curiosity drives resurrection choices consistently, with micro-choices like mapping tunnels revealing traits under decay's pressure. Interiority concrete via tactile railing trace and sextant weight, but label-speak like "stoic wonder" and "functionally creative" slightly abstracts embodiment. Final realization earns change via prior actions, foreclosing mere repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries (sextant, tunnels) builds to CR closure in leaving sextant as beacon, reweighting decay with conceptual adaptation cost legible in "forged a new path forward." Orientation anchored early in spaceport details; single arc with time compression fits scope. No debt, pattern taught implicitly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dust motes in cracked domes, cold railing) filter through engineer's bias, constraining choices via conduits and tunnels that enable resurrection. Setting evolves causally (light floods atrium, garden sprouts), mirroring internal renewal without overt symbolism. Maze constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect for hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening layers (kiosk find to hydroponics), narrowing to adaptation trade-off with felt cost in "not reversed time." Agency in rerouting shows one tightening; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from particulars like dry aqueducts to sprouting garden, reweighted in final equations/image without moralizing. Subtext in maze decoding invites reflection on hope's dynamism; counter-reading (systemic failure) lingers. Sextant reprise charges CR non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (engineer notes structural redundancies, constellations); voice modulates rhythmically from inspection to calm satisfaction. Prose texture distinct in syntax variety, perceptual bias in "maze of intentions." No dialogue; elision of days purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers traced... maze of intentions" advances setting/character); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("stoic wonder," "maze of intentions" repeats) and occasional overwriting in atrium flood deduct, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civil engineer repurposes spaceport post-carnival into sanctuary via sextant calibration transforms abandonment trope organically. Risk in sci-fi hydroponics renewal heightens stakes; final pedestal image inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
