<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via glyph analogies to magnetic fields reveals character-particular thinking; final transformation from haunted to purified ambitions feels earned through embodied pacing and whispers. Minor flaw: "kindly methodical" feels slightly label-like without deeper tradeoff visibility until late.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from seed placement to glow, visions, and CR closure in arbor's sigh and cloud swirls, with conceptual cost of ignorance closed legible on page. Orientation anchored immediately; single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor vividly constrains choices—seed niche, field adjustments, lattice reestablishment—and charges final image of aligning stones. Sensory details (thin air, humming pulses) filtered through Elian's priorities, mirroring transitions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of transition) signaled early and tightens texturally via glow intensification and visions forcing resonance realization; agency in seed use and lattice act forecloses haunted path with felt wisdom cost. Low external pressure slightly mutes visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transitions via resonance emerges organically from glyph-field analogies and river-sea fade, culminating in non-literal CR repricing ambitions without moralizing. Final cloud swirls recharge particulars with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in cuneiform-filtered observations; rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise. No head-hopping or leakage; purposeful poetic compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax mirroring insight buildup; no major loops, but minor paraphrase echoes ("analogical thinking," "haunted ambitions") in mid-beats dull one transition slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform mysticism and magnetic physics transforms tropes into inevitable resonance realization; bold arbor setting heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
