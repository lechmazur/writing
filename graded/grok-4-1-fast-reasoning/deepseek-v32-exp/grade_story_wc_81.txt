<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority via tactile micro-choices like stamping margins and probing drawer reveal contradictory impulses (doubt vs resolve); earned change at scroll discovery forecloses neat indexing with felt cost of messy truth. Minor label-speak ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive") slightly abstracts embodiment in early beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed indexing to hypothesis-driven stamps, drawer probe, scroll find; CR closure at "stamped one of the newly found scrolls... profound reclaimed stillness" reconfigures truth with conceptual cost of rejected narrative. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via hypothesis suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stamp as micro-setting constrains choices (inkpad by memory, probe edge) and charges final image ("antique ink stamp felt lighter"); tactile sensory hierarchy (cool wood, raised symbol, paper/salt scent) reflects POV urgency in blackout. Sunken warping hints water damage enabling discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honest origins vs curated history) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via hypothesis narrowing to tactile map and cabinet probe; agency in readjustment forces trade-off, cost legible in "months stalled" broken by messy truth charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of messy truth over imposed order emerges organically from palimpsest hypothesis and scroll contradiction; final image ("emerge... with a honest, complicated story") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior indexing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tactile perceptual signature ("mind a calm lake," selective touch over sight); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed calm to charged discovery, diction biased to archival precision without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Lifting the stamp, she pressed it into a dry inkpad... tactile feedback"); varied rhythm, no major loops though "reclaimed stillness" patterns purposefully. Minor figurative density coherent, no muddle in peak drawer reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh tactile blackout mystery transforms archival trope via palimpsest hypothesis and ink stamp as anchor/tool; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight from early perceptual setup.</comment>
