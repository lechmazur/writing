<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in obsession drives lie and discoveries with intensifying stakes; interiority concrete via "sensed absence" embodiment. No strong contradictory impulses in scene limit 9+; lie reveals character under pressure but lacks deeper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomalies build density to CR closure ("they go into the silence between the notes") with conceptual cost of permanent absence. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via lie narrows options without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archive setting vivid and selective (humming servers, cool air, screens); patch as micro-setting constrains investigation and charges discoveries. Sensory hierarchy fits attentive POV; no spatial incoherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deleted files' fate) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via numbers/patch/lie to foreclose simple answer. Cost legible in "sensed absence now a permanent part"; agency in lie and preservation alters options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory's cost emerges organically from fragments and final CR image reweighting premise without moralizing. Patch/numbers shift meaning; ambiguity lingers in unsolved crime.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (digital ghosts, voids); rhythmic prose modulates from attentive sifting to resonant close. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("brightly attentive," "sensed absence") creates minor paraphrase loops dulling density in reflective beats. Rhythm varies but overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "ashes on the wind") risks coherence without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive as graveyard uncovering sabotage via digital clues transforms cold case trope. Risky poetic frame heightens conceptual stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
