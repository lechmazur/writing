<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to prove his theory compels the lever pull with consistent traits, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Dr. Aris's thaw feels earned yet surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to hologram's resolution as CR closure; cost legible in narrow Mothraal window felt through "nothing happened" suspense before payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nexus and holographic console constrain the demo choice and charge final fading image; sensory details like brass lever's coolness filter through mechanic's tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving theory tightens via lever pull and brief failure under accumulative lens, forcing endurance with window cost; agency clear in Kael's demonstration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time and thawing reserve emerges organically from hologram reveal and hand on shoulder; final image reweights perceptions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases toward mechanical details; dialogue subtextual with skepticism thawing naturally, rhythm modulates to quiet thrill.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "mechanically warm" and "hush" slightly drag without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobio station, Mothraals, and lateral time via nexus demo feels inevitable; risk-taking in subtle CR closure heightens quiet stakes organically.</comment>
