<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaelen's arc from arsonist to preserver shows contradictory impulses acting in discoveries like mending the tapestry, earning the closure change with felt cost in self-reflection; minor label-speak ("analytically intuitive") slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as art discoveries build density to CR closure in compiling the guide and emerging transformed, with undeniable conceptual cost in "preservation as the true rebellion"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via portrait-as-map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dust-laden corridors and shaft of light constrain exploration and charge the tapestry reveal; sensory details like breath misting integrate purposefully through goal-directed movement without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rescue promise tightens accumulatively through trail-following and portrait decoding, narrowing options with agency in mending; cost legible in days of work and past-fire renunciation charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final surge of volcanic tenderness reweights destruction-to-preservation theme non-literally from particulars like the curator's sacrifice; resonance emerges organically without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on fire's dual role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dissecting art symbols; voice texture modulates rhythmically from analytical to tender, consistent under pressure without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulation; purposeful "volcanic tenderness" motif avoids loops, but minor synonym churn in reflection phrases ("trail of artistic creations") dulls one peak slightly without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist redeeming via curator's art-trail map transforms trope organically; risk in "volcanic tenderness" tone heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
