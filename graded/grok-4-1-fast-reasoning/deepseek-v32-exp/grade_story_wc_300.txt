<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via tears and heart walls dissolving during pearl placement; motivation intensifies credibly from hesitation to crowning action with felt cost. Minor slip: epiphany at "motivation became clear" edges toward tidy rationalization without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shell pickup to confessions to pearl crowning, yielding RR closure in light eruption reconfiguring inspection role; cost legible in "walls he had built around his own heart began to dissolve." Orientation anchored early, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal caves vividly constrain via stalagmite "natural throne" for crowning; sensory hush, chimes, iridescence mirror internal hush-to-harmony shift. Recurring shell/pearl charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure bunkers) deepens accumulatively via acquired hopes narrowing to crowning agency; tightening at confessions forces trade-off, cost felt in personal walls dissolving. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hopes essential to survival emerges via shell particulars, resonant in final decision/image without moralizing; reweights premise as "survival was meaningless without them."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature shifting from sterile inspector to hope-conduit; rhythmic modulation heightens hush-to-light burst without head-hopping or filter excess. No dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm in light-burst paragraph; minor paraphrase loop in "resonant hush" repeats (thrice) dulls early propulsion slightly, but no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker inspector finding shell-confessions transforms doomsday trope into hope-beacon; pearl-crowning turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
