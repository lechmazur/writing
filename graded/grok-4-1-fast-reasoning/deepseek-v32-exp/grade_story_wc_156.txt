<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity solidifies through embodied actions like prying the coin and tapping the crystal, earning her final renunciation; contradictory impulses between expertise and wonder act in scene via experimental choices. Minor slip: some realizations like "nested awakenings" lean toward unearned epiphany phrasing without deeper flaw confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via layered revelations (coin → ripples → hidden faces → infinite cycle), culminating in CR closure as Elara tosses the coin, reweighting restoration premise with conceptual cost of forsaken certainty legible in "Her work was done, but her journey had just begun." Orientation anchors early; one tightening via coin-tap suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound Wave Garden vividly sensory (melodies bloom visible, hum resonates, ripples pulse light), with crystal and mural constraining choices (tapping sends ripples revealing layers) and charging final self-healing image. POV-filtered through restorer's priorities; no white-room, spatial coherence clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening revelations narrowing to full embrace; agency in playful experiments forecloses expertise path with felt cost in tossed coin and "letting certainty fall away." One tightening via coin-ripples reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wonder over certainty emerges organically from particulars (coin unlocks sonic layers, mural lives), resonant CR in final image of vanishing coin and self-healing mural reweighting without moralizing. Subtext in "pause" motif implies infinite ambiguity; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV with perceptual signature (artistic noticing of patterns, strokes); rhythmic modulation builds to peak (short sentences in revelations). Minimal dialogue natural; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but −0.8 for paraphrase loops ("nested awakenings" thrice, "methodically playful" repeat, "pause" motif redundant without variation) and figurative density bordering muddle in peak ("bewitching melody deepened... pulsing with light") dulling propulsion slightly; rhythm varies, no major scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic garden + hobo nickel key transforms restoration trope into awakening cycle; risk in surreal accrual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via coin's evolution to closure image. No derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
