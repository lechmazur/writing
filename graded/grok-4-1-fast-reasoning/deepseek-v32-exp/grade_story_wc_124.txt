<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Uncorking the vial despite aromatic caution embodies internal conflict between avoidance and curiosity, earning shift from wistful to wise with embodied grief cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory buildup (UV fluorescence, pollen glow) yields Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in "she had to grieve" syncing personal memory with plant legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse's humid aromas constrain caution, charging final "crystal shadows lengthened" image; selective sensory filter (scents over visuals) mirrors POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding tears) deepens via vial uncorking under transformation timeframe, narrowing to emotional sync with pollen; agency in lantern adjustment and vial release forecloses avoidance with grief cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of memories as sensory bridges emerges organically until final lines' explicit articulation ("fingerprints of the soul") borders Thematic Echo, diluting resonance with direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/scent biases; rhythmic prose modulates from cautious observation to awe, maintaining diction coherence under emotional peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action with motifs like "transformation completed," but minor paraphrase loops in ending summaries ("grieved...found her answer") slightly dull propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct pollen encoding memories via UV/scent transforms wistful broker trope; pollen-emotion sync feels inevitable from prior particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
