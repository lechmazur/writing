<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Logically emotional trait enables analysis amid urgency ("analyzing pitches while feeling the urgency in his bones"), but label repetition without deeper contradictory impulses acting in pivotal adjustment beat limits to strong with slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibration density builds to Charged Poise closure ("ice steadied, its movements syncing into a gentle rhythm"); cost legible in key fracture threat; single scene coherent with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains choices (thinning ice risks eruption, crunching boots echo fragility) and charges final image of serene stillness; sensory selection (ice groans, misting breath) purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect artifact) signaled early; accumulative escalation via skewing vibrations forcing stance adjustment ("poured his will into the key"); agency-driven tightening with legible cost forecloses dissonance path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Harmony of logic/emotion emerges organically from vibrational process, resonant in final fusion image; minor slip in near-moralizing close ("fusion of logic and emotion, a harmony as real as the ice") slightly undercuts subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature tuned to vibrations/sound; rhythmic prose modulates intensity effectively; cap applied due to Q7 line debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn in ending (repeated "balance restored," "harmony," "key's gentle hum," "serene order"); template cadence in stacked descriptive sentences dulls closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh sonic fantasy synthesis in drift-ice marina with vibrational matching transforms tropes organically; premise angle (engineer guards star-iron key for sound purification) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
