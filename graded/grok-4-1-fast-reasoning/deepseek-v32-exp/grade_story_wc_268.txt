<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation fiercely clear and consistent, driving persistent micro-choices like inking runes; Lorian's "titan in purpose" reply reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Minor slip: internal contradictions more asserted ("strength not in force but persistence") than dramatized simultaneously in pivotal writing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of message-planting builds to cadence shift in rune activation (DC closure with legible cost in "Theron's form wavered"). Orientation anchored early; summary jumps to scholar/Theron maintain drive without breaks, one tightening via network of doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library as micro-setting constrains tactics (hiding evidence, etching floor rune) and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (ink scent, parchment whisper) reflects Lorian's priorities. Selective details like "strata of dust" mirror decay theme without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via seeds/network to rune-deepening that forecloses Theron's options with on-page cost ("graceful collapse"). Agency in gesture tests commitment; minor abstractness in early stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth's patient unraveling emerges organically from rune/messages, resonant non-literal answer in final collapse reweighting force vs. persistence. Subtext in "all lies contain fissures" charges without moralizing; counter-reading (violence tempting?) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (epochal patience in noticing constellations); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse climax dialogue ("You are but a speck"). Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden (sneer vs. calm reply); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/atmosphere; figurative language ("ink blooming like a night flower") purposeful but borders overwriting in setup beats (−0.6). Minor paraphrase loop in "graceful collapse" echoes dulls climax edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: diminutive titan wielding library patience/rune transforms usurpation trope, inevitable hindsight via "drift" logic. Risky poetic fantasy risks purple but heightens stakes coherently without gimmick.</comment>
