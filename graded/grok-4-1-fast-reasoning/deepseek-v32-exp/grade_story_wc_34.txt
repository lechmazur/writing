<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to articulate needs drives consistent actions like tracing the bolt plate, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; embodied emotion in fingers tracing grooves shows particularity, yet closure change feels more epiphanic than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from painting to glowing graffiti and ghost emergence; on-page Charged Poise closure in ghost's nod and dissipation reconfigures her silence with felt emotional cost legible in "heart light"; orientation anchored early in courtyard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and storm constrain timing via elastic time between lightning/thunder, charging final image; sensory details like ozone scent and chimes integrate purposefully through her creation, mirroring internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating needs signaled early tightens accumulatively as sensation intensifies and graffiti glows, forcing completion; agency in encode action narrows options with implied cost of prior silence, though no sharp reversal tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of voicelessness bridged via art/code emerges organically from mural unfolding stories; final image of enduring graffiti offers resonant non-literal answer to isolation without moralizing, though some ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing of sigils and mist; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, no head-hopping or withholding; voice texture distinct in swirling patterns diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("driftingly alert," "between lightning and thunder," "tinkersong wonder") across multiple beats create template cadence, dulling propulsion in high-pressure painting/climax; overwrought figuration like "encode the whispers" borders on purple without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-code ghost and flower press bolt plate transforms tropes into organic surrealism; risk in accumulative lyric build heightens stakes toward resonant closure without gimmickry.</comment>
