<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to harness the flare is clear and intensifies via tremors, compelling the restructuring choice with embodied resolve. Interiority concrete in hands "steady and wise," but minimal contradictory impulses limit depth; sage archetype shown through actions without raw flaws surfacing under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tremor to flare capture, with RR closure in clock halt and stilling foundations, cost legible in "luminous ache." Single scene anchors orientation early ("lunar observatory suspended above the clouds"). No causality breaks; micro-turn at leaf sound pays off precisely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory's quivering panels and airless void constrain recalibration, forcing Earth recording; tremor evolution mirrors internal chaos. Crystalline dome and cloud sea charge final serene image. Vivid sensory flood ("light flooded the room") selective to climax; recurring camera/clock as micro-setting vital. Capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture flare amid tremors) signaled early, escalates via intensifying shakes and spinning hand under Accumulative lens with density peak at whirring shutter. Agency in leaf-triggered restructure forecloses failure path; cost felt in ache post-capture. One tightening sufficient; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral harnessed via chaos/constancy emerges organically from clock spin to halt and flare swirl. Final image reconfigures with non-literal resonance ("luminous ache glowed"), inviting reflection on transience without moralizing. Motifs like leaf sound tie to closure; ambiguity in ache lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias (reveres universe rhythm, notices gear subtlety). Poetic diction rhythmic ("silver blur," "whisper-soft rustle") modulates to urgency in climax. No dialogue; voice coherent but drifts repetitive under stress. Capped by Q7 artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("luminous ache" x4, "changelessly constant" x3, "foundations shake" x3, "harness the ephemeral" x3) and synonym churn (chaos/spin vs. constancy/still) pervade, dulling closure image with litany redundancy in final third. Template cadence in ending ("She..."; "The...") creates drumbeat; density low despite vivid bursts. Filter-light but scaffold obscures propulsion; artifacts disallow 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera repair as cosmic art with leaf sound in vacuum; tropes (tremor peril) transformed via astral tech and escape velocity metaphor. Premise ingenious, risk in poetic density pays off at flare capture. No derivative templates; closure reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
