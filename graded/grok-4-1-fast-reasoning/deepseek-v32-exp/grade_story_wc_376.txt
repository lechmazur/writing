<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in art and loss drives choices like piecing the map; embodied emotion peaks in "heart ache" at archive voices. Limited simultaneous contradictory impulses weaken depth, but final purpose shift earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from map piecing to journey wilts to archive CR ("lost conversations didn't go anywhere"), with conceptual cost in forgetting's weight legible in final glow. One tightening via console activation suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains journey (sectors force candor quests); toxic sky charges final glance, mirroring internal renewal. Sensory filter via artist's leaves/veins selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover conversations) tightens accumulatively via wilting leaves narrowing options to truth-seeking; child's secret beat forces trade-off with cost felt in talisman revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth-preservation emerges via leaf reactions and archive voices; final image ("leaves...glowed...inscribe those moments") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (leaf veins, gilding); rhythmic texture modulates from tremulous studio to aching archive without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in journey beats; minor paraphrase loops on "reread" and "wilts" drag propulsion slightly, but closure image clear and varied rhythm supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lie-detecting leaves and zinc archives transforms post-apoc tropes; risk in leaf-candor mechanic heightens stakes organically.</comment>
