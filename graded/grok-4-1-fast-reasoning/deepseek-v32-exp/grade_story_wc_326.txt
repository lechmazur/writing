<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via heartbeat counting and shard handling reveals contradictory impulses (reckless ambition vs. acceptance); earned change peaks when "heartbeat slowed... steady rhythm of acceptance." Minor diagnostic phrasing ("failure was not a monster, but a teacher") borders therapy-speak but embodies cost through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ink patterns densify memories toward RR (Charged Poise in "for the first time, she did not count"); on-page cost legible in shard's reweighting from breakage to relic. Orientation anchored early ("opal observatory... buried under... snow"); closure image reconfigures options undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains reflection (ice-encased hush enables "midnight solace"); ink pool as micro-setting charges pivotal visions and mirrors internal shift ("patterns coalesced... settling"). Sensory hierarchy (hiss, cold floor, shimmering) filters through Elara's priorities without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fetch wisdom) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ink revelations narrowing self-blame; agency in focusing on ink forecloses denial with felt cost ("visceral... explosion... Kael was not"). Escalation coheres under lens despite quiet tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from failure emerges organically through ink visions and shard reprise, resonating in non-literal final image ("did not count"); avoids moralizing despite near-echo ("wisdom she sought"). Complexity lingers in accepted loss without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (shifting ink, fading ghost); rhythmic modulation peaks in ink sequence ("delicate, transient lines... coalesced"). Ghost's synthesized voice distinct and goal-driven; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in ink visions propels via varied rhythm; purposeful poetic texture (opalescent air) taught early. Closing paraphrase loops ("deep, peaceful quiet... absolute quiet... solace of midnight") create synonym churn dulling final image, with minor template cadence in declaratives.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink defragmentation and digital ghost transforms failure trope into resonant CR; porcelain shard's evolution feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to sci-fi introspection.</comment>
