<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel merging choice with felt cost, but interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "ego death survivor" and "emotional numbness" without enough contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; final spark embodies change effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (Rin instructs → Kael realizes duplicate tie → proposes merging → DC closure via surge and emotion flood); on-page closure decisive with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored early in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating dojo and energy lines constrain merging ritual and charge final image; shimmering air and rewriting history mirror internal numbness vividly through POV filter; selective sensory details (biotic light, psychic reverberations) integrate into action without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody battle tied to numbness) signaled early, tightens via Kael's realization of personal tie narrowing options; agency in proposal/renunciation of factions drives causal escalation; cost legible in risked destabilization and numbness breach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites/duality emerges organically from brain tie and merging without statement; final shared consciousness offers resonant reconfiguration reweighting identity premise; no moralizing, ambiguity in timeline anchor lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (truth-slicing amid numbness); dialogue natural, goal-driven (Rin's instruction, Kael's announcement advances stakes); rhythmic control modulates to surge intensity without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on numbness ("fortress he desperately needed to breach," "inner void") and repetitive "shimmered/shimmering" dull peak beats slightly; no scaffold in closure surge image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego death, clone duplicate, and history-rewriting into merging opposites transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in philosophical custody war heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Kael's attribute.</comment>
