<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover raw truth drives consistent micro-choices like rearranging debris, with embodied tension in her pounding heart during parley. Interior conflict emerges in confronting painful compromises, but epiphanies like "she understood then that her work... was... confrontation" lean toward summary over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as debris arrangements build density of visions and whispers toward Conceptual Repricing closure: diary etched open on lap with burden of truth. Causal triggers (touching diary, each arrangement unlocking scenes) narrow options cleanly across two shards; no orientation debt, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon's black glass surface constrains messages by shimmering scenes on rearrangement, charging final image of dunes below zeppelin. Sensory details like sand grains, cool air, and driftwood integrate purposefully through goal-directed action; body as micro-setting (toes in sand) mirrors urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (full vs sanitized truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening revelations of moral dilemmas in vision scenes, forcing stance crystallization in resolve to share despite controversy. Agency in debris trials shows trade-offs; cost legible in "weight... settled on her shoulders" and foreclosed comfort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth's painful tension emerges organically from parley dialogue ("some truths... too painful") and complex visions, reweighting history's sanitized premise in final Charged Poise of burden and peace without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in diary's etched words and cloud-gazing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (archivist's reverence for fragile pages, historical weight). Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You have come to parley"); rhythmic prose modulates from vision intensity to quiet close without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with lines like "grains of sand between her toes, the cool night air" advancing sensory propulsion; rhythm varies for ear. Minor loops in "truth/secrets" synonyms and "she felt" stems across reflection beats dull peak slightly, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive trap, debris cipher, and zeppelin library transforms civil-rights trope into visceral parley with past; debris method's inevitability grows from activist diaries hint. Risky visionary shard pays off in charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
