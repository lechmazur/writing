<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's calm demeanor and motivation to transmute pain via art compel sharing with Mr. Hemlock, earning a subtle change in community bonds. Interiority concrete in observing details others miss, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Mr. Hemlock's emotional reveal forces her micro-choice to weave his story, revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo archiving to gathering/exhibition, tightening via locals' arrival. Closure as Charged Poise in final sunset image reconfigures pain-to-resilience with felt communal cost. Orientation anchored early in lavender field/ruins; one meaningful deepening via Hemlock's photo recognition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: lavender scent contrasts metallic decay, vines recur to mirror reclamation and charge final image. Field constrains by enabling gatherings, ruins provide photo subjects. Vines' climb evolves causally, grounding spatial choreography without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing via art) signaled early, deepens accumulatively with Hemlock's grief-sharing narrowing to communal solidarity. One tightening: individual photos to exhibition forces trade-off of suppressed pain. Cost legible in tears/memories, but stakes remain somewhat abstract/emotional without sharper visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-resilience emerges organically from arcs/photos/vines, resonating in "Lavender Echoes" exhibition without moralizing. Final image reprices ruins as reborn, reweighting prior decay. Earnest complexity via Hemlock's loss avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward overlooked details; voice modulates poetically yet consistently. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in Hemlock's trembling recognition. Rhythmic texture suits accumulative lyricism, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops (vines climbing repeated 4x without new pressure) and purple flourishes ("visual symphony," "tapestry") dull density in mid-beats. Template cadence in descriptive runs ("she [noticed/arranged/documented]"). Propulsion varies but scaffold drags momentum; closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist-healer trope via puzzle-archiving in contrasting field/ruins, transformed by photo-arcs and vine motif. Exhibition as "Lavender Echoes" offers non-obvious communal payoff. Risks earnest whimsy without gimmickry, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
