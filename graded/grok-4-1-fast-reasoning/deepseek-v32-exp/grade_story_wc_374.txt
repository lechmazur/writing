<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in skepticism drives inquiry and approach to the man; embodied via glow and taste-sensing. Internal conflict in wavering doubt acts in scene before realization. Minor label-speak in "luminous skeptic" and summary epiphany slightly dulls peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to CR closure in "futuristic nostalgia washed over her," reweighting interconnectedness with legible nostalgic cost. Orientation anchored early on bluff. Single scene causality intact via ring guidance to man.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Taste changes and ring constrain choices (e.g., "needle quiver toward the valley"); sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency. Lavender bluff and aurora evolve causally, charging final flare. Recurring tastes mirror internal shift, qualifying 9+ constraint on final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn weather origins) signaled early, deepens texturally via ring steadying on man and dialogue revelation. Agency in descent/approach forecloses ignorance; cost felt in "pang of nostalgia" and self-carried weather. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of intertwined beings/earth emerges organically via anchors explanation, no statements; final "calm, clear sky in her heart" offers non-literal resonant answer to quest. Complexity in bittersweet nostalgia avoids tidy moral. Motifs like tastes reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in taste/glow bias; voice textured, modulates lyric under realization. Dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You feel it too"), advances revelation. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in "tasted the air" (3x) and minor purple drifts ("terrestrially cosmic bridge") dull density without payoff; rhythm varies but template stems in descriptions drag momentum. High info density overall, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taste-compass, weather-carriers, voting forests transforms tropes into organic premise; risk in lyric sensoriality heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight convergence feels singular. 9+ via non-obvious angle on personal-cosmic link.</comment>
