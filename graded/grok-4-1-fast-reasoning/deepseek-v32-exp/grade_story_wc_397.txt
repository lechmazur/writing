<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied shift from suicide intent to purpose via trawling micro-choices, but repetitive diagnostic phrasing like "a fold in patience" dilutes particularity in pivotal meditative beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation at marina and layered density toward CR closure in "lace brushing against ice" realization, cost felt in transcended fear; one tightening via parasol pull suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Icy slurry, creaking ice, and misting breath selectively constrain trawling and mirror blurred perception; parasol tip charges final image as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning endings' sound tightens accumulatively through immersive listening/endurance, agency in continued trawling forecloses death path with legible emotional cost at realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Endings-as-lace-rustle image reweights premise organically from ruin to renewal without moralizing; emerges via parasol motif evolution, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with biased perceptual signature (blurring edges, whole-being listening); rhythmic modulation fits meditative pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("gripping reality loosely" x3, "fold in patience" x3) and synonym churn (chaos/ruin/debris) across meditative beats dull density and touch closure image; template cadence in repetitive trawling sentences triggers -1.2 total.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourist in ice marina trawling for existential sounds transforms tropes via lace-ice resonance; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
