<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in preservation drives all choices, with infinite patience embodied in decoding process; shift to guardian earned via sustained decoding. No strong contradictory impulses shown in scene, but micro-choices under fog pressure reveal values. Final knot addition marks credible endurance with felt cost of time invested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from knot decoding to patterns coalescing and fulgurite pulse, yielding Charged Poise closure as Elara becomes guardian. Orientation anchored early in dock/harbor/snow. Cost legible in "profound shift within" after eternity of work, reconfiguring her path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt/fish rope scent, fog swallowing sounds, breath clouds) selectively filter through Elara's patient gaze, mirroring internal stillness. Rope and fulgurite constrain decoding choices; golden dock under snow charges final emergence from fog. Environment evolves causally with fog retreat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax weavers for preservation knowledge) signaled early, tightens via "patterns coalesce into coherent knowledge" after patient decoding under thickening fog. Agency in decoding forecloses failure path with time cost. Weavers' test forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Preservation-as-weaving theme emerges organically from knots, seeds, and weavers' lore, reweighted in final knot addition and journal burning. Subtext in patience as "thread that connects past to future" resonates without statement. Ending image of Elara walking with glowing fulgurite offers non-literal answer to knowledge loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in forest-still eyes and hush-obsessed noticing biases toward subtle energies. Voice texture modulates rhythm with fog density, diction purposeful (e.g., "tapestry of knots"). Minimal dialogue natural, weavers' murmur carries implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short decoding pulses amid longer atmospheric breaths; high density integrates action/image. Minor repetition of "patience" and fog motifs taught as pattern without loop. No scaffold or muddled figures; closure line "oceanic hush lingering...sacred vow" propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed preservation, knot-language, fulgurite lens, and mist-weavers transforms folklore tropes via Elara's grounded patience. Risk in lyric accumulative build heightens stakes; final knot/reprise inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
