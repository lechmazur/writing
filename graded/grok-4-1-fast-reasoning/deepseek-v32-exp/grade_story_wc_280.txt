<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic traits embodied concretely ("tasting the colors of dusk as tart citrus"), driving micro-choices like coin-casting; internal conflict between despair and possibility acts in climax singing. Final redemption earned with visible cost of accepting ghostly stasis. Minor deduction for archetypal ghost longing without deeper flaws complicating peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via echo density building to RR closure ("timelines snap into place"); oriented early in hedge maze/orchard. Pivotal coin-spin incites tightening, orchard response deepens; cost legible in "brink of despair yawn[ing]" resisted on-page. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic sensory hierarchy (rustle as "whispered sonatas") filters POV bias; orchard constrains via bending trees forming "natural proscenium" and glowing fruits charging climax image. Details evolve causally with echoes, mirroring internal renewal without overt symbolism. Recurrent silver apples anchor tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timeline renewal) signaled early, escalates via echo layering and "fractured timeline resist[ance]" under Accumulative lens; one decisive deepening in solidified echoes narrows to Charged Poise. Agency in singing forecloses stagnant eternity with felt despair cost. Minor abstractness in resistance mutes visceral price slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgic renewal emerges organically from echo-weaving and synesthetic particulars, reweighting past/present bleed in final "single, shining thread of redemption." No moralizing; resonant bow image answers "eternally encore-seeking" without literalism. Counter-reading of acceptance lingers via fading dawn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("gold of a trumpet blast brushing her skin"); rhythmic modulation builds under pressure. No dialogue or head-hopping. Slight overwriting risks distance drift in peak metaphors, but voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload in climax ("painted the air in weeping violets and hopeful yellows"; prismatic shadows) mixes vehicles across peak beat, dulling momentum (−0.6). Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops. Minor scaffold in echo repetitions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost weaving timelines via tarot coin transforms haunted theater trope into fresh Accumulative synthesis; orchard/maze integration feels inevitable. Risky poetic texture heightens stakes without gimmickry; final reconfiguration non-obvious yet earned from particulars.</comment>
