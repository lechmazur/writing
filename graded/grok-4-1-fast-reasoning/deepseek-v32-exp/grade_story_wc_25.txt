<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove whispers over shouts drives micro-choices like the coin proposition to Kael; Kael's arc from suspicion to awe feels earned via her subtlety. Minor telling in direct creed articulations slightly undercuts embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal challenge-to-reveal chain into accumulative creed proof) holds to CR closure in Kael's realization and final worker rescue, with felt cost of subtlety foreclosing direct shouts. Orientation anchors early in labyrinth-storm setup; one tightening via hidden panel suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm's emerald pulses scramble tech and paint walls, constraining digital maps and charging Elara's paper map tactics; containers' seams enable hidden relay choice. Recurrent labyrinth mirrors creed, evolving with storm's wane to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove creed amid inspection pressure) deepens accumulatively through Kael's intrigue and worker rescue, narrowing to her whisper efficacy with visible relational cost in his softened gait. Agency in quiet challenges forces his stance shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges via coin balance and key metaphor shifting to worker guidance, reweighting shouts as lost in final image without moralizing. Subtlety vs bluster subtext charges Kael's awe; minor explicit whispers refrain borders overtness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Elara's perceptual bias (walks over visuals) distinct from Kael's barked dialogue; subtext in her soft proposition advances plot. Rhythm modulates with storm's charged air, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density weaves storm hues into action; varied syntax propels from inspection to relay reveal. Minor paraphrase loops in "whispers travel farther" phrasing dull two beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Walk-ID attribute synthesizes fresh navigation in storm-maze port; zodiac coin-key duo transforms guard trope into creed crucible. Risky quiet closure via folding map feels inevitable from setup.</comment>
