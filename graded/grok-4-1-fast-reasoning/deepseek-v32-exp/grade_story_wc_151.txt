<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in resistance, shown via chalking and checking Orion's profile, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or genuine flaws complicating choices; competence dominates without struggle, as in smooth task completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in mailing ("dropped the letter in"), felt cost in "pang of futuristic nostalgia" and readiness; orientation anchored early, one tightening via "Orion's identity might be compromised."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Golden arcade vividly constrains chalking on tiles and mailing at dropbox, charges final image of "corridor of gold"; selective sensory (light shimmering, cool surface) filtered through Elara's nostalgic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe letter passage) signaled early, one accumulative deepening via compromise realization narrows options, but pressure remains low-key with abstract "silent war" scale untested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths/resistance emerges via chalk codes and margins without statement; final "arcade stood silent, a testament to...human connection" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting nostalgia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing light/symbol contrasts), rhythmic texture purposeful but mildly repetitive; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops restate task ("juxtapose...margins," "carefully inventive" variants across paragraphs) and template cadence ("She carefully/with a deft motion"); dulls propulsion in mid-section inventory beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk codes in nostalgic arcade for mail espionage transforms tropes; "codes in children's sidewalk chalk" inflected uniquely to heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
