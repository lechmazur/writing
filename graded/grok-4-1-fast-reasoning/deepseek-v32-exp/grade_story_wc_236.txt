<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to heal without smell drives micro-choices like entering the shop and sharing the screw tale, earning her reconfiguration with embodied absence as cost. Repairman applies targeted pressure via object lesson. Contradictory impulses in scentless grief layer realistically until client scene resolves via adaptation, though epiphanies border unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from fog entry to screw exchange tightening stake, culminating in CR closure where final fog emergence reweights loss with conceptual cost of redefined healing legible in "she could still heal, by listening." Orientation anchors immediately; single scene + aftermath shard coheres without drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog and shop's "ticking shadows" and water drip constrain perception, mirroring Elara's occluded senses and charging screw's tactile history in palm. Sensory hierarchy favors feel/sound over absent smell; details evolve from muffling calm to lifting fog, guiding insight without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of scentless healing signaled early tightens via screw's transfer, narrowing options to metaphorical practice with felt cost of absence in client tears. Accumulative cadence deepens pressure coherently; agency in listening/sharing forecloses aroma reliance, though stakes stay somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles emerges from screw's repurposed resilience and client grief, reweighting loss non-literally in final fog image without moral. Subtext in silences and occluded views invites ambiguity; minor slip in repairman's "read between the lines" echoing thesis deducts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with scent-biased perceptual signature ("could feel but not smell") modulates rhythm under insight pressure. Dialogue natural/subtextual in repairman's precise lines vs. Elara's confession; syntax reflects quiet intensity without filter stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density in fog/shop images propels accumulatively, but paraphrase loops on "ordinary miracles," "occluded views," and "emotional terrain" across middle (e.g., repeated post-shop mapping) drag momentum by −0.8 total. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aromatherapist's anosmia with water clock screw as birthing metaphor transforms loss trope organically. Risk in occluded healing path heightens stakes uniquely; no derivative echoes, feels inevitable in client application.</comment>
