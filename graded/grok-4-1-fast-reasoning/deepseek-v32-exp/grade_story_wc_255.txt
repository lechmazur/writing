<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to awaken sight roots in colorblind trait and intensifies via painting challenge, earning shift to imperfection with embodied brushstrokes; Maestra applies pressure effectively as secondary. Minor slip in summarized "inner shift" dilutes contradiction slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imperfections accumulate to CR closure in reed's hum and Elian's realization, with legible conceptual cost of traded fixation; single scene anchors orientation early, one tightening via painting suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Courtyard's glass, plants, and cracked fountain constrain choices (paint flaws) and charge painting beat's final image; sensory details selective via Elian's gray perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (barter awakening) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through plant challenge to paint imperfections, narrowing options with agency in art; cost felt in foreclosed color vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect beauty emerges from particulars (phoenix grays, cracked fountain, reed), resonant in CR ending; repeated explicit phrasing ("beauty in imperfection") borders echo, muting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with colorblind perceptual bias; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven; rhythmic modulation supports lyric tone, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in ending ("beauty in imperfection," "awakening" x4+) and synonym churn dull closure image (−1.2); density solid otherwise, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind painter bartering concertina reed for plant-communicated challenge transforms tropes organically; risk in magic realism heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
