<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied motivation shines in cello plucks triggering memories; gloomy cheerfulness reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final realization earned via accumulated reflections with felt cost of quest's end. Minor slip in overt diagnostic lines like "The riddle is you."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hums densify patterns of memory/objects to CR closure where "decoding meant embracing the journey" reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost in faded quest. Orientation anchored immediately; single scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cliff observatory constrains isolation, mirrors dying dreams; recurring cello/shell/compass as micro-settings charge final image, evolving with hums. Sensory weave (wind, salt, glows) selective via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early, escalates via hum-density accumulating insights under Accumulative lens; agency in retelling forecloses answers with legible cost in "sad laugh" acceptance. One deepening suffices cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of journey-over-destination emerges from myth-busting particulars; final image (objects resting, echo carried) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior material. Avoids overt morals but borders pseudo-profundity in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (mythic symbols); rhythmic hum echoes purposeful, modulating intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with hum cadence; high density integrates action/reflection. Minor patterned loops ("resonant hums," "gloomy cheerfulness") purposeful but slight scaffold in repetitive reimagining stems dulls one peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting via cello hums and ephemeral compass transforms tropes; gloomy cheerfulness risks bold tone-heightening stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
