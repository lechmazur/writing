<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to break free roots choices consistently, culminating in earned refusal of Thorn with felt cost; contradictory impulses act in the sidestep and escape. Diagnostic labels like "fortified vulnerability" and repeated "watchfully calm" verge on therapy-speak in peak beats, diluting embodiment without full dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of observations tightening to ledger discovery and Thorn confrontation; Charged Poise closure crystallizes autonomy with legible cost in "No" and escape. Orientation anchors early via Elara in tunnels; single scene fits defaults without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tunnel details (cracked concrete, drips, rusted rail) constrain discoveries and evade via sidestep; lantern charges final image as beacon of freedom on desk. Sensory hierarchy reflects empirical focus, mirroring internal resolve without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose negligence to escape control) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ledger to Thorn's lunge narrowing options; refusal forecloses submission path with on-page relational cost. Agency in clutch/stand/sidestep drives tightening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilient autonomy emerges organically from particulars (ledger, lantern, memories) reweighting control to liberation; final image of reforms and desk lantern offers non-literal resonance. Minor overtness in "tapestry of resilience" edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward empirical details; dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Give me that"), subtext-laden in Thorn's authority vs Elara's defiance. Repetitive phrasing slightly erodes distinct texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("watchfully calm," "empirical observation," "entangled memories," "reverberate") create template cadence across beats, dulling propulsion; paraphrase redundancy in vulnerability/resolution descriptors. Density suffers in high-pressure confrontation with stacked modifiers; rhythm varies but artifacts obscure climax clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of investigator heritage via lantern/memories transforms escape trope into textured emancipation; risk in ancestral overlay heightens stakes organically. Prompt echoes slightly limit inevitability, but closure reconfigures meaningfully.</comment>
