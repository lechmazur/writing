<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through search to realization; interiority concrete in "wistful ache for eras long vanished." Earned change at closure via prior discoveries, but minor epiphanic summary in final paragraphs slightly dilutes embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from search to uncapping, culminating in CR closure where "driftwood nostalgia softened into acceptance" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening at gears discovery suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "boots crunching on frosted stone" and mirrors showing "laughing children, falling stars" filter through Elara's priorities. Recurring ice constrains search; hall of mirrors charges final image. Minor tourist-catalog risk in library intro, but integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn rhythm) signaled early, escalates via prophecy/gears/hall under Accumulative lens with cadence shift at uncapping narrowing to realization. Agency in intuitive search and gear use; cost legible in softened nostalgia. One tightening sufficient, but abstract stakes occasionally dilute visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of repair as natural cycles emerges organically from particulars like gears' hum and mirrors' clockwork. Final image offers resonant CR without moralizing: "every broken thing held a beat waiting to be restored." Avoids platitudes; minor risk of tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in locksmith-tuned noticing (e.g., "hummed with a faint, mechanical pulse"). Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically; purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences at uncapping); high density integrates image/action. Minor paraphrase loops in light descriptions ("hauntingly bright," "ethereal glow") and repeated "soft hush" ding propulsion slightly. No artifacts touch closure; clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith-temporal mythos in frozen library; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry. "Lunar-eclipse locksmith" transforms tropes organically; turns inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
