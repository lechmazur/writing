<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in skepticism and loss intensifies compellingly through memory unfold; embodied pain in shell's pulse reveals contradictory impulses effectively. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "translating isolation" borders on label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising to resonant reconfiguration at "the archive was complete"; closure Charged Poise legible in shift to "steady courage" with emotional cost of confronted pain. Orientation anchored early in garden arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Velvet moss and resonance stones constrain ritual choices tactilely; dawn transition mirrors internal reconfiguration, charging final image purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of independence signaled early deepens accumulatively via memory reveal narrowing emotional options; agency in guiding structures and whispering release forces trade-off with pain cost visible in pulsing shell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-purpose emerges organically from shell/light motifs shifting at dawn image; resonant non-literal answer in "relic of her journey" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in magical-skeptic noticing (vibrations, whispers); rhythmic prose modulates tension well, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops in final third ("ghostly resolve," "translated isolation," "new beginning") create template cadence dulling closure propulsion; synonym churn on transformation repeats without density gain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emotional archiving via resonance structures offers fresh magical-realist synthesis transforming loss trope; velvet garden's twilight-dawn arc feels inevitable and risk-taking.</comment>
