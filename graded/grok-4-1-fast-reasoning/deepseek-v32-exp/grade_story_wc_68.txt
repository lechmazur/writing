<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between doubt and determination shown through embodied actions like pocketing the cog and scraping layers; final endurance earned by prior agony. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("rationally rebellious") repeated without full embodiment slightly undercuts peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from descent to findings (charts, plate); Charged Poise closure in final resolve reconfigures purpose with felt grinding cost legible in "weight of that struggle in her bones." Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sedimentary layers and cog as micro-settings constrain choices (scraping reveals clues) and charge final image (brass plate with equations); sensory details (damp stone, dim glow) selectively mirror internal order-seeking amid decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve methods vs. forgetting/myths) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through findings and memory of overheard group; endurance agency forecloses isolation path with cost in "abrasive calm" under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empirical truth vs. myths emerges organically from particulars (cog as "silent rebuke," unearthed charts); final image of continued scraping offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting chaos with purpose sans moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (logical scrutiny of layers/cog); rhythmic control modulates calm determination, though minor repetition risks convergence; no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("agonized" x3, "competing narratives" x3, "abrasive calm" x2) creates paraphrase loops and template cadence across middle beats, dulling propulsion; density good otherwise, but artifacts drag momentum before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague sewer philosopher preserving navigation relics transforms tropes via sedimentary archaeology and cog motif; risk in abrasive rationalism heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
