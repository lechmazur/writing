<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's scattered memories create genuine internal friction, embodied in her cracking voice and desperate humming, compelling the climactic song with visible cost. Final coalescence feels earned by persistent micro-choices under pressure. Contradictory fragility and resolve act simultaneously throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from scattered hums to swelling song, culminating in RR (light weaves, memories coalesce) with conceptual cost in the brink's stillness paid via persistence. Orientation anchors immediately in greenhouse and mirror world. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mica window and phosphorescent plants constrain choices (directing song, responding to light) and charge closure image (plants burst in growth). Sensory details (cool crystalline surface, humming air) filter through Elara's urgency, evolving causally. Recurrent greenhouse dome mirrors internal lattice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift from thin notes to communal swell forces stance crystallization with agency in swaddling. Tightening forecloses isolation path; cost legible in cracking voice and brink moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unity-from-fragments emerges organically via song threads and community echoes, reweighting scattered premise in final tapestry image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like lullaby's instinctive nurture avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual bias toward memory fragments and light-threads; rhythm modulates from fragile hum to swelling harmony under stress. Perceptual signature distinct in alchemical particulars; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in "layers of harmonious sound." Minor paraphrase in song effects (knit/weave) purposeful under lens, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-seed, song-as-blanket transforms fading-realm trope; mica window and woven dawns feel inevitable, with risk in lyric accumulation heightening renewal stakes.</comment>
