<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels like "eloquently silent" and summary visions rather than embodied, contradictory impulses; micro-choices (winding gramophone, walking to window) feel passive without revealing value hierarchy under pressure. Epiphany emerges told via "he saw images" without concrete sensory anchors. No safety-hedging flaws complicate the realization moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: music's standing waves build density to CR closure ("The dynasty ender was no more"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of pawn-role acceptance. Orientation anchored immediately in sepia room. One tightening via intuition bridge suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gramophone as micro-setting constrains musing choice and charges final image ("gramophone crank handle... purpose served"). Sensory selection (gears' whir, pulsing shadows) purposeful, POV-biased toward introspection. Atmosphere coheres without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via music-amplified memories narrowing to manipulation revelation; agency in listening/accepting forecloses haunted stasis with felt transformation cost. Pressure coheres texturally without reversal requirement. Climax realization carries legible price in new purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of imposed role vs. redemption emerges organically from particulars (music-triggered conspiracy), final image as "dynasty healer" offers resonant CR without moralizing. Recurring shadows shift warmly, avoiding binaries. Minor pseudo-profundity in "bridge of intuition" slightly abstracts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with distinct lyrical texture (poetic wave/shadow diction) biased toward intuitive perception; voice modulates introspectively without leakage. No dialogue or elision issues. Rhythmic control suits accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound in ending ("he realized... he accepted... he stood"), with repetitive stems ("The [element] seemed") creating template cadence across 4+ sentences; synonym churn on shadows/intuition dulls closure image. Figurative density overwrites high-pressure revelation without payoff. Propulsion suffers from redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Standing waves as intuition bridge offers fresh synthesis on reflection trope, transforming gramophone into memory tool organically. Prompt-like elements (dynasty ender motif) feel stitched without bold risk. Transformation test passes via specific poetic logic.</comment>
