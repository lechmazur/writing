<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unite silos via clock repair compels climax choices with embodied empathy; strength in micro-choices guiding representatives, minor weakness in scant contradictory impulses during repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with plan summoning reps leading to reattachment; closure DC in clock chiming reconfigures silos with felt communal cost on final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower's gears and starlight constrain alignment choice and charge final chime image; sensory details purposefully mirror harmony motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of clock unity escalates causally through reps' contributions narrowing discord to harmony; agency in Elara's guidance forces trade-off with visible relational reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Unity theme emerges from repair events and final chime resonance; deduct for explicit "grain elevator talk" articulating thesis near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with choral-inflected perceptual signature; dialogue distinct and goal-driven among reps, rhythm modulates effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies but minor overwrite with stacked metaphors ("symphony of scores," "vigorous tender") and "borrowed starlight" repeats dull early density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh silo-to-clock synthesis transforms unity trope through specific choral jargon and weight etchings; risk in multi-rep choreography heightens ingenuity.</comment>
