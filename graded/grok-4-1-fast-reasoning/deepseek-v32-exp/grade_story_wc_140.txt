<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in fragment collection, culminating in earned realization of past with embodied cost ("bitter taste of arsenic"); minor lack of shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat limits to very strong band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with fragment density building to pattern-break closure (RR/CR at overheard officials' names, reconfiguring identity with "past but no future" cost legible in final image); orientation anchored early in containers/port, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Port/container labyrinth and tides constrain search pace and charge metaphors (mind as maze), filtering through POV's layered perception; sensory details (echoing footsteps, slime-covered pilings) evolve causally with tides, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory texture recovery) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (label find → fragment accumulation → officials' whisper), narrowing to charged poise with isolation cost; one decisive intensification sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Erased identity theme emerges organically from fragment palimpsest, resonant CR in final image reweighting premise (search ends painfully whole); ambiguity lingers in "no future" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("layered potential, hollow chambers"); rhythmic prose mirrors accumulative layering, modulating intensity without head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; purposeful figurative layering (palimpsest) integrates without muddle, though occasional density borders overwrite in process descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amnesiac trope via textural port-maze collection transforms into inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
