<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in diagnosis and crystallizes actions effectively; gentle systematic trait shown through deliberate work. Lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene for deeper interior conflict, relying on told calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of environmental changes building to Charged Poise closure in final sketch of intertwined oak/pillar. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via observed responses forecloses inaction path with her weakening body as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like shifting pillars and copper gleam integrate into actions, constraining choices via diary patterns and orchard responses. Sensory selection reflects her systematic observation; final crystalline veins charge closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fostering respect tightens accumulatively through observed changes (oak curving, stag bowing), narrowing options with time/body cost. Agency in systematic remodeling drives escalation; cost legible in her final days.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies harmony emerges organically from particulars like copper lattice and pillar veins, reweighted in stag gesture and final sketch without moralizing. Resonance ties to her legacy, inviting reflection on connection's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in precise, unhurried observations matching her calm. Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in action-integrated details. Minor loops in "brazen calm" and method repetition dull propulsion slightly; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical/architectural magic via copper-oak resonance transforms tropes of dying wish into tangible ecosystem dialogue. Risky living pillars feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
