<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to outwit tricksters drives desperate broadcast with embodied stress ("deep, steadying breath"); internal conflict in cautious hope vs. risk feels earned. Evans as secondary pressures via confrontation, shifting status dynamically. Minor label-speak ("cautiously hopeful") slightly genericizes interiority at start.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal pattern taunts → bypasses protocols → activates subsonic → stutter disrupts with career risk cost ("forbidden... backlash"). Orientation anchored by para 1; closure DC (signal gone) + RR (resolve firms) on-page with legible price in Evans's entry. One tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Control room consoles, waterfall display, charts constrain choices ("cross-referenced... pinpointing coordinates"); thrumming felt in bones charges success beat. Sensory hierarchy (hiss, hum, static) reflects Aris's professional urgency. Final quieting outside mirrors internal shift, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disrupt signal before violence) tightens via forbidden broadcast, narrowing to career gamble; agency in activation forecloses safe path. Escalation causal: success then Evans confrontation tests commitment. Cost visible in "monumental risk" and grudging respect reweight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of outwitting chaos emerges via signal as manipulative game, resolved in counter-signal + community soothe without moralizing. Final image ("shield... first line of defense") resonantly reconfigures premise from pawn to guardian. Subtext in Evans's shift adds ambiguity to power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (ethereal signals as taunts); voice modulates grit in short sentences at activation ("He activated the sequence."). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("I interfered... You took a monumental risk") advances status. Rhythmic control under stress clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to climax; no loops, but minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("white noise sea... ethereal void") slightly dulls early propulsion. "Power play" recurrence purposeful for theme. Closure image clear, no artifacts touching stutter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic tricksters via subsonic counter transforms SETI trope into personal duel. Risk in unproven method heightens stakes organically. Final resolve ("he would be ready") feels inevitable from charts/grit setup, no hedging.</comment>
