<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent from start, driving dive and vow; interiority concrete in synesthetic wonder at orb but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Change feels earned via accumulative discoveries, but embodied emotions lean declarative over conflicted under submersion stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tag find to orb revelation as CR closure with protective vow as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in pier work; single arc fits scope with purposeful progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and POV-biased (lamplighter notes flames resonating post-revelation); sunken library constrains dive choice via fissure and air pocket, charging final image with lantern patterns on walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color of sound) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through tag/orb discoveries narrowing perceptual options; agency in securing boat/dive shows endurance with implied submersion risk as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sensory truths emerges organically from quest events and orb hues; final image of flames resonating in color offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting perception without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (melody hues); rhythmic prose modulates from calm pier to intensifying hum, consistent diction fits haunted seeker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in library chamber; minor paraphrase loops ("meteor hush," lanterns) purposeful for tone but slightly drag momentum pre-orb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic premise (sound colors via orb/vows) fresh synthesis of lamplight and sunken lore; transforms treasure trope through perceptual reconfiguration with irreplaceable sensory payoff.</comment>
