<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to refract truth drives consistent choices like poem recitals, revealed through mischievous smiles amid solemnity; interiority concrete in her joy at unraveling. Minor slip: contradictory impulses (defiance vs. ritual) told more than shown acting simultaneously in a peak beat like the final poem.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poem beats densify refraction pattern toward CR closure in "the true price of forgiveness was understood: it was not a single act, but a lifetime," with conceptual cost of multiplied truths legible. Single scene oriented early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain poetry choice by amplifying refractions; recurring spire charges final image as "unchanged... but the air around it was now thick with echoes." Sensory hierarchy fits Elara's artistic bias, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract truth before ritual) signaled early, escalates via density of poem layers and listener reactions narrowing to weighted multiplicity; agency in recitals forces trade-off vs. singular forgiveness, cost felt in "carrying the weight" at bell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of refracted truth's forgiveness price emerges organically from poem shards; final image "a lifetime of acknowledging the refracted light" reweights premise non-literally with lingering complexity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Elara's perceptual signature in light/shard imagery; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, syntax varying for ear; purposeful "refracted" pattern avoids loops, but minor overwriting in metaphor stacks during poem beats slightly dulls peak propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-poetry refracting ritual truth in bone canyon feels inevitable; risk of lyric accumulative defiance heightens stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
