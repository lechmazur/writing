<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in eternal boredom intensifies credibly to compel the rift-step and energy-channeling; final awe-shattering earned via past-goodbye glimpses. Interiority concrete in dimensional perceptions but emotions lean abstract ("dry curiosity") without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak rift-battle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density escalation from fragment-resonance to temporal-pull trap and implosion; CR closure lands on-page with legible cost in escondite/amulet loss and reweighted immortality ("suddenly, terribly new"). Orientation anchored early (~50 words); one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prismatic crystals constrain via vibration/concentration at heart and charge final implosion to "single point of light"; sensory hierarchy (humming air, cold palm, shifting hues) narrows with crisis, filtered through dimensional awareness. Evolves causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe beyond goodbye) signaled early, tightens via trap-realization forcing desperate channeling under Accumulative lens; agency in will-focus forecloses stability with implosion cost. Escalation coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of endless hello/goodbye cycles emerges organically from rift-glimpses reweighting boredom-motif; final ordinary-cave image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity in unanswered question avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in "shimmering seams" and cosmic diction; rhythmic modulation accelerates in "twisting...kaleidoscope" peak. Purposeful compression legible under lens; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fragment...drink the prismatic light"); varied rhythm passes ear test, but patterned "hushed thunder"/"intrigue" repeats verge on loop without full payoff. Minor figurative density in climax (−0.3); no scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal boredom with amulet-provoked spacetime-rebellion transforms tropes via magnetic/solar mechanics; risk in abstract mutiny heightens cosmic stakes without gimmickry. Final regression-vision inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
