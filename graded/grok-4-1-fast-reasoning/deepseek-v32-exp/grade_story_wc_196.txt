<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to magnify kindnesses roots in heartbreak and drives research choices consistently. Interiority embodied in "heart, though broken, swelled with fragile hope," but conflict shows more in summary than simultaneous impulses. Final mending earned via discoveries without deep flaws complicating path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: button discovery layers into letters and research tightening to CR closure where peace reconfigures heartbreak with emotional cost in "sense of peace settle over her." Orientation anchored by para 1. No shards or transitions; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dust patterns as setting constrain careful handling ("avoid scattering delicate dust veils") and guide discoveries. Sensory details (brittle bindings, crackling paper) selective via archivist bias. Button micro-setting charges final display case image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal via magnifying kindnesses) signaled early; accumulative deepening via revelations narrows despair to hope. Agency in digging/research; felt cost in ongoing heartbreak until final reconfiguration. Minimal external pressure limits escalation intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of rippling kindnesses emerges from button-letters arc without statement; final image of button case reweights neglect-to-hope non-literally. Complexity in fleeting bonds vs. lasting impact; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in archival noticing ("dust...palimpsest of time"). Voice texture via rhythmic phrases like "faint glimmers buried within cold bureaucracy"; modulates to peace at end. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("dust patterns" x3, "small kindnesses" x3, "unknown history/ies") creates paraphrase loops dulling density. Figurative density ("hollow quiet that echoed," "balm on her own heartbreak") purposeful but heavy in discoveries without peak payoff. Propulsion solid overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dust-as-method transforms archival trope into textured investigation of kindness ripples. Button-soldier-foster link fresh synthesis; risk in unorthodox dust-reading pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
