<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to teach stars' value compels precise weaving choices, but interiority abstracts into repeated labels like "spiralingly calm" without embodied contradiction during ripple disturbance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density buildup to RR closure in "Elara felt the shift, a release of tension"; cost legible in foreclosed urgency, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, shutters, and mirror constrain light-weaving tactics; post-rain sheen and brooding canal charge final "dock returned to its quiet state" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens via ripple to water brightening under Accumulative lens, her agency in adjustments foreclosing despair with release cost at "child's fear began to soften."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of light from dark emerges organically via constellation patterns; final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonating in "darkness itself learned to cherish the stars."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias to water/light; rhythmic modulation supports Accumulative texture, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., repeated "spiralingly calm," "half-spoken secret") across final third dull closure propulsion; dense figuration overwrites without crisp payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-soothing via mirror/shutter star-weaving transforms tropes; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
