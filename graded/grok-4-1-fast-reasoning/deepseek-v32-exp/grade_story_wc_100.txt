<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stubborn trait compels research and prism alignment despite weariness and trembling hands at climax; embodied emotion in aching bones and steady hands elevates, but limited contradictory impulses shown in scene constrain depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain from package summons to dream-derived fix holds tightly; on-page closure via glowing lens and stilled water delivers decisive change with legible cost in days spent and trembling effort; orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlight shaft in air pocket constrains climax alignment and charges final glow; coral-encrusted ruins and floating pages filter through undertaker's priorities, vivid and purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to grant rest tightens via research reversal to dream method, narrowing options under causal lens; agency in prism work forecloses adrift souls with visible cost in sustained effort.</comment>
