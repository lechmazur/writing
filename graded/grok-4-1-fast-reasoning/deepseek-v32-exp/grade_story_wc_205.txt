<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reimagine the civilization roots consistently in her revolutionary past and poetic lens, culminating in an earned personal reconfiguration during the holographic revelation. Interiority shows contradiction between scholarly dispute and inner poetry, embodied in her handling of the shard. Minor stock phrasing like repeated "burnished sorrow" slightly dilutes particularity but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to the storm experiment as decisive tightening, yielding CR closure via holographic projection that reweights the civilization's identity with Elara's felt sorrow as cost. Orientation anchors early (Veridia, Elara, time strands). Structure fits single narrative arc with summary transitions; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid, time strands, and ion storms constrain the experiment choice, with mirrors and shard as micro-settings charging the revelation image. Sensory details (strands swirling, shard glowing) selective via Elara's poetic bias. Final museum display evolves setting to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagining civilization amid dispute) signaled early, tightens via experiment success that forecloses conventional views with emotional cost in "heart ached with a burnished sorrow." Accumulative pressure coheres through observation density; Kael's scoff adds external friction without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of poetic reimagining vs. conventional history emerges via shard interactions and mirror metaphor, resonating in CR where ancients' artfulness reweights Elara's failed revolution. Final image of glowing shard offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in locals' mirror ritual enriches without overt allegory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "time strands avoided the covered glass"). Voice modulates rhythmically, lyrical diction consistent under stress. Minimal dialogue natural; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor overwriting in opening ("weaving through the air like golden threads") and repeated "burnished sorrow" create slight scaffold in reflective beats. No loops touch closure; propulsion clear in experiment sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, archaeological poetry, and mirror rituals transforms sci-fi tropes via Elara's lens; holographic payoff feels inevitable from shard setup. Bold risk in accumulative revelation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
