<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve wonder is clear and drives actions consistently; interiority shown through embodied work but lacks contradictory impulses in climax, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure in symphony restoring wonder; cost felt in "tears to her eyes" and ongoing muteness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment and wind constrain tuning choices and charge final glistening image; sensory details filtered through Elara's priorities integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder signaled early, tightens at "color of wonder had dimmed further" with agency in fine-tuning; cost legible in seasonal endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth/wonder via action emerges organically; final sculpture image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall; minor paraphrase loops in repeated "glisten" and "symphony" descriptions slightly dull peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-verbal world, ice-bell resonance, and muted preservation feels inevitable; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes organically.</comment>
