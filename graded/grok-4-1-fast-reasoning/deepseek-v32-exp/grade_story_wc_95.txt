<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Label-speak like "diplomatically fierce, a trait honed in courts" undermines embodied traits, but mechanical arm's "whirring softly" and duel revelation show contradiction between force and diplomacy effectively; final collaboration earned by prior puzzle-solving pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with motif density building to CR closure in "We seek the same truth" declaration during lunge, reweighting rivalry with foreclosed aggression cost; orientation anchored early in atrium; single scene tightening via scroll reveal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sundial grooves and needle constrain decoding choice, charging final witness image; glass walls amplify "prismatic shards" mirroring internal chaos; brook evolves from mocking urgency to harmonious path, filtering through Kaelen's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode engagement terms) signaled early tightens via needle click to duel integration, narrowing rivalry options under accumulative lens; agency in offering scroll forces renunciation with legible relational cost in disarming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of questions-to-destinations emerges organically from sundial cipher and duel syllogisms, resonating in final brook image reweighting premise without moralizing; minor abstract intrusion in "enigma of existence" slightly dilutes emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (arm as "scorpion's tail") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm in duel clashes; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual in "Shall we begin?" / "First, consider this"; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "dignified chaos" (intro/end) and brook repetitions (mocking/soothing/path-carving) drag momentum slightly without obscuring closure; figurative density ("geometric sonata," "syllogism strikes") coherent but overwrites descriptive beats; propulsion strong in duel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosopher duel with needle-decoded sundial transforms tropes; mechanical arm integrates organically into tension without gimmick; risk in lyrical motifs heightens stakes to collaboration reconfiguration.</comment>
