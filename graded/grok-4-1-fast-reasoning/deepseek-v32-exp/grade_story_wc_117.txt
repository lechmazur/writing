<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation to nurture wonder drives Elara consistently, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Leo's pivotal shift at eclipse ("eyes widened") feels summarized without embodied micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density tightening at eclipse curl-sharing beat; RR closure lands in generational handoff with felt cost of relinquishing cherished possession; shards (future visits) taught early and cohere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oak's dreaming roots and eclipse twilight constrain session choices and charge final image; sensory hush and darkening sky selectively mirror internal awe without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle Leo's awe) signaled early, textural deepening at totality with flute adapting to breath; cautious restraint forecloses overwhelming as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically via eclipse-music-curl interplay, resonant CR in curl's passage reweighting generational premise; repetition slightly edges toward assertion over pure subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias toward subtle enchantments; rhythmic modulation suits mellow tone, no head-hopping despite shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Pervasive loops (e.g., "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" x6, "nurture lifelong wonder" paraphrases across endings) and template cadence dull propulsion; artifacts touch closure handoff, obscuring density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresh eclipse-curl totem synthesis transforms therapy trope via generational arc; risk in repetitive lyricism heightens but prompt-stitch feel limits inevitability.</comment>
