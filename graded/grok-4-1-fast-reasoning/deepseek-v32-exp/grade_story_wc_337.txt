<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to ground spirits clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like picking knots; weakness in "lucid unrest" as repeated label-speak without embodied contradiction in peak slip moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of silence building to RR closure at last knot's sigh; needle slip tightens options with legible cost in heavier air.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary and starlight constrain atmosphere and charge brighter final image; net's salt-time smell tactilely mirrors unraveling pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel net signaled early; accumulative escalation via accumulating silence and slip forces resolve with breathing cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of mending unrest emerges via net-to-peace arc; "we are all restorers" line in final dialogue borders on overt statement, diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with restorer's perceptual bias on fractures/knots; sparse dialogue natural, advances secret with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "silence," "hush," "unrest" across unraveling beats dull propulsion; repetitive stems like "She [action], her [trait]" create template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask-restorer with whisper-catching net transforms spirit trope organically; risk in metaphorical net pays off at closure without gimmick.</comment>
