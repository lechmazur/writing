<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to map walls' dreams intensifies credibly through discoveries, with embodied emotions like "weight of silent histories" and micro-choices (sifting diaries) revealing her under pressure. Interiority shows perceptive bias but slips into label-speak ("sensitively perceptive") and tidy epiphanies ("she understood that the echoes were not just sounds") without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance of burden feels earned but lacks deeper flaw-complication; the realization beat at "Her motivation deepened" prioritizes summary over dramatized conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations layer from scuff to film to diaries, tightening knowledge with density increase toward CR closure ("burden... as both a duty and a gift") where cost is felt in "heaviness." Single scene oriented early (passage post-shifts by para 1), no shards; pattern coherent without breaks. Pivotal discovery beat causal under lens, final image reconfigures stance legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (damp earth, moss-covered stone, ivy trembling) filters through Elara's perceptual bias, with passage constraining navigation and discovery (boot scuff). Mirrors internal shift subtly (ivy "sharing a secret" echoes revelation). Environment charges closure ("corridor fell silent... gentle sigh"); micro-object like satchel carries forward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping echoes/dreams) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via fireplace/diaries/film into legacy burden, narrowing to renunciation of mere cartography for "keeper of forgotten stories." Agency in sifting/extracting forces trade-off with visible cost (heaviness in satchel/steps). Escalation coherent under lens, charges final hum of hope with felt price; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of absorbed regrets/redemption emerges organically from echoes, diaries, film particulars without statement; final image ("sun set... compass guiding her") offers non-literal CR repricing loss-to-hope. Subtext in half-burned evidence vs. survival implies complexity, avoids tidy moral. Resonant aftereffect from wall-dreams motif reweighted by burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (echoes as emotions, whispers pulsing); diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled ("ivy trembling as if sharing a secret"). No head-hopping or withholding; psychic distance tightens at realizations. Voice modulates with intensity, prose as character in her sensitive noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences at scuff, flowing at realizations); density high, sentences multi-task (e.g., "fingers brushed... moved deeper" advances action/atmosphere). Minor loops ("burden"/"legacy" recur 4x/3x without churn, purposeful under theme) and paraphrase ("legacy of warning"/"burdens acknowledged") slightly drag but don't obscure closure. No artifacts in peak discovery; read-aloud propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-climate ruin with "corridor echo cartographer" premise transformed via walls-dreaming concept into memory-haunted exploration; tropes (abandoned halls, family relic) personalized through perceptual angle. Risk in lyric Accumulative closure ("hopeful hum") heightens stakes organically. Turn at film-glimpse inevitable from setup, no derivatives.</comment>
