<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to escape isolation drives choices like encoding fortunes, but interiority leans on summary labels like "heart racing"; micro-choices reveal traits under mild pressure yet lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fortune encoding therefore Leo's arrival and collaboration; closure as Charged Poise in shared purpose with isolation's cost reweighted in final lantern room image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse on rocky island anchors early and constrains choices as sanctuary/base; fog, lantern beam, rowing integrate purposefully, charging final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of life transposition signaled early tightens causally with Leo's arrival narrowing isolation options; agency in directing secrets yields visible relational cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets turning burdensome to connective emerges organically via fortunes and microdots; final weaving image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with Elara-dominant focalization; distinct perceptual signature in cryptic phrasing, but minor distance shifts to Leo without section breaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence from repeated phrases ("after last orders" 7+ times, "transpose life into a new key" 5+ times, "directing the flow") across beats dull propulsion and obscure climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookies as spycraft vectors transforms spy tropes through prophetic accidents; microdot-driven turns feel earned and inevitable.</comment>
