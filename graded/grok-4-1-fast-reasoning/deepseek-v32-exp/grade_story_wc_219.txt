<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in skepticism and luminescence drives the pilgrimage, with actions aligning consistently. Interiority leans poetic but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphany at "home was not a place but a chemical memory" feels smoothly vindicated without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building images toward CR closure ("home was not a place but a chemical memory"), with cost in resolved doubt reweighting premise. Orientation anchored early; footprints-to-revelation tightening narrows interpretive options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like overgrown sculpture path and homing statues constrain journey choices and mirror theme, charging final image of footsteps joining dusty prints. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's chemical focus; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding homecoming chemistry) signaled early, with amber placement and holographic convergence as deepening under Accumulative lens, foreclosing doubt with intellectual vindication cost. Agency via pilgrimage design; pressure coheres quietly without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of universal chemical homing emerges organically from converging holograms and sculptures, offering resonant CR ("home was not a place but a chemical memory") that reweights alien contact premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers in skeptic's acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV with luminous/chemical perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates from journey tension to chamber poise. No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful compression suits lyric Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but "bronze quiet" thrice and "dusty footprints"/"rainwashed tower" loops dull peak stillness (chamber scene), docking for paraphrase redundancy without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobiology, homing instincts, and amber relic transforms first-contact trope into chemical CR revelation; sculptures-to-holograms turn feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
