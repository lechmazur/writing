<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as peace negotiator culminates in earned sacrifice at closure, with past failures anchoring her resolve; embodied waning strength shows internal conflict under pressure. Minor telling in reflections like "bitter experience" slightly abstracts impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density building to moons' convergence; on-page closure as Resonant Reconfiguration with her fading and clipboard drop delivering legible life-force cost in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terrace mosaics and warm stones constrain ritual positioning; twin moons' dance charges final binding image, with sensory selectivity (humming air, glowing wood) mirroring urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ritual peace tightens accumulatively as reps arrive and light weaves, narrowing to her personal cost; agency in chanting/guiding forces trade-off legible in waning body.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flawed beauty and redemption emerge organically from imperfect peace web and her sacrifice; final terrace silence reconfigures ideals' price without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual bias (runes traced, light absorbed); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise at "clipboard fell from her limp fingers."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("flawed beauty," "operatively gentle") creates paraphrase loops across reflections; density strong but minor scaffold dulls peak ritual beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Celestial ritual sacrifice transforms peace trope through clipboard runes and moons' binding; fresh in fragile web image but leans on familiar redemption arc.</comment>
