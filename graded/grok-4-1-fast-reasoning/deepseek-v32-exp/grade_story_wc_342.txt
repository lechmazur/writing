<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face blindness creates genuine struggle in search via touch/scent, driving micro-choices; contradictory defiance/acceptance impulses act in final realization, earned by process with visible cost of renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: search deepens to crafting density, CR closure lands on-page ("sky, once imprisoned, lost its infinite quality... some things cannot be contained") with conceptual cost legible in rumble and peace image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tree's curved shelves constrain blind search by texture/scent; dome enables/charges mural as doomed space, mirroring internal limits in final shimmer vs. rumble.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sky mural before dawn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via safe discovery to fractal crafting under time pressure, agency-driven deepening forecloses infinite capture with felt acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of art's limits emerges organically from fractal mimicry to static "beautiful lie," final image reweights premise non-literally as rumble enforces boundless sky's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blind perceptual signature (shapes/textures over faces) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to rumble without slippage, distinct under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm; no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures (fractal curls) integrate without muddle in peak crafting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face-blind fractal sky-trapping in doomed tree synthesizes fantasy constraint originally; risk of infinite mimicry irony pays off inevitably at CR without gimmick.</comment>
