<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in childhood noticing drives scene choices consistently; interiority concrete via sensory perceptions like "scent of salt and growth." Limited contradictory impulses in the pivotal placement beat keep it from peak; realization feels earned but lacks micro-struggle cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build to orris root placement as tightening, yielding CR closure in "house seemed to sigh" with conceptual cost of reversed stagnation. Orientation anchored early in bay details; single scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via Elara's noticer bias: "cherry blossoms scattering like pink snow" integrates with quest; cottage weeds constrain entry. Recurring streetlights' glow charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive dead houses) deepens accumulatively via placement reversal; cost felt in "creaking with relief" foreclosing inert path. No agency-driven escalation beyond one beat limits high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred displacement emerges organically from particulars like seashell example; final "hushed blaze within her" offers non-literal CR resonance reweighting creeping normality. Minor overtness in realization paragraph tensions ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature in biased noticing ("shoreline shifted inch by inch"); rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense info per line with vivid propulsion, but "hushed blaze" motif overextends into template repetition across peak beats (−0.4); no loops obscure causality. Rhythm varies read-aloud, supporting accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noticing + displacement magic feels inevitable in "orris root... bridging the gap"; transforms haunted-house trope via perfumery anchor without gimmick.</comment>
