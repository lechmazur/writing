<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Leo’s contradictory impulses—phobias screaming amid adaptive focus—act in scene, earning the climax declaration; micro-choices like steady hands despite tremor reveal values with cost. Interiority concrete but edges into label-speak like "firmly adaptive." Final renunciation of fear as weakness feels motivated by prior decryption causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: backstory → child cry → decryption → phobia-exploiting trap realization → open confrontation, landing CR closure in Leo’s declaration and starlit walkaway with felt vulnerability cost. Orientation anchored early in library under stars. No lens ambiguity; constraint of seashell guides tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory (rust scent, ivy, star gleam through roof gaps) integrates into action, mirroring Leo’s corroded past while constraining decryption in alcove. Body/phobia narrows perception under open-sky pressure. Rusted shelves lean precariously, charging height fear without overt symbolism; evolves to tower base.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit Silas) signaled early, tightens causally via decryption revealing phobia trap, forcing agency in embrace-then-confront plan with trade-off cost (facing heights). Escalation narrows options; Silas’s smirk tests commitment before Leo’s stance crystallizes payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-power emerges organically from phobia decryption to declaration, reweighting premise in final image without full moralizing. Leo’s arc inextricable, but climax speech "his phobias did not cripple him; they connected him to his humanity" borders explicit thesis, muting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (phobias sharpen focus); rhythmic prose modulates tension, e.g., short breaths in library. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven (reassures Eli, calls out Silas). Perceptual signature in "each panicked breath to sharpen his focus" biases noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but overwriting in purple clusters like "cacophony of phobias... sibilant urgings coil" dulls peak decryption beat (-0.5); minor paraphrase loops on "trembling certainty." Varied rhythm propels causally without template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt-phobia code-breaking via child cast transforms betrayal trope; seashell heirloom adds non-obvious heir angle. Risky open confrontation heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
