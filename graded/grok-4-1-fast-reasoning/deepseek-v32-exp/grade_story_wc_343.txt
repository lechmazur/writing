<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Label-heavy traits like "diligently curious" and repeated "sociable isolation" flatten interior contradiction; discovery beat shows excitement but lacks embodied internal conflict or flawed micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain from luminance observation to hopscotch decoding and captain verification culminates in on-page course change (DC) with felt cost of crystallized isolation; orientation anchors early, lens holds firmly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dusty hopscotch board on deck constrains pivotal decoding choice and charges discovery image; airship's brass fittings and murmurations evolve tactilely through Elara's pattern-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elusive luminance stakes tighten via hopscotch reversal narrowing to coordinates; agency in noting/deciphering forecloses doubt, with isolation as visible relational cost charging captain's nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sociable isolation emerges organically from crew chatter vs. solo focus, reweighted non-literally in final shoulder clap that connects while affirming solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with pattern-selective perceptual signature; captain's brief dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing verification without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("sociable isolation," "noting," "diligently curious") creates paraphrase loops across beats, dulling density; discovery rhythm propels cleanly despite minor synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hopscotch-to-celestial-map decoding transforms airship discovery trope into ingenious, grounded synthesis that hindsight-makes inevitable.</comment>
