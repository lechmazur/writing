<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via fidgeting fingers tracing patterns and confronting chess missteps; interior conflict between pride and humility acts in decoding scene; final acceptance feels earned with cost of past stasis foreclosed. Minor slip in over-articulated labels like "fierce repose" belying "tempest of regret," bordering on diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from scanning tapestry to plucking thread yielding pattern, tightening to labyrinth solution; CR closure lands cleanly in "labyrinth glowed...saw his past not as a chain of errors, but as a necessary path" with emotional cost legible. Orientation anchored early in village streets; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hush (no leaf rustling, thick air) constrains distraction-free focus, charging decoding; recurring labyrinth and fingers as micro-settings enable tactile choices. Thunder subtly pressures time; body/threads mirror internal winnowing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening realization from missteps to humility test; plucking thread narrows options with agency, cost felt in revisited shame altering stance. Minor abstractness in stakes prevents peak band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of failure-to-wisdom emerges organically from chess/tapestry decoding, reweighted in final image of unburdened walk; subtext in "winnowed away the chaff...grain of hard-won wisdom" resonates without moralizing. Some explicitness like "test of humility" slightly undercuts ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias toward chess patterns/threads; voice texture consistent in woven metaphors, modulating from anxious to poised. Repetitive phrasing slightly erodes distinction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and density in decoding beats, but patterned artifacts drag: "productive fidgeting" (3x), "woven hush"/"lull of distant thunder" loops across paragraphs create synonym churn without payoff. Minor paraphrase in regret summaries dulls propulsion; closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess exile, frozen-time puzzle, tapestry code transforms redemption trope via tactile decoding; risk in fantasy hush heightens introspective stakes organically. Ingenuity peaks in thread-pluck turn arising from prior particulars.</comment>
