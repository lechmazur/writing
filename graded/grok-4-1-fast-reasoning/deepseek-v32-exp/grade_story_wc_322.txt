<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to map connections drives persistent weaving through eruption; "knot of unease tightened" effectively embodies contradiction. Limited simultaneous internal impulses acting in scene—calm dominates without much degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from weaving to eruption break and CR closure: "she was the connection, the architect of her own fever dreams," reweighting reality with "fraught with tension" cost. Orientation anchored early; pattern taught and holds cleanly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gallery as mind constrains and evolves with weaving, flickering illusions mirror turmoil; charges closure as "beautifully chaotic tapestry." Micro-setting (loom, thread) guides choices tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of controlling enchantment tightens via eruption as pattern break under Accum lens, narrowing to rewrite history; agency in "continued weaving, methodically" forecloses uncontrolled chaos with memory alteration cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of self-woven connection emerges organically from particulars like distorted childhood memory-weave; final image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing. Minor direct statement of motivation early borders abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pattern/connection noticing; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity purposefully. Consistent fever-dream texture biases details idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful lyric repetition ("unsettling calm," weaving motifs) taught early without obscuring. Minor paraphrase loops in transformation descriptions (e.g., eruption subsiding to forest) drag momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of illusion/memory-weaving transforms dream tropes into inevitable CR; sinew thread/gallery-mind premise risks bold surrealism heightening stakes organically.</comment>
