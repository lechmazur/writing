<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and intensifies through adaptive singing, aligning actions with whimsical traits; interiority concrete in humming from grandmother's tune. Limited contradictory impulses or embodied flaws reduce depth, but micro-choices like tinkering melodies reveal values under alignment pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hum to crescendo, culminating in on-page RR (arbor stirs, vines unfurl) with conceptual cost of ongoing sharing work. Single scene oriented early ("verdant arbor at dawn"); closure image of vine curling on wrist reconfigures legacy with felt purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details (emerald leaves, silver dew, hush) selective and purposeful, evolving with action ("limp vines stirred"); arbor constrains timing via dawn light and alignment. Recurring arbor charges final revitalized image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (arbor restoration) signaled early, tightens via alignment moment forcing crescendo commitment; agency in louder singing/adapting yields arbor response under accumulative lens. Visible cost in future sharing forecloses isolation, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of living traditions emerges from golden stories weaving rituals, resonant in final arbor glow and Elara's onward purpose without moralizing. Subtext in hush-to-rustles shift invites ambiguity on legacy endurance; particulars like vine reprise reweight renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (noticing glow, pulses); rhythmic modulation builds from hush to bird songs. Compression purposeful in story-weaving, legible under textural lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("golden stories," "sacred practices," "gathering hush") creates paraphrase loops and synonym churn across beats, dulling density; template cadence in descriptive runs ("restored balance," "renewed life"). Overwriting with stacked metaphors obscures propulsion in climax ("stories now depicted rituals").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer, vine-stories, and lunar alignment transforms restoration trope via song-mechanics; vine's evolution feels inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
