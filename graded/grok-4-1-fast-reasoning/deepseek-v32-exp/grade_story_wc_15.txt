<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving sewing from invisible thread to final stitch; attribute "hauntingly optimistic" fuels persistence through dark paths. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with interiority leaning abstract/poetic over embodied conflict. No deep flaws or blind spots complicating choices on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry/walking to central chamber sewing, culminating in RR closure as labyrinth awakens post-last stitch with felt effort cost. Orientation anchored early ("tide pools emptied...red canyon walls"). Single continuous scene fits defaults; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, damp hollows, glowing stone vividly constrain paths and charge restoration image; sensory details (post-tidal light, silvery thread) selective via dreamer's bias. Labyrinth evolves causally, breathing deeper at climax. Recurring plate as micro-setting guides stitches, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ruin to reverence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via navigation to chamber sewing with deepening density narrowing to knot/rubble; agency in deliberate stitches forecloses decay path. Cost legible in slow, physical labor yielding light/awakening. Mild static pressure without strong reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken precedents emerges organically from sewing over shattered paths, reweighting ruin via final light without moralizing. Orchid solace tone tensions optimism, charging closure image of restored spirit. Subtext in plate merging reality invites ambiguity on dream vs. reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (dreamer's certainty, sea/stone rhythms); voice texture poetic/rhythmic, modulating from wandering to chamber intensity. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens. Diction character-bound, avoiding leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short declarative stitches build to resonant awakening); density high but minor paraphrase loops ("overlapping sleepwalking paths," "hauntingly optimistic") in mid-section dull propulsion slightly. Figurative language consistent/lyric-motivated, no muddle at closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of labyrinth restoration via sewing sleepwalk paths transforms ruin trope; wharf weaver's dream-navigation feels organic/ingenious. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via plate's merge.</comment>
