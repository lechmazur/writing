<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation rooted in bleaching memory and paths investigation intensifies via data work; contradictory doubt/hope embodied in tapping and final stillness. Earned shift to purpose at "saved the report, their tapping finally stilled."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with data density building to CR closure; cost legible in "cleansing years of doubt and sorrow" at revelation beat. One tightening via anomaly correlation narrows loss to recovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station's sensors/console constrain assembly/tapping; sensory salt air/hum selective via biologist POV. Final "station hummed on... truly home" charges vigilance image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (paths discovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via data link to recovery; agency in assembly forecloses doubt path. Cost felt in emotional "weight of loss" reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from atlas/data/corals without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in mooring image reweights loss premise. Minor overtness in cycle repetitions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with tidal rhythmic texture; perceptual signature on marine data/tides. Modulates from measured tapping to surged understanding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in tapping/cycle phrasing dull revelation density; rhythm varies but some redundancy. Propulsion solid via integrated sensory action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh post-ban recovery via data paths/atlas benchmark transforms eco-loss trope; tapping quirk heightens personal stakes organically.</comment>
