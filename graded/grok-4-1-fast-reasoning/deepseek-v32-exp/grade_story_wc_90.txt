<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses vividly embodied in gravitational shifts during joy/hope moments force micro-choices like mental anchoring, earning the pacifist crossing at closure with integrated shadow cost. Interiority particular via light-strands perception and non-violent weaving. Pacifist trait compels all tactics without violence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of shimmer-stitching builds to pattern-break rippling/tearing with conceptual cost of leaving ship/shadows in final image. One tightening at zenith suffices; orientation anchored in opening paragraph. Closure DC/RR on-page via willed invitation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Milky quartz stone and faded photos constrain choices (focusing shimmer) and charge final floating image; ship's groan mirrors internal strain tactilely. Sensory hierarchy narrows to light/crackle in climax. Recurring tear-shimmers evolve causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension) tightens via density increase/resistance pressure, forcing empathetic stitching agency; joy buoyancy trade-off felt on-page twice. Escalation under Accumulative lens peaks in crackling air, foreclosing grim anchor path with spiritual cost legible in threshold step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate integration emerges organically from stitching sorrows into key, reweighting shadows via final golden silence/homecoming image without moralizing. Pacifist arc inextricable, countering conquest tropes. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases to empathetic light-strands; rhythmic modulation accelerates in stitching dance to weightless close. Voice texture distinct in "weave the shimmering trails" phrasing, lyric compression taught early and legible at tear-blazing closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands moving in a slow, deliberate dance, pulling at the strands of light"); varied rhythm propels to crackling climax. Minor figurative density in peak stitching risks overwrite (−0.3), but consistent weave/light pattern enhances without muddle. Zero loops/scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human pacifist gravity-trait with tear-shimmer metaphysics transforms tropes; risk-taking in accumulative stitching arc inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via joy-constraint without gimmick. Final weightless homecoming recharges premise boldly.</comment>
