<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to photograph the crater is consistent and intensifies via legacy thoughts, but interiority relies on labels like "purposefully curious" without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final endurance earned but lacks embodied conflict. Minor slips in epiphany phrasing like "felt the weight of their legacy" feel stock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via vials and hush to Charged Poise closure in shutter press and sand grain release; cost legible in "wave of dawnlit melancholy" and crater loss. Orientation anchored early at Mons Huygens; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lunar summit constrains vigil via cold, low gravity, suit hum, and terminator approach shaping timed waits; recurring crater and vials charge final image. Sensory details selective (shadows, iridescent grain) mirror melancholy without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing crater tightens accumulatively via vial color shifts narrowing time; agency in deliberate checks and shutter press forecloses pristine preservation with felt loss at dawn. One deepening sufficient; cost visible in erasure ahead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. time's flow emerges organically via crater, grain, and final sealing; resonant CR in grain "outlasting empires" reweights exploitation without moralizing. Particulars like vials avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in scientific noting ("exact shade, correlating"); rhythmic modulation builds hush, though minor convergence in repetitive melancholic phrasing. No head-hopping; elisions purposeful for vigil texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive exact phrases ("nightwatch’s hourglass sand grain" x4, "dawning hush" x3, "purposefully curious" x2) create paraphrase loops dulling propulsion in buildup beats; high density but template cadence in descriptive runs like vial shifts. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar sentinel legacy and corporate erasure via grain and vials transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric vigil heightens stakes organically. Final grain image feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
