<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to safeguard innovation clear and intensifies to compel escape room design, rooted in puzzle-designer traits; interiority concrete via orthogonal thinking. Internal conflict mild, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; change earned but low-stakes. Competent without blind spots or visible tradeoffs weakens depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed mystery to corporate link to room idea. Orientation anchored early (Elara by brook post-storm). Closure as CR: seed reconfigures from threat to cornerstone with felt business-protection cost in final integration image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: brook's murmur echoes thoughts, mossy stone/damp earth ground reflection. Micro-setting (brook, seed) charges final inspiration surge. Details selective via POV priorities, evolving with realization; recurring silence/hush mirrors internal hush of possibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed mystery tied to business threat) signaled early, deepens via corporate recall narrowing to innovation path. Agency in decision to design room forecloses threat path with felt cost. Accumulative escalation coherent, one tightening sufficient; abstract stakes viscerally felt in clutched seed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of innovation/rebirth emerges organically from seed's transformation via particulars (corpse flower rarity, orthogonal puzzles). Final image reconfigures mystery to sanctuary without moralizing. Resonance from constraint-hidden potential; lingering ambiguity in sender's intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: puzzle metaphors (orthogonal approaches, brook flow). Prose texture rhythmic, modulating from contemplative hush to inspired surge. No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled, perceptual bias via receptive trait.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm supports momentum; sentences advance reflection/atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loops in reflections ("possibility just born," "hush") and repetitive stems dull some propulsion. No heavy artifacts touching closure; clean grammar, purposeful telling for summary end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: corpse flower seed as escape room pivot transforms mystery trope organically. Non-obvious angle on innovation under threat; risk in tying foul-bloom rarity to creativity payoff feels inevitable. Memorable via brook/seed interplay charging closure.</comment>
