<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies credibly to compel the tuning shift, rooted in quest for cosmic cycles; interiority particular via celestial bias. Earned change via shard placement forecloses old methods with felt perceptual cost. Minor slip: emotions more summarized than embodied in "smiled, her practical task complete."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from static to tone via shard and attenuation. CR closure legible in "pure tone" revealing silence-as-canvas, with cost of discarded assumptions reweighting perception. One tightening via method shift suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tower grating and gorge constrain ascent/descent, charging final "cradle" image that mirrors insight. Sensory selection (creaking, humming) POV-filtered by interpreter's priorities, vivid and purposeful. No white-room; evolves with moon's pull.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (elusive signal) signaled early, tightens via agency in placing shard and attenuating—foreclosing amplification path. Accumulative escalation reweights via deepening realization; cost felt in "years of training...failed." Charges poise in descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of endings-as-beginnings emerges organically from silence-tone pivot, resonant in final gorge image without moral. Subtext in shard's "active void" enriches complexity. Over-articulation in closing lines ("perpetual rebirth...new dawn") borders redundancy, diluting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature: cosmic whispers filter all notice. Voice texture distinct in rhythmic swells ("serenely electric"), modulates to grounded close. No head-hopping; compression purposeful in tuning beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("every ending...beginning," "silence...hush") in final third dull closure image, with synonym churn on insight. Rhythm varies but template cadence in repetitive stems ("She..."). Density high early, scaffolds late; no grammar issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: meteoric "hollywood star" as key to hush-shard signal transforms post-collapse tropes into fantasy practicality. Bold CR turn inevitable from particulars; no derivative hedging.</comment>
