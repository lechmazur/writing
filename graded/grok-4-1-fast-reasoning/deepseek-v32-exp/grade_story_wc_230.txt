<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rational traits drive risk calculation and ritual choice, with embodied desperation in "cold and heavy in her palm"; earned change at "wave of static silence" forecloses isolation path. Minor telling in "mind, once a fortress" dilutes peak embodiment. Contradictory impulses (logic vs curse) act in cradle-fashioning beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to ritual RR (Charged Poise in "fragile wall") with conceptual cost "temporary... unknown" legible in final reflection. Single scene fits defaults; orientation anchored by orchard/ravine para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm/orchard constrain charging ritual ("slick paths," lightning "searing bolt") and charge final image ("roots deep in the stone"); sensory hierarchy (truffle scent, lashing rain) biases rationally. Mirrors resilience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (occlude truth) signaled early, tightens via storm-peak ritual agency narrowing to "desperate goal"; cost felt in temporary occlusion. Accumulative density reweights without opposition slippage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resilient grace emerges via orchard/truth interplay, final image ("edged with hard-won tranquility") non-literally reanswers safety question. No moralizing; ambiguity in "cost... unknown" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with rational perceptual signature (logic calculations, earthy scents); rhythmic modulation peaks at ritual "hum with inner light." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "truth compulsion," "fractured grace" (3x in final third), and orchard resilience dull closure image; synonym churn ("occlude/block/mute") −1.0 total. Ritual beat clean, but reflection density drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of virus-truth curse, relic ritual, truffle-forager resilience transforms isolation trope; risk in storm-charge heightens stakes organically.</comment>
