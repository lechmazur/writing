<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Trait labels like "infinitely patient" and "motivation was pure" dominate over embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no simultaneous impulses in pivotal striking moment weakens earning of closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hum to shimmer to symphony; on-page DC closure ("Shadows shifted, forming into figures") legible with felt world-cost, but subtle personal constraint lacks sharp tactical shape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain pacing choices and charge final pulse; sensory hierarchy (hums, scuffs, whispers) selective via Elian's tuner bias integrates vividly without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant revival stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via one decisive density shift (chord ripple forces town reconfiguration); agency in strikes narrows to Charged Poise closure with ongoing-duty cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Balance theme emerges organically from rhythm motifs shifting to symphony without statement; final archway/child's laugh reconfigures loss-to-hope without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic syntax matching stakes; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legible at revival without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "rhythm/footsteps/balance" stems and paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple pacing descriptions) create template cadence across middle beats, dulling propulsion despite varied openings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tuner reviving ghost town via footsteps transforms tropes through specific vibrational logic; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
