<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve echoes intensifies through conjuring and consecration, rooted in strangely honest traits that compel selfless limits. Interiority concrete in peripheral awareness and peace reveal, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal consecration beat. Change to quiet stewardship earned with felt cost of ongoing watch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fading murmurs to sustained harmony. Closure as Charged Poise in "echoes resonated... living legacy," reconfiguring preservation with conceptual cost of eternal stewardship. One tightening via parapet emergence narrows to successful consecration; orientation anchored early in pavilion post-prophet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Murmuring pavilion and kinetic parapet vividly constrain choices—Kael approaches stone, feels rhythms guiding consecration. Sensory whispers/vibrations selective through peripheral awareness bias. Parapet reprise charges final harmony image, evolving causally from dunes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve dissolving echoes) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via conjuring/parapet rise forcing consecration agency. Cost legible in "admission of limitations" during dedication, altering to endless tending. Coherent pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of honest preservation emerges organically from clearings/consecration mirroring Kael's traits. Final image of "living, breathing legacy" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting echoes as world-shaping force without moralizing. Complexity in self-knowledge cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in peripheral awareness filtering. Prose texture poetic but some diction repetition strains under pressure. No head-hopping; elision of prophet off-page purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("through peripheral awareness" x6, "strangely honest" x3) creates template cadence and paraphrase loops, dulling density in consecration beat. Synonym churn (murmurs/whispers/echoes) across adjacent lines obscures propulsion. Rhythm varies but overwriting in summary ending ("echo... preserved... endured") drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy synthesis of line-walker, parapet, clearings feels organic and fresh, transforming preservation trope via peripheral mechanics. Risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens conceptual stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
