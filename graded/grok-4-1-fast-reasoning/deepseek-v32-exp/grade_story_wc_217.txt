<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to find beauty in fragments intensifies credibly through kite and child, with embodied attention via feather handling; minor slip in minimal shown contradictory impulses during child interaction, as serenity dominates without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from poetic observations to CR closure in final image of "complete in its incompleteness," with felt cost of embracing fragments over wholeness legible in poet's writing and child's renewed kite; kite snap inciting beat tightens density coherently; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "light caught on ripples" and wet sand filter through poet's perceptual bias, with drake's feather as micro-setting constraining interaction and charging final desk image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering beauty in incomplete signaled early and deepens accumulatively via kite snap to child-sharing beat; child's tears provide visible cost easing into charged poise, but pressure remains gentle without sharp option-narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incomplete emerges organically from feather-kite images shifting to shared realization; resonant final line reweights premise without moralizing, though poet's spoken "broken things hold the most beauty" borders echo, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature in phrases like "harmonizing discord" sustains rhythmic control; stable close third-person POV with natural, subtextual dialogue advances child moment without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in "harmonizing discord" and "burnished hush" repetitions dull ~2% of texture without touching closure; figurative language coherent in peak child beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle transforms kite-loss trope into poetic harmonizing with feather-child synthesis; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
