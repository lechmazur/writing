<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via visions of failures, earning change in "he had harvested insights from failure"; embodied emotions limited to thoughts, with tidy epiphany "failure is not an end, but a beginning" feeling unearned without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of world-shards builds patterns to CR closure ("Failure had been his teacher") with felt cost in remaking; markers ensure causal return, orientation anchored early in thunder-echo range.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driftwood and canyon constrain choices (markers for return) and charge final image ("driftwood markers stood as silent sentinels"); "avalanchingly quiet" hush filters perception purposefully, selective sensory focus on silence amplifies stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (insights from failure) signaled early, escalates via shard-deepening under Accumulative lens to stance crystallization; agency in flute-playing and observation forecloses ignorance with felt growth cost at return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of failure-as-teacher emerges organically from visions to resonant CR ("weaving between worlds had shown him that failure is not an end"); final image reweights premise without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in "hard-won wisdom."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in silence-obsessed noticing ("canyon hush deepened"); rhythmic prose modulates from heavy to "full of potential," distinct texture in weaving diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("canyon hush," "avalanchingly quiet," "harvest insights") creates minor template cadence across opening/mid, dulling some propulsion; high density overall, but synonym loops like "profound hush/silence" trigger -0.4.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of portal introspection via flute/markers transforms failure trope; risk in multi-realm observation heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight in "remade" closure.</comment>
