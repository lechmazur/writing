<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via embodied "snowmelt ardor" during rewiring, with earned change in deeper peace; weakness in lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses during pivotal untwisting of stiff rope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from hum to chorus; on-page RR closure via light burst merging card to rope reconfigures silence to voice, cost legible in crumbling scrap and yielded frigidity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora and ice constrain gentle braiding of stiff rope while charging final dripping walls and glowing lattice image; sensory hierarchy vivid through caster's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens via sound deepening to names under accumulative lens, driven by her agency; minor slip in abstract opposition leaves cost more conceptual than viscerally foreclosing options at card press.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral-to-eternal emerges organically via casting analogy and rope lattice; final image of resonant names offers non-literal answer reweighting loss without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in caster's precise noticing of braids and perforations; rhythmic modulation heightens reverence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action, but repeated "snowmelt ardor" (3x) and "technically gentle" create minor paraphrase loop dulling reflective beats before climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax casting, organ card, and rope braids for sound preservation transforms memory trope organically; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at glowing monument.</comment>
