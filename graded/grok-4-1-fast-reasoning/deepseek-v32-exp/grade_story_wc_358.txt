<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in survey actions, with embodied jolt from patch discovery revealing character under pressure; micro-choices like tucking patch show values hierarchy. Interiority concrete but slips into abstract epiphanies like "singular convergence" without full contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance of vigilance earned but lacks deeper flaw-complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wind readings to patch find to site reconstruction, tightening toward CR closure where silence reconfigures as "full of unspoken warnings" with conceptual vigilance cost. Orientation anchored early in port maze post-disaster. One meaningful deepening at crash site image sharpens hypotheses without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers constrain survey path and funnel wind, charging final reconstruction image; sensory wind "howling through a narrow gap" mirrors internal pressures selectively via investigator bias. Details tactile and evolve causally, avoiding generics. Environment shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of foresight signaled early; accumulative escalation via deepening knowledge from anemometer data to patch to dreadful crash visualization forecloses oversight option with felt cost in "cascaded into oblivion." Agency in persistent survey amid wind pressure coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of convergence emerges organically from wind patterns, patch, and reconstruction, reweighted in final image of "storm of prevention brewing" without moralizing. Patch reprise shifts from relic to vigilance symbol, embracing complexity of perception gaps. Resonant non-literal answer to foresight question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing ("invisible maps of turbulence"); voice texture modulates from hazy to sharpened rhythm matching pressure. Diction purposeful, syntax reflects analytical mind without leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in repeated "wind shifted" and "adapting" phrasing dull mid-beats; figurative consistency like "metallic sighs" purposeful. No closure artifacts; strong propulsion to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation crash probe via container wind dynamics and patch token transforms investigation trope; risk in lyric accumulative texture heightens insight stakes organically. Non-obvious port maze as chaotic force memorable.</comment>
