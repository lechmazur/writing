<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to coax resilience shown through consistent mining and forging actions; meekness masking defiance earns change without deep contradiction. Label-heavy traits like "quietly determined" reduce particularity, but micro-choices under pressure align.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from discovery to thriving planet; CR closure in final forge image reweights rubble-to-strength with persistent effort cost. Summary jumps dilute because/therefore linkages, but one tightening at barter suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating arches and mines integrate selectively, supplying rubble and mirroring resolve; "arches seemed to hum in sympathy" charges process. Sensory bias (echoing steps, starlight silk) reflects priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resilience tightens accumulatively via barter and forging success, narrowing from confusion to clarity with patience cost. "Process was slow, requiring patience" makes price legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of bartered resilience emerges organically from particulars like silk trade and shared methods; final "forge glowed... beacon" offers non-literal resonance reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in deliberate noticing; mage dialogue natural and goal-driven. Rhythmic modulation supports texture, minor exposition in interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("quietly determined," "deliberate," "coax resilience from rubble") across multiple beats dull density; template cadence in repetitive strikes/echoes triggers −1.0. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes transformed via planet's arches/mines and silk barter into fresh resilience synthesis; "azure defiance" inflects quietly without gimmick.</comment>
