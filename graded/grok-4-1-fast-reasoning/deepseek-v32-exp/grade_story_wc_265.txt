<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sixth sense and gear's familiarity drives consistent micro-choices like interpreting wind sounds; embodied hum in bones grounds interiority. No on-page internal contradiction acting simultaneously weakens 9+ test, though endurance of translocations earns change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from wind tones to deafening hum culminating in CR ("mind unfolded... cascade of probable miracles") with legible conceptual cost of reconfigured translocations. Two shards taught via sleep pattern; orientation anchored early in first clearing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest details like brass trees and mercury waterfall constrain choices (gear spins toward path, wind harmonics guide); recurring gear charges final machine slot. Sensory hierarchy (hum felt in bones) reflects philosopher's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mind's frontier) signaled early tightens via hum intensification and jammed machine under accumulative lens; agency in gear placement forecloses disruption path with felt acceptance cost. One decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical harmony unlocking consciousness emerges organically from wind language and machine song; final "she joined its song" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting miracles without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (vibrations into bones, resonant gong awakening) stable with rhythmic modulation; purposeful compression in translocation elisions taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "brushing rust-colored pollen... small gear" advances setting/character); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical rainforest as mind metaphor with wind-as-language transforms quest trope; risk in translocation pattern heightens stakes, inevitable at gear-fit climax.</comment>
