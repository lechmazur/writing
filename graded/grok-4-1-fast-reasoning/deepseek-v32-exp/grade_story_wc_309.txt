<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to find sacred simplicity roots choices consistently and compels the keystone use, earning the final embrace of change; interiority concrete in mist walking urge. Internal conflict emerges mildly in underachieving isolation versus inspiration, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal discovery beat. Embodied emotion shows in kneeling at flower, but progression feels slightly tidy without deeper hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/mist images builds to RR closure in spire transformation with felt cost of shedding cloak/doubt. Orientation anchors Elian/spire early; keystone discovery motivates journey ellipsis coherently. Inciting loose stone and climax flower realization link via pattern without breaks; cost legible in "unstrapping the bonds of doubt."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound spire and mists constrain mist walking and guide via lingering luminance, charging final image of transformed walls/vines. Sensory hierarchy (weak sun through ice, frost-kissed clearing) reflects mage priorities, integrated into action. Pivotal journey moment sharpened by "treacherous" expanse mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred simplicity vs. automation) signaled early, tightens via keystone-enhanced mist walking under Accumulative lens, narrowing to flower realization. Agency in focusing will and placing keystone forecloses underachieving path with visible cost (cloak fall, spire shift). No live reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred simplicity emerges organically from keystone/flower particulars, reweighting automation premise in final spire beacon image without moralizing. Subtext in light motifs shifts from haunting to testament, inviting ambiguity on creativity's cost. Climax realization avoids platitude via embodied kneeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/mist bias; voice texture poetic yet consistent, modulating to inspiration at "newfound purpose ignite." No dialogue; diction purposeful, syntax reflects contemplative state. Elevated register fits mage idiom without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short contemplative breaths to journey propulsion); density high, but "lingering luminance" loops (4+ recurrences) create minor paraphrase churn dulling mid-journey beat. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; strong verbs propel. Closure image clear despite repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated creativity vs. mist-walking simplicity, transformed via keystone's impossibility-bending in ice spire. Risky poetic frame heightens thematic stakes organically; no template echoes, core premise commits fully to rejection arc.</comment>
