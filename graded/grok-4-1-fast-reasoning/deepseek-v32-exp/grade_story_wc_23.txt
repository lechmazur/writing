<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's embodied handling of the censer foot and building micro-choices reveal contradictory impulses to flee or confront loss, earning the final endurance; abstract "geography of loss" phrasing slightly dilutes interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as building density culminates in CR closure—"voice had been her own all along"—repricing external guidance as internal with legible emotional cost of pain acceptance; orientation anchored early, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Censer foot as micro-setting constrains alignment with Polaris and charges final pulsing image; starlit station and lunar visuals selectively mirror grief shift without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating loss signaled early via stranding, escalates accumulatively through phone-guided building and hum resonance narrowing to self-listening; agency in resonator construction forecloses escape path with acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of confronting loss emerges organically via reverse migration particulars, final self-voice realization resonantly reweights premise without moralizing; lingering ambiguity in solace avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice delivers distinct cosmic-perceptual signature ("pull the stars closer"), rhythmic modulation heightens building intensity; stable close-third POV with no leakage, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with motif repetitions ("raw solace," "geography of loss") purposefully accumulating texture under lens; minor spaced paraphrase loops avoid adjacent redundancy but slightly slow propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spiritual sci-fi via censer-powered memory archaeology transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens internal stakes organically.</comment>
