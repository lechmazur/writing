<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in dreams compels climb and touch of starlight, earning shift from disenchantment to guardianship with felt weight. Interiority embodied in "fear that gnawed" and eased shoulders, but revelation epiphany ("she was not just a queen") borders unearned. Contradictory impulses show in defiance amid arduous steps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dreams/climb to grotto vision as CR closure, reweighting duty with "weight of revelation settling." Orientation anchored early (balcony, palace, ridge). No debt; fireflies reprise charges final descent image with cost (winking out).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (thin air, swirling clouds, silver rivulets pooling) constrain climb and charge vision; cobalt walls and ember pulse mirror internal shift. Fireflies as micro-setting ease tension then dim, recharging closure. POV bias filters through queen's disenchantment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via arduous climb/guardian moment to vision deepening cosmic tie to kingdom. Agency in reaching/touching substance forecloses ignorance with conceptual cost legible in "fragile truth." One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of celestial sorrow balancing duty emerges organically from starlight vision and fireflies dimming, reweighting disenchantment without statement. Final image (descent with purpose, lacy menace woven) offers resonant CR answer. Subtext in guardian nod and voice whisper adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (royal detachment to cosmic witness). Prose texture modulates rhythm in climb ("each step a defiance") to vision hum. Minimal dialogue natural; voice consistent, poetic without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere, rhythm varies (short vision flashes vs. flowing descent). Minor overwrite in "lacy menace" metaphor at climax slightly muddles; no loops, but repetitive firefly motifs borderline template. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-quest with bleeding starlight cosmos and fireflies dimming transforms trope into cosmic duty warning. Risk in lacy menace tone heightens menace without gimmick. Specifics (cobalt/ember grottos) feel organic, inevitable at revelation.</comment>
