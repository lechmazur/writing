<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kaelen's wryly earnest demeanor and motivation to thresh meaning drive consistent micro-choices, culminating in the exchange that earns his shift from isolation to fragile connection. Interiority embodied in "heart ached with haggard awe" at artifacts avoids stock phrasing. Minor slip: epiphany at return feels slightly over-tidy without deeper contradictory impulse in the final painting beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain trek accumulates discoveries to unearthed artifacts, Elara's emergence, and exchange tightening to CR closure where new painting reconfigures insomnia with amber-infused understanding and felt cost of prior solitude. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. One meaningful deepening at convergence suffices; no causality breaks touch pivotal discovery/exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details like "slick rocks... boots squelching in the mud" selectively guide choices via rain trails to interior exposure. Tidal island post-wars evolves from isolation to sanctuary, mirroring internal shift; amber brooch as micro-setting charges final image. POV bias filters through painterly perception without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via artifact convergence and Elara encounter forcing exchange trade-off that forecloses isolation with fragile peace cost. Agency in trekking and agreeing narrows options; one tightening at "He knew he couldn't leave the brooch behind" suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilient connection in desolation emerges organically from convergence artifacts, exchange, and final painting image reweighting loss without moralizing. Subtext in Elara's "tiny beacon" implies hope's fragility; earned resonance avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with painterly perceptual signature ("tracing the shapes of dried riverbeds"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("We don't get many visitors here") distinguishes voices idiomatically. Rhythm modulates from wry earnestness to charged poise at close. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("rain trails" thrice, "thresh meaning" repeated) and synonym churn ("haggard awe" twice) dull two beats without pattern payoff, dragging momentum pre-exchange. No artifacts obscure closure image; rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-water wars painter following rain trails to artifact convergence transforms isolation trope via tactile, textural discoveries. Risk in quiet CR epiphany heightens stakes organically; no derivative templates.</comment>
