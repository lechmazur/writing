<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve trust drives inventive revision under anxiety, embodied in heart pounding and buckle-tightening; contradictory fear/instinct acts in muscle-memory inputs. Minor diagnostic slips like "attentively inventive" slightly abstract traits, but micro-choices like hybrid analysis earn her shift to pride.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static vacuum builds to anomalous data tightening pressure, resolved in coherent pattern discovery and transmission as Charged Poise CR. Orientation anchors Elara/arbor early; cost legible in solitude amplified then reconfigured in final arbor image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor's vines/winds constrain cable-securing choice; parachute buckle as micro-setting charges final glinting image, mirroring resolve. Sensory hierarchy (cold metal, starlight, bioluminescence) filters through pattern-seeker's bias, evolving from prison to watchtower without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (accurate interpretation to preserve trust) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via anomalous patterns forcing hybrid revision that narrows failure risk. Agency in muscle-memory inputs and buckle-securing forecloses doubt with felt anxiety cost; single deepening suffices, charging discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of burden-as-hope emerges organically from buckle adaptation, echo reconfiguration, and arbor shift, with final image resonating non-literally on vigilance's cost. Subtext in solitude/desolation tension avoids moralizing; counter-reading (ongoing isolation) lingers via reweighted particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pattern/resonance noticing; voice modulates lyrically from "cacophony" anxiety to "canvas" poise. Rhythmic diction (danced fingers, glinting symbol) sustains texture under stress; purposeful repetition taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (buckle secures cables/steadies nerves); rhythm varies for propulsion. −0.6 for paraphrase loops on "burden"/"echo" and minor template stems in revision beats, though pattern-taught motif mitigates; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of isolated watcher motif via data-cables/buckle ingenuity transforms trope; celestial reveal grows inevitably from muscle-memory tactics. Risky lyric arbor/evolving symbol heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
