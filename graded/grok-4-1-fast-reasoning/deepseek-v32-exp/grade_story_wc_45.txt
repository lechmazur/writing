<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's forgiving skepticism drives concrete micro-choices like gathering herbs and the ritual, earning her change with the felt cost of lost simplicity. Internal conflict layers doubt and purpose effectively until the tooth's dissolution. Some epiphanic summaries like "new understanding began to rise" slightly dilute embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflections densify to ritual's pattern break, landing CR closure in tooth dissolving to fireflies, reweighting deception as guidance with legible conceptual cost ("weight of her journey lift"). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early via garden and tooth. One tightening via purpose-sharpened resolve suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden and maze constrain isolation for ritual, with moss stone and earth charging final pressing act; scents and twilight flowers mirror internal shift tactilely. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's nostalgia (herbs evoking memories). Recurrent earth/soil evolves to receive tooth, recharging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (mend certainty post-deception) signaled early, accumulates density to ritual tightening that forecloses grief via agency. Cost unmistakable in tooth's dissolution and past foregone. Lens-compliant cadence shift reweights to possibilities ahead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss emerges organically from ritual and firefly image answering certainty's rift without statement. Fireflies reprise mistakes as stars resonantly. Borderline echo in final line "forgiveness was the greatest innovation" nudges from higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (patterns, stars in errors); diction modulates lyrically from doubt to clarity. Rhythmic control heightens ritual's shimmer. No dialogue; voice distinct without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density but −0.9 for paraphrase loops ("cleft"/"chasm," "yearn"/"yearning," "mistakes/constellations") and synonym churn across reflective beats, dulling propulsion. Dense metaphors coherent yet overpacked in climax ("constellation of fireflies"). Rhythm varies but template echoes in openings ("She...").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fae trope transformed via bone-setting ritual and tooth-to-fireflies CR, synthesizing nostalgia with innovation organically. Constellation motif inevitable in hindsight from motivation. Bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
