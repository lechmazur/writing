<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prism-mind trait drives consistent motivation and success, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; past failure feels diagnostic summary rather than embodied conflict influencing a micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure (absorption reconfigures self as guardian) and legible cost in transformation; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inverted gravity and mist constrain choices (e.g., boots on stalactites) and charge final image via parting mist; sensory details selective and POV-filtered through archivist priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens via threshold intensification forcing vigilance endurance; agency in crossing archway forecloses failure path with felt sensory cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vigilance theme emerges organically from combinations/seed patterns, resonating in final guardian reconfiguration without moralizing; final image reweights prism-mind premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable POV with perceptual signature (layer-seeing refracted truths); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, diction purposeful and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "clandestinely luminous," "seeds of vigilance") and template phrasing in reflective beats dull peak momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted physics, living patterns, and archivist vigilance transforms quest trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR closure.</comment>
