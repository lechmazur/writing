<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in tingling scars and micro-choice to gesture invitation at pivotal connection beat, earning mutual lesson; minor slips in abstract "teach suffocating to breathe" repetition without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from solitude to shared breathing; on-page Charged Poise closure in final dawn image reconfigures isolation with legible cost of pierced silence; orientation anchored early in sanctuary details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory integration like charcoal-dusted ground and starlit silhouettes mirrors internal blurring, constraining invitation to sit in dust; charges final ashen haven image without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of solitude vs. connection signaled early tightens accumulatively through scar resonance to invitation, narrowing options with agency in hovering hand and gesture; cost felt in expanded sanctuary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of breathing through scars emerges organically from images like burned bridges and loaded emptiness shifting to potential; resonant non-literal close in shared rhythm avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature in shadow-tending bias; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative build, single spoken line natural and goal-pursuing without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs but minor paraphrase loops in "burned bridges" and figurative density border overwriting in mid-build; high density overall propels to clean final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-keeping solitude pierced via scars transforms isolation trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
