<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in meticulous actions like lifting the slide carefully; embodied emotion in "heart ached, but he focused" shows restraint under pressure. Limited internal contradiction or flaws; competence dominates without genuine struggle or micro-choices revealing value hierarchy beyond task endurance. Final endurance earned but lacks deeper cost tied to personal flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through successive samplings, pattern discovery, and pace quickening as slide dims. Orientation anchored early ("frozen library above the clouds," Elian as records chief). Closure as CR in final storage and "meaning endured, etched into the records," with felt cost of fading vows legible in "encroaching void" and library sigh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (quartz hush, crackle of ice, mist) filter through Elian's reverent priorities, mirroring internal ache. Environment constrains: cold "seeps into bones," forces steady hand; recurring plinth/slide charges final image of storage. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent throughout single scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vows' meaning before oblivion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via discoveries (pattern, queen's vow hope) narrowing to data extraction as slide dims. Agency in sampling forecloses loss path with visible cost (draining power, quickened pace). Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient; cost unmistakable in final "honoring its passage."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of enduring meaning from decay emerges organically via vow projections shifting from betrayal to pure protection, culminating in resonant CR: "measured not just light, but the weight of promises." No moralizing; ambiguity in "sliver of hope" lingers without confusion. Final image reweights premise without literal statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: meticulous, reverent noticing (e.g., "fragile volume with reverence"). Voice texture distinct in poetic rhythm modulating to urgency ("quickened his pace"); no head-hopping or withholding. Prose reflects mind under fading pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("gently meticulous," "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion," "while illusions fade to memory") create paraphrase churn across beats, dulling density; synonym cycles (fading/dimming/dissolving) in high-pressure sampling. Template cadence in sequential actions ("He lifted... slotted... A beam erupted"). Artifacts pervade final third, obscuring propulsion at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: luminous vows as measurable frequencies in cloud library transforms preservation trope via specific projections revealing history. Risk in poetic fantasy frame heightens stakes without gimmick; final reconfiguration ("meaning endured") inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
