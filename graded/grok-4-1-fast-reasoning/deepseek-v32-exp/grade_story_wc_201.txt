<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied trauma responses and mathematical motivation create contradictory impulses peaking in the strap's settling certainty, earning the final realization without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing at the strap discovery; cost legible in shift from panic waves to cold realization, reconfiguring mercy's premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest and stream constrain perception/actions (light burns, twig snaps trigger); final upward gaze charges image with judgment-to-rooted shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of mercy) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (bracing rituals to strap find) narrowing panic options; protagonist endurance forecloses shattered-mind path with felt certainty cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from trauma particulars to resonant CR: mercy as cycle interruption reweights pain/grace without moralizing, final strap palm crystallizing non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with trauma-biased perceptual signature (proprioceptive mapping, phantom strap); rhythmic modulation under stress maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor purposeful repetition of "brace" risks loop in mid-beats; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive trauma, UV penance, and mercy equation transforms tropes; strap-to-realization turn inevitable from forest particulars.</comment>
