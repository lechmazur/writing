<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in copyist diligence drives progression from listening to embedding codes in scores, with micro-choices like whispering to dust earning the final endurance. Interiority embodied via pulse quickening and dust wonder, but internal conflict remains subtle without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final kinship surge with broadcaster acknowledgment feels earned, foreclosing safer isolation with risk cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly density builds from tuning radio to dust retaining tales, tightening via dust crown formation and broadcaster nod ("To the listener in the mist"). Orientation anchored early (Elara in alcove post-famine). Closure as Charged Poise/CR in alcove "breathing with whispered legends," reconfiguring famine premise with isolation cost legible in "threat of exposure loomed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, fading coals, and dust motes vividly constrain secrecy and enable rebellion, filtering through copyist's pattern-noticing bias. Recurring radio glow and dust constrain choices (hidden beacon) and charge final image of glowing dust retaining tales. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under risk: glow guides, dust swirls responsively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive stories via dust amid authorities) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through decoding, embedding codes, and dust crown/response, narrowing options with exposure risk. Agency in transcribing/whispering forces trade-offs; broadcaster acknowledgment deepens pressure. Cost legible in "perilous endeavor" and looming threat, charging final sanctuary poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories lingering in mundane emerges organically via lyrics-to-dust progression, resisting tidy morals with famine persistence outside alcove. Final image ("narratives flourished once more") offers resonant CR repricing revival premise without statement, deepened by cloaking motif shifting from broadcast to her scores.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature: copyist's precision notices patterns in lyrics/dust ("puzzle... unearthing buried treasures"). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity (short sentences in wonder beats), purposeful compression taught early via misty alcove elisions paid in glowing sanctuary. No dialogue; voice distinct and biased to musical subversion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/insight jobs, rhythm varies (long misted descriptions breathe into crisp dust responses). Minor paraphrase loops ("secret glow," "thistled calm" reprise purposeful but borders redundancy); no closure touch. Zero major artifacts, metaphors coherent (dust crown mirrors fallen king).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: story famine + dust-as-narrator + lyric codes transforms copyist rebellion into inevitable CR, with dust crown turn grown from prior patterns. Risk in embedding scores heightens stakes organically; no derivative templates, voice commits to thistled calm ingenuity.</comment>
