<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in obsession driving meditation despite chill; embodied in fingers tracing booklet and ignored weariness. Interiority concrete via pebble-shore recall anchoring present work, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—no deep internal struggle complicates the smooth process. Mild obsession feels slightly label-driven rather than fully complicating choices with visible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of summarized silences (fort history, ridge, sky) builds to booklet glowing and map complete as Charged Poise/CR closure. Orientation anchored early in oracle, fort, dimming sky with one star. One tightening via patterns emerging reweights endless night; cost legible in flaking gold impermanence at "gold leaf flaked onto her fingers."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hush (whispering robes, howling winds' aftermath, chill air) integrated into action; fort stones constrain by providing battlement canvas. Recurring star pulses/agrees/dims/brighter charges final image, mirroring internal progress. Selective POV filter via silence-attunement elevates; body (weariness, fingers) as micro-setting shapes endurance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (draw map via silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening silences distilled into symbols, narrowing to glowing pages. Agency in focused meditation forecloses weariness path with felt cost (bones' weariness ignored). Pressure coherent but low-key—no sharp reversal; chill as minor complication suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence mapping void emerges organically from particulars (pebble-shore rhythm to fort hush); final image of filled booklet and brighter star offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in impermanence (flaking gold) enriches comfort-in-darkness. No tidy resolution—ambiguity lingers in spiritual map's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature attuned to silences/patterns; voice lyrical, modulating rhythm to meditative hush (e.g., "marbled hush deepened"). Diction purposeful, syntax reflects contemplative state. Minor repetition in hush-phrasing reads as intentional pattern rather than leak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("summarizing silence," "ambered/marble hush" variants across beats) create paraphrase churn, dulling propulsion in core meditation sequence. Dense figuratives ("air thick with unspoken histories," "textured quality, like veined stone") overload without payoff in peak. Rhythm varies but template cadence in process description ("She retold the silence of...") drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope into silence-as-cartography transforms mystic premise organically. Bold lyric accumulative structure risks static process but pays off in map's spiritual reconfiguration. Specifics like flaking booklet avoid generic fantasy; no close echoes, feels authentic vision.</comment>
