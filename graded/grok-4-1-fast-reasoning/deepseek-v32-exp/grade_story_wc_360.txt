<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds transposed empathy density through printing beats, tightening to halo-induced CR closure where "profound and quiet clarity" reweights quest with "cost of her quest" legible in drawer placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Topaz dome and vanishing stars constrain liminal timing for printing choices, evolving to charge final image of "memory of their light etched in the topaz" mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
