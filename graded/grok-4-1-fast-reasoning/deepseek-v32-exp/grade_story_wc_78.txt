<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to transform obstacles is clear and drives all actions consistently; micro-choices with mallet and dubbing reveal values effectively. Limited interior contradiction or embodied emotional layering weakens depth, with emotions more performed than simultaneous impulses in pivotal strikes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-building from single note to symphony; Charged Poise closure in final image ("work never done") reconfigures ongoing stakes with legible conceptual cost of eternal vigilance. Orientation anchored early; one tightening at wave fractalizes threat seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating orchard and resonator constrain choices (fragile vs. wave) and charge final beacon image; sensory hierarchy (visual blue hour, tactile deck shift, auditory cascades) filtered through prophet's resonant priorities. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform silence/wave via resonance) signaled early; accumulative escalation deepens via dubbed layers to wave climax, narrowing to full-strength strike with panting cost. Agency in strikes/dubs forecloses passive drift, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of obstacle-to-instrument emerges organically from fractal transformations; final euphony image reweights premise with restless cost, inviting ambiguity on endless purpose without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like droplet carillon avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in musical/resonant noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from calm arcing to urgent strike without head-hopping. Lyrical compression taught early fits accumulative lens, paying off in harmonious closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency (short strikes at climax); high density integrates action/image without loops, though occasional figurative density borders overwriting in early descriptions. Propulsion clear, no scaffolds dulling wave beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic prophecy, fractal orchard, and wave harmony transforms survival tropes; risk in poetic accumulative structure heightens stakes, with sea's inevitability constraining closure organically. Non-obvious premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
