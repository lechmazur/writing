<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in diligent adjustments tied to past flood guilt, with embodied reverie during pauses; internal conflict shows via trembling hands yielding to surety. Earned change in self-forgiveness feels credible via incremental fixes. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphanies like "profound clarity began to emerge," bordering on unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hitch to adjustments to realization, with closure as Conceptual Repricing in final image of "man reborn through tiny acts," cost legible in guilt's release ("weight of the world lifted"). Orientation anchored early (Elias on ridge, tower). One tightening via inscriptions guiding bob adjustment narrows to acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: waves "groaned," pendulum "hitch" and "arc grew smoother" constrain choices, charging final balcony view of "moonlit waves recede." Micro-settings like workbench tools and bob evolve causally. Obsidian ridge mirrors internal shift from regret shroud to serene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance/absolution) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening reverie and smoother swing reweighting guilt. Agency in micro-adjustments forecloses shortcut path with ethical cost. Felt price in past "screams swallowed by the sea" ties to present clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges organically from repetitive fixes and softening reverie, resonating in final "tiny acts" image reweighting past failure. Subtext in rake handle as heritage bridge avoids direct statement. Minor friction from repetitive phrasing like "incremental absolution" nearing echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in clock pauses and tactile adjustments; voice texture modulates from guilt-trembling to calm surety. Rhythmic phrasing like "tick-tock echoing like a steady heartbeat" purposeful. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops dominate: "incremental absolution" (5+ times), "ethically diligent" (3x), "searing reverie" (3x), "pause in pendulum's swing" (4x), "tidal obsidian ridge" (6x) create paraphrase churn and template cadence, dulling propulsion in reflective beats. Some vivid images like "pendulum bob a gleaming orb," but density drags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwinder redemption via rake inscriptions on obsidian ridge transforms trope through specific heritage logic and micro-pauses. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in quiet CR closure. No close famous echoes.</comment>
