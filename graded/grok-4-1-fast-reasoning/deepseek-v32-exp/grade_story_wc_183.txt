<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in seeking the garden via threads, but interiority leans abstract/poetic ("fractured heart," "blissfully aberrant") without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal weaving moments; final self-recapture feels earned but lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of memory-threads building to Conceptual Repricing closure in tapestry vision ("she recaptured not just a memory, but herself"), reconfiguring chimera identity with felt cost of "trapped freedom"; orientation anchored early (Elara on foggy ship); one tightening via fog shift to clearing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (creaking ship, damp wood, fog muffling, rain/roses scent) mirrors internal aberration and guides choices (deck walk to carousel to bow); ship-as-sanctuary/prison charges final image and constrains trapped quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture identity via garden) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through thread-weaving density and memory alterations narrowing to realization; agency in pulling threads/whispering names; cost legible in "trapped freedom" tone crystallizing Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant wholeness emerges organically from chimera particulars and thread-weaving, with final tapestry image offering resonant non-literal answer (solace kindles amid trap); avoids platitudes but risks minor pseudo-profundity in "whole and aberrant, yet at peace."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased toward memory-fragments and fog/textures; rhythmic modulation builds intensity without slippage; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "narrative threads" (repeated 5x without new pressure) and dense metaphors in peak beats slightly dull closure image; no major artifacts obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chimera discovery, narrative-threads method, and garden myth transforms identity-quest tropes; lyric accumulative structure risks boldly, heightening stakes via fog/ship constraints without gimmickry.</comment>
