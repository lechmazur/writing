<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as helix-minded engineer drives precise modifications, earning transformation; embodied quaking in bones grounds emotion. Weakness: no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal integration beats, smoothing internal conflict into tidy progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of integrated memories tightening to resonant reconfiguration at "she had become what she sought"; closure costs shedding old self legibly on page. Orientation anchors early; single scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and mirror constrain choices via refracted light spectrum painting walls, charging final image of silent mirror. Sensory selection (vibrating rocks, whispering breeze) mirrors internal reverie purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rewire via entangled memories signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening integrations climaxing at child's flying dream. Agency in chaotic gestures forecloses old self with felt cost; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of voicing abandoned dreams emerges organically from excavated memories like crystal library and flying child, resonating in final tapestry image without statement. Complexity lingers in rewired multitudes; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with helix-spiral perceptual signature (coils looping back) and rhythmic modulation in poetic-scientific diction under stress. Voice texture distinct, modulating intensity without drift or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overwriting with stacked metaphors (e.g., spiderweb mirror, spiraling coils) in peak integration beats muddles propulsion slightly; minor paraphrase loops on "entangled memories." Density strong otherwise, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synaptic engineering and dream archaeology transforms mysticism tropes via mirror mechanics and helix perception. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes coherently to charged closure.</comment>
