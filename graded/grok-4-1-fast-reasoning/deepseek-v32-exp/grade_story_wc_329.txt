<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reawaken beauty roots consistently in despair and ignites via locust shell, compelling descent and rhythmic play; embodied pulse answers her music effectively. Micro-choices like clutching shell under statue gaze reveal values with risk cost. Minor epiphanic summary at end ("true understanding had come") slightly undercuts prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shell discovery ignites plan, descent triggers statue tracking, rhythm play causes Warden quiver and uproot DC. Orientation anchors Elara/orchard/bridge by para 2. Closure DC legible with risk cost in "gap between knowing the risk and understanding the outcome" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Statues' rigid patrols constrain descent into clearing, forcing central confrontation; crystalline bridge and tarnished fruit charge initial/final renewal images. Sensory vibrations seep into earth, mirroring heart pulse. POV-filtered details like dim glow reflect Elara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) signaled early, tightens via rhythm mimicking heartbeat narrowing to crystal uproot with statue threat pressure. Agency in sustained play forecloses failure path; risk cost felt in unified statue heads tracking her. One causal reversal suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation via action in "gap" emerges organically from shell/heart rhythm/stones softening, reweighting mechanical order without statement. Final statues echoing her rhythms offers resonant non-literal answer. Repetitive "breaking free" phrasing borders on overt echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (music as frozen/heart signal); voice modulates from despair to peace via rhythmic prose. No dialogue; diction like "grinding shift" fits fantasy idiom. Minor repetition doesn't obscure perceptual signature under climax stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops in final third ("breaking free," "gap," "heart rhythms," "uproot," "resonantly soft") create synonym churn and dull closure image; e.g., shell purpose repeats across 4+ lines without new pressure. Template cadence in ending sentences ("Elara [did], [renewal]"). Density strong mid-story but artifacts cap propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin heart-rhythms signaling stone life transforms statue trope; locust shell reprise charges closure organically. Risk in soft music vs. mechanical order heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
