<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elian's motivation rooted in sister's loss drives concrete experiments, with embodied grief surfacing in memories during work; internal conflict between logic and acceptance resolves in earned shift. Minor diagnostic phrasing in epiphany ("mathematics of emotion was not about eliminating loss") edges from higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to projection of Lyra's face and CR closure ("motivation shifted from solving a problem to accepting a mystery"); cost legible in acceptance reconfiguring prior desperation. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits defaults without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stalactites' drips and mosaic constrain experiments, timing feedback loop and charging final image of eyes on stone. Sensory details (glowing fruits pulsing, damp soil) filtered through Elian's pattern-seeking bias integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding emotion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via glass eyes revealing auras then Lyra's projection, forcing realization that narrows options from quantification to integration. Agency in adjustments drives deepening with felt cost of acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of integrating loss emerges organically from orchard patterns mirroring imperfections, culminating in resonant CR without moralizing ("ambiguous loss is part of the human equation"). Chipped mosaic recharges as symbol of fitting wholes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with perceptual signature of mathematical pattern-seeing (e.g., "roots that twisted like ancient scripts"); rhythmic prose modulates from precise observation to lyrical close. No dialogue; elisions taught via experimental reveals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("dovetail" x4, "gently inventive" x3, paraphrase loops on acceptance/loss in final third) creates template cadence and synonym churn, dulling closure image density. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs; rhythm varies but scaffold drags propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes perceiving emotional auras in cavern orchard transforms math/emotion premise organically. Risk in fantastical orchard mechanics heightens stakes toward CR without gimmickry.</comment>
