<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Recovery motivation rooted in curiosity and past drives mapping choices, culminating in earned realignment with embodied emotion ("hands damp and trembling"); minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds to haze vision and final mushroom realignment as RR closure with legible emotional cost ("piercing" clarity sharp as the day it was formed).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (briny water, sweet rot) and micro-setting (mushrooms, masts, glass shards) constrain alignment choices and charge final glowing image; environment shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early tightens via pattern detection to haze rhythm and realignment deepening under Accumulative lens; protagonist agency in nudging forecloses fractured past with felt piercing cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken promises emerges organically from bargain vision and realignment; final image of restored balance offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting decay as reversible via resolve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (constellation patterns in wreckage); rhythmic prose modulates from crisp description to intensified haze beats without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action and sensory propulsion; purposeful "broken constellations" recurrence pattern-taught avoids loops, but minor label repetition ("chronic curiosity") slightly dulls peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy rings as memory-encrypting maps aligned to shipwreck constellations transforms folklore trope; method's ingenuity inevitable in hindsight from disrupted patterns.</comment>
