<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied progression from control (murmuring to leaf) to surrender (touching bark), with contradictory reluctance acting in scene; final acceptance earned by accumulated observations. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("reluctant metamorphosis") slightly abstracts peak realization without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of storm observations builds to CR closure in leaf release and final rain-soaking image, with felt conceptual cost of yielding control legible ("terrifying and alien concept"). Single tightening via moss absorption insight narrows options coherently; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (petrichor, trembling leaf, wet bark) filtered through nursery owner's priorities constrains choices (futile reinforcements) and charges final image (rain soaking her as solidarity). Mossy trellis evolves from structure to paradigm symbol without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. adaptation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through tree/moss/leaf observations forcing stance crystallization; release of leaf forecloses rigid methods with visible cost (old self broken open). Agency in observation-turned-action tightens pressure once sufficiently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of surrender yielding resilience emerges organically from particulars (bending tree, absorbing moss), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Repetitive phrasing of "metamorphosis" and "transformation" slightly undercuts subtextual implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (plant-vein maps, soil pH) and rhythmic modulation building to charged poise; diction purposeful and biased toward scientific observation. No head-hopping or withholding; compression serves lyric accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops on "transformation"/"metamorphosis" (e.g., "reluctant metamorphosis... sustaining transformation") create redundancy across final third, dulling closure propulsion; template cadence in realization beats (repeated "she realized/would no longer").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardening control trope via storm-driven release, with leaf/tree/moss particulars transforming epiphany into tangible arc; risks quiet internal lyricism heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
