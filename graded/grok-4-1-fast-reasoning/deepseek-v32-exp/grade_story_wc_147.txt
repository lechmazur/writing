<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to capture hush rooted in overriding instinct shows contradictory impulses acting in scene ("every instinct screamed... override instinct"); final success earned by micro-choices like gentle twist. Minor abstractness in embodied panic ("pressure mounted on his body and resolve") prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of hush and oxygen pressure building to on-page DC (vial captures hush) with legible cost (final oxygen alarm); one tightening at door opening narrows to sanctum. Orientation anchored immediately in temple dive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Underwater temple's phosphorescence, fractured beams, and mechanism constrain choices (precision vs. panic); cold hush blanket charges final vial image. Q7 debt caps above 8.7.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture hush before air out) escalates via mechanism/door under Accumulative lens with agency in overriding instinct; oxygen cost unmistakable in alarm chirp. Q7 debt caps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of self-rescue from lonesome solitude emerges organically via vial's memory and final "his own rescue"; resonant CR in uncorking image reweights ephemeral quest without moralizing. Repetitive motifs slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature on silence/memory; poetic rhythm modulates pressure (slow hush vs. blinking alarm). Minor repetition drifts texture; Q7 debt caps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and density overall, but paraphrase loops/synonym churn on "lonesome splendor" (x3), "gathered hush," "harness ephemeral" across final third dull closure image (−1.5); template echoes in triumph summaries.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-capture in memory-vial transforms underwater quest trope; risk in instinct-override pays off at closure. Q7 debt caps; no close famous echoes.</comment>
