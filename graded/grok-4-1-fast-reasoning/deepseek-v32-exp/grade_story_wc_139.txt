<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in refusing father's tricks drives choices; internal conflict embodied in planning phase. Chief's sudden shift via ink pot feels unearned, flattening secondary character at pivotal confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: waiting leads to ink pot solution, mental breach as DC with documents handover. CR in realization transforms premise; cost legible in emptying pot and moral navigation. Orientation anchored early in prep room.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prep room and ink pot as micro-settings constrain tactics (polishing casket sparks idea) and charge final image perfectly. Sensory details (stainless table, dried crimson) filter through Leo's priorities, vivid and purposeful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fair trade via fluidity vs rigidity emerges from ink pot events and final CR repricing deceit as tool for truth. Resonant without moralizing; "fluidity endures" reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (deathly vitality lens); voice modulates poetically. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-heavy in "fairness of a trade"; no head-hopping.</comment>
