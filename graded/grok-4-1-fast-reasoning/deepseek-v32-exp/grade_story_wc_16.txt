<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust drives micro-choices like bolder promises, with embodied fear (trembling hands) contradicting hope. Interior conflict emerges in risking ancient magics, earned by backstory cues tilting present vows. Final forgiveness vow reveals values hierarchy with relational cost, satisfying 9+ test diagnostically but minor label-speak ("cautious exuberance") caps at 8.7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: promises densify energy (glyphs brighten, air hums) to RR closure as symphonies swell and Kaelen arrives, reconfiguring silence with felt risk cost ("risking everything"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara in archive before dawn). No lens ambiguity; persistent ink constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ink well and scroll glyphs constrain choices (glow per vow, rewrite at climax), charging final overflow/map image. Sensory details (humming air, pulsing well) weave via POV urgency, mirroring internal shifts without overt symbolism. Archive as sanctuary/prison pressures isolation until door creaks, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust pre-dawn) signaled early; accumulative escalation via vow sequence tightens pressure (brighter glows, trembling at fifth), narrowing options with magic risk cost. Agency in vow-writing drives deepening to RR; visible trade-off (reckless leaps) charges end without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected truths emerges via promise chain reshaping glyphs/reality, resonant in final harmony/map without moralizing. Subtext in silence backstory tilts via vows; ending image answers restoration question non-literally, reweighting prior knots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (linguist notices glyphs/shimmers); voice texture (arcane rhythm) modulates under stress. Kaelen's brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("I felt it"), distinguishing idiom. Clean free indirect style; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with vow beats accelerating to climax; high density integrates action/atmosphere sans major loops. Minor paraphrase in "symphonies" repetitions purposeful for accumulative lens, but repetitive "vow" stems in sequence slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic magic (truth-reactive ink, promise chains decoding prophecy) transforms mentor rift trope organically. Risky conceit (interconnected vows reshaping reality) heightens stakes coherently to closure; no derivative echoes.</comment>
