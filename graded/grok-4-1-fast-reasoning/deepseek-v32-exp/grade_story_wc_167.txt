<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via glazier-specific perceptions like hairline fractures shines, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the ripple scene; realization feels earned yet serene without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density increase from ripples to sun beam; CR lands on-page in "She smiled, ready for whatever came next," reweighting dredging with conceptual cost of propagation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium and pond constrain choices and charge final rainbow image; sensory details like mist coiling ankles and plop filtered through glazier bias elevate to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pre-shift clarity signaled early tightens accumulatively via ripple patterns, but low visceral pressure and absent trade-off in pivotal stone throw limit entry to high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mundane propagation emerges organically from pebble to light without moralizing; final radiant storm offers resonant CR reweighting change, though epiphany borders pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in pattern-reading; rhythmic prose modulates from misty gray to radiant without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but minor overwriting in figurative runs like "liquid rainbows" and "cathedral of clear complexity" risks coherence without stronger pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier trade with ripple philosophy transforms mundane dawn into profound CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens without gimmickry, though glazier trope leans familiar.</comment>
