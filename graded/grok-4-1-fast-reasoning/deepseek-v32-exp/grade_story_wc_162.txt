<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through analysis of grain and logbook; interiority concrete in tracing vibrations and spirals, embodied in "featherly determined" resolve. Earned change from lost to keeper via causal introspection, with cost of magnified chasms. Minor diagnostic articulation in realizations like "sacred thresholds emerged where distances were necessary" prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from arrival to grain/logbook correlation; orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Closure as CR in "The drifting prism terrace stabilized... light no longer fractured but whole," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of honored distances. Single tightening via recurring spiral suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: crystalline planes catch light, wood grain vibrates/swirls as maps. Bench grain constrains analysis choice and charges final image of paths/mazes. Purposeful selection mirrors internal shift from fractured to whole; no white-room as terrace drift pressures threshold crossing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why thresholds sacred) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via "spiral that mirrored the logbook's code," narrowing to emotional/temporal gaps. Agency in tracing/analyzing forecloses guessing path with felt cost of introspection. Escalation coheres under lens to Charged Poise at luminous doorframe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacred distances emerges organically from maze echoes in grain/logbook, reweighted in CR ending. Resonant non-literal answer in terrace stabilization and "serenity" code. Slight moralizing in final lines ("doors to becoming," "glue that holds it together") abstracts resonance, preventing elite band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature: biased noticing of patterns in grain/prisms as sacred maps. Voice rhythmic/modulates from hush to hum, purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early. No head-hopping; diction consistent with child's intuitive lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (hush rustles to hum); density high in multi-job lines like grain tracing echoing mazes. Paraphrase loops in ending ("necessary distances" x4, recapitulated realizations) dull closure image, applying -0.8 non-closure cap. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze butterfly effect with wood grain/pilot codes into prismatic introspection transforms tropes. Bold lyric risks heighten stakes in threshold crossing without gimmickry. Irreplaceable premise angle on sacred pauses earns hindsight inevitability.</comment>
