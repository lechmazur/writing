<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in decaying directive drives interpretation to transcendence; interiority embodied in grit-etched eyes and dream-images. Minor epiphany slip in "paths choose their walkers when the walker's essence resonates" feels diagnostic, but earned via merged sights.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dual sights to merged revelation and seal dissolution as CR closure with conceptual cost of decayed directive. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker and storm constrain choices (vines scrape door, seal pulses on wall) and charge final gateway image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under storm urgency: ozone, grit, ethereal hum mirror internal merge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover path-choosing) escalates via accumulative dream density, stone arrangement, and storm catalyst narrowing to transcendence trade-off. Cost legible in directive's crumble freeing her amid chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from path resonance and transcendence; final gateway image reweights premise without overt moral. Minor echo in "lived truth woven into the wind" borders statement but ties to storm flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature: dual sights filter world in "echoes... shimmer." Rhythmic prose modulates from precise play to ethereal chaos, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful in accumulative texture (glowing path as current). Minor path-motif repetition accumulates pressure without loop; no scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dual sight, living paths, and dream-seal transcendence transforms mystic tropes; bold CR payoff feels inevitable from directive decay.</comment>
