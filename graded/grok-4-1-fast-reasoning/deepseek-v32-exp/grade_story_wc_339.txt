<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong analytic trait roots motivation and compels exploration, with embodied shift in "felt a lightness" at ascent; slips in diagnostic phrasing like "physics of letting go" verge on unearned epiphany without full contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via artifact discoveries tightening to CR closure in "knew that letting go was not loss but integration," with legible conceptual cost in releasing ghosts; orientation anchored early in descent, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken library vividly constrains via "fissure in the hull" entry and "shelves like skeletons"; snow globe as micro-setting charges final image of flakes' "cycle of chaos and calm," mirroring turmoil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding letting go deepens accumulatively through globe/transmission/note, narrowing to renunciation with agency in writing/placing her note; cost felt in "weight of that grasp" forecloses clinging path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of release emerges organically from threads/globe/flakes to resonant CR ending without moralizing; captain's note on "buoyancy that lifts" borders overt but anchors via artifact, reweighting Earhart vanishing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with analytic perceptual signature in "shifting water pressures"; rhythmic control modulates elegantly from descent tension to ascent poise, distinct texture purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "untangling threads" literal/metaphorical and "sophisticated melancholy" repetition dull slightly; no artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh sunken library as archive of relinquishment transforms artifact-recovery trope, with globe's flakes as inevitable synthesis charging CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
