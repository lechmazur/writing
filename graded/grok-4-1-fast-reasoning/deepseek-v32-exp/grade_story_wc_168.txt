<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to translate pain via reflection, but interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "bargained innocence" and stock epiphanies, diluting embodied contradiction in pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("breaks never fully mend, yet still hold value"); orientation anchored early; cost legible in final acceptance image without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge and scarred body constrain solitary reflection; recurring box charges final image; sensory details (scars tingle, gravel scuff) selectively mirror internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating pain) signaled early with accumulative deepening via layered memories; one cadence shift to realization forecloses solitary burden at cost of enduring unhealed breaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of shared resilience emerges organically from scars/box but weakens via explicit statements ("universal language," "enlighten others"); final image offers non-literal resonance without full moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (celestial/meditative noticing); voice texture poetic yet consistent; no head-hopping, but minor syntactic repetition undercuts peak rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops (e.g., "reflecting deeply," "transmute pain" across paragraphs) and synonym churn ("pain/agony/loss/grief") dull density; artifacts pervade final third, obscuring closure propulsion; template cadence in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter scars and porcelain box as fracture/wholeness; transforms trauma trope via celestial reflection, but ridge-walk redemption arc feels familiar without bold risk.</comment>
