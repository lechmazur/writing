<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in clutching cloth while deflecting to Mara with facts, earning the final pivot to hybrid purpose without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as fact-density builds to Mara's breach and idea-spark reconfiguration; Charged Poise closure lands via framed cloth image with felt emotional cost of forgoing insulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dusty trailer and grille cloth as micro-setting constrain isolation and charge final frame, with selective sensory focus (silence pressing, fingers tracing) mirroring internal urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant purpose-after-loss stake tightens accumulatively via Mara's empathy forcing idea-deepening; agency in renouncing insulation forecloses fact-only path with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from relics emerges organically via cloth's reprise, but "core concept haunting him: after the applause" borders on echo, slightly overt despite resonant end image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual bias (facts as shield) yields distinct texture; Mara's dialogue carries subtextual pressure naturally, distinguishing voices without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Solid propulsion with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops on "longing" and "wrest" (three uses) create minor churn, dulling peak density without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Roadie-appraiser hybrid transforms redemption trope via memorabilia niche, feeling inevitable in cloth's arc; fresh synthesis elevates without gimmick.</comment>
