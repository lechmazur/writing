<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied glassblowing actions and thawing grief; micro-choices like selecting cobalt rod reveal values. Contradictory detachment vs. thaw impulses act in scene, with earned renunciation of old studio. Minor therapy-speak in epiphanies ("thaw within her") slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via glassblowing ritual and melting ice sync. Closure as Charged Poise in leaving sphere/bookmark with felt cost of imperfection acceptance. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via bookmark cue deepens stake without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (breath misting, drip-drip ice, molten pearl) filter through glassblower's priorities, constraining choices like portable furnace use. Recurring window/ice charges final image, mirroring thaw. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent in single room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (craft safe zones amid thaw) signaled early; textural deepening via narration/ritual narrows to acceptance of flaws, with cost in abandoning order. Agency in patient shaping forecloses perfectionism. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, but internal focus mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of inquiry via imperfect sanctuaries emerges organically from bubble flaw and bookmark story; final image reweights premise without moral. Subtext in thawing mirrors avoids binaries. Resonant non-literal close: "messy, beautiful process."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in dramatic narration ("great fire awakens"); rhythm modulates with ritual. Voice distinct via intoned whispers. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "clink of glass rods... echoing"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor paraphrase loops in thaw metaphors ("slow unfreezing... pliable") dull slightly, but no closure touch. Clean syntax, strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glassblowing safe zones in control room transforms inquiry trope via thaw physics. Bookmark/glass imperfections feel inevitable. Bold ritual narration risks pretension but heightens stakes organically.</comment>
