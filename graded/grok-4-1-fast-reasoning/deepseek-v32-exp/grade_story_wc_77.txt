<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in post-resuscitation hollowness intensifies through embodied dread (shuddering, trembling voice), compelling the confession micro-choice; advisor's pressure reveals character limits without safety-hedging. Internal conflict embodied in paradoxical notes acting simultaneously. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "I am afraid..." confession slightly undercuts peak authenticity but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sensory entry to mirror climax; orientation anchored early at funhouse maw. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via clasp throw and white explosion reconfigures fear's options with felt emotional cost in "strange peace." One tightening via shadow's recoil narrows path; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (rust/cotton candy scent drawing her in) reflects Elara's POV bias and mirrors internal dread, constraining choices like clasp-to-light reveal. Funhouse choreography coherent, evolving with luminance flare to charge final cleared mirror image. Micro-setting via clasp-as-object pressures climax without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear for wholeness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via advisor guidance to confession declaration narrowing options; agency in unbosoming forecloses hollow echo path. Cost legible in recoiling shadow and hot clasp gamble charging final image. Coherent pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Paradox theme (fear as parasite needing host) emerges organically from dictionary notes and shadow confrontation, reweighted in final "strength in the emptiness" without moralizing. Subtext in repulsive allure modulating to inner light offers resonant non-literal answer. Complexity lingers in accepted contradictions, tied to arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (decay as allure through post-death lens); whispers natural, goal-driven subtext advancing beats. Prose rhythm modulates tension, diction biased to Elara's fragile state. No head-hopping; compression purposeful in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates action/atmosphere; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("swirling, malevolent darkness"/"hunger made visible") muddles slightly mid-beat but clears by closure. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs propel to clasp throw. "Repulsive allure" purposeful recurrence, not churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed object, paradoxical dictionary, and fear-tricking rite in funhouse transforms tropes via specific post-death stakes; mirror shadow embodiment and clasp absorption feel inevitable. Bold conceit payoff in photographic void meeting light risks surrealism but coheres under textural lens.</comment>
