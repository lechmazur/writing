<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority in carving sequence reveals character through hands guided by projections; motivation rooted in artistic traits intensifies credibly. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "motivation crystallized" slightly abstracts peak realization without embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of visions building to CR closure: sculpture reconfigures guidance from tech to internal with cost of ignoring revived GPS in final line. Orientation anchored early; single scene causality clean from slide discovery to carving payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and turbine-hum constrain choices (prying slide, return through rain) and charge final image of embodied history; sensory details (stinging rain, humming vibration) filter through artistic POV bias. Driftwood as micro-setting evolves tactilely with carving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creative direction post-GPS failure tightens accumulatively via layered visions narrowing to intuitive carving agency; cost legible in forsaking solitary work for timewoven form. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of historical alliances simplifying chaos emerges organically from projections to spiral sculpture; final image offers non-literal resonance reweighting isolation vs. connection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct artistic perceptual signature (noticing forms in chaos, grained interconnections) with rhythmic modulation under reverie; stable third-limited POV; no dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("depthless nebula," "timewoven alliances") clusters slightly in reverie beats without obscuring closure. Few loops; scaffold minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic slide ghosts inspiring driftwood reimagining transforms artist-lost trope via specific time alliances; risk in lyrical accumulation pays off at embodied closure.</comment>
