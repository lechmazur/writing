<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to excavate truth drives consistent micro-choices like reassembling letters and digging; skepticism shifts to burdened acceptance earned through discoveries. Interiority concrete via embodied observation under chill and dust. Minor label-speak in "excavate truth from comfortable lies" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of observation (geometry, letters, rings) tighten to Charged Poise closure where diamond activates stillpoint but demands sacrifice, cost legible in flickering light and creeping winds. Orientation anchored early in orchard post-liquidation. Single scene causality intact, one deepening via intuition suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Paradoxical orchard constrains digging and charges final stillpoint sphere amid dust; selective sensory details (glowing dust, numb fingers, pulsing diamond) mirror internal uncovering. Environment evolves causally with activation. No white-room; tactile navigation vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth from rumor) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via letter revelations narrowing to sacrifice choice; agency in piecing and digging forecloses debunking path. Cost unmistakable in "a life for a life" and returning winds under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth's burdensome power emerges organically from letters' bargain and diamond's activation, reweighting liquidation as murder via final CR image of clutched stone. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in choice without tidy resolution. Resonance from orchard paradox particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of sharp, geometric noticing; voice texture modulates from skeptical to revelatory without head-hopping. Prose rhythm purposeful, diction POV-appropriate. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; minor stock phrases ("hours bled," "bruised sky") but no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Read-aloud rhythm strong; figurative consistency supports post-apoc tone without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of debunker uncovering orchard-sustaining diamond reconfigures post-apoc tropes via flawed gem's energetic map; risky Charged Poise ending commits to conceptual cost without hedging. Transformation of curse as consequence feels inevitable.</comment>
