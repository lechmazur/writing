<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices like breathing into stiffness reveal contradictory impulses under trauma pressure, earning the final grafting as integration. Diagnostic label-speak ("somatic markers," "somatic awareness") in peak memory beats feels unearned and therapy-like, flattening crisis immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from aircraft hum trigger to memory deepening, yielding Charged Poise closure in grafting image that reconfigures past/future with felt grief cost ("refusing to let paralysis win"). Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (brine scent, salt-scorched earth, wind-whisper) filter through Elara's nurturing bias, mirroring internal resilience and constraining her tending actions. Cliff-edge walk and lighthouse beam charge final acceptance image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trauma integration signaled early escalates accumulatively via hum-induced freeze and memory deepening, forcing agency in refusal and grafting that forecloses denial with visible emotional cost. Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of realism-grounded optimism emerges organically from grafting as memory-future blend, with final image resonating non-literally. Repetitive thesis echoes ("anchored optimism," "realism and optimism met") in closeout weaken subtext subtlety.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature biased toward plants/body (e.g., "chill on her skin, tightness in chest"), modulating rhythmically under stress. Poetic diction consistent and voice-motivated without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("pearl of stillness" x3, "somatic markers" x4, "crumpled photograph" phrasing churn) and paraphrase redundancy (healing summaries in final third) dull propulsion and obscure closure image. Therapy-speak and template cadence ("She [action], [reflection]") create artifact drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone strike trauma with arboretum nurturing transforms resilience trope via specific grafting metaphor. Risky lyric accumulation feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
