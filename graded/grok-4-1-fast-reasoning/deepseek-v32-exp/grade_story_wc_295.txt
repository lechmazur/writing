<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mentor's promise drives consistent interiority and earned change from doubt to peace. Embodied warmth mending fatigue reveals character under pressure. Minor diagnostic slips like "emotional barometers" slightly abstract impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from dreams to stellar mapping; CR closure in final image of telegram reconfigures isolation into connection with felt cost of lightened burdens. Orientation anchored early in observatory. One tightening via Mira observation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory and telescope constrain decoding choices; Mira's pulsing light charges final CR image. Sensory details like humming instruments filtered through Elara's starry bias. Vivid without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode for communal healing signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dream-star alignment narrowing doubt. Agency in adjusting telescope and speaking phrases forecloses ignorance path with fatigue-mending cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emergent theme of stellar empathy from particulars like chants, but repetitive "shared burdens" echoes thesis directly. Final paragraphs moralize universals, triggering -0.6 penalty; lacks lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual starry/mystic signature; rhythm modulates from haunted to peaceful. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens. Capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("shared burdens," "healing with words," "midnight solace," "understanding dawned") across realizations create redundancy, dulling density; synonym churn in epiphanies. Template cadence in repetitive sentence stems harms propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreams, variable stars, and ancient healing transforms tropes organically. Variable-star decoding as emotional barometer offers non-obvious angle charging CR closure.</comment>
