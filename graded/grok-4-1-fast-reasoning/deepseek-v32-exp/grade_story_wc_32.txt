<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait concretely constrains hesitation at climax ("hesitation gripped him, as it always did"), enabling earned defiance surge; contradictory fear/defiance impulses act simultaneously in pivotal shatter moment, with final thaw as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via successive ritual beats culminating in on-page Decisive Change (crozier shatters/reforms); penny-drop insight ("fear was the very barrier") tightens options with legible cost in heart-stopping explosion pause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains ritual (energy vivifies fragments) and charges closure image (burns brighter in approval); twilight-to-night shift mirrors internal thaw, with pulsed embers filtering stoic perception purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify to interrupt destiny) signaled early escalates via agency-driven embrace of destruction, narrowing options; cost unmistakable in shatter-fear beat before Charged Poise success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Creative destruction theme emerges organically from ritual beats, resonant in final crozier-warmth image repricing prophecy; minor thematic echo in repeated "penny dropped" slightly overtells closure resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (failures as "sharp, internal wound," alchemical priorities); rhythmic control heightens pressure in shatter beat without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density in ritual beats, but paraphrase loops ("creative destruction," "stifling destiny") in final third dull closure propulsion; varied rhythm holds, no filter stacks or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes transformed via alchemical crozier vivification and bishop relic specificity; bold creative destruction synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, risking total shatter for renewal.</comment>
