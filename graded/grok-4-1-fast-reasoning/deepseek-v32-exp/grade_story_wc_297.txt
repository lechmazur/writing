<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation via root aches and scar tingles compel the crossing; contradictory duty-freedom impulses act in the portal step. Minor diagnostic slips like "purposefully curious" slightly abstract traits without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to portal; on-page RR closure via root transformation with emotional cost legible in "laughed through her tears." Orientation anchored early in glade/dusk; one tightening via clipping trace suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade constrains via fused roots straining at portal; dusk shadows and ozone scent mirror internal anxious elation, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects visionary POV without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intersection/covenant) tightens accumulatively through visions deepening knowledge/cost; agency in scar-linking forecloses root-binding with tears/sweat price. Minor abstractness in covenant before on-page flood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of scar-embrace emerges organically via clipping/root evolution, reweighting balance in final bridge-light image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with visionary perceptual signature in root-pulse sensations; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, e.g., short peak sentences at crossing. Experimental fantasy diction consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; purposeful metaphors (roots as chain/bridge) cohere without muddle. Minor "anxious elation" reprise borders loop but tones payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of root-fusion fantasy and scar-linking transforms portal trope; clipping dissolution feels inevitable from early setup. Bold imagery risks pay off in charged closure.</comment>
