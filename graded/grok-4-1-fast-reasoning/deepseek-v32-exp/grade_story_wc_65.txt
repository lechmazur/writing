<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in hesitation over energy source vs. monopoly risk, embodied in quill tremble; final writing choice earned by mapped voids and models. Minor label-speak ("groundedly imaginative") slightly genericizes traits without full tradeoff visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anticipation to writing, culminating in CR via thawing lake reconfiguring stagnation with conceptual cost of risked chaos. Orientation anchored early; single tightening in meta-narrative shift suffices, but reflective blocks borderline BRR at ~25% without stronger micro-choice anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake and obsidian ink constrain choices (mirroring stagnation, clarity sought) and charge final thaw image; quill as micro-setting handled tactilely. Sensory selection purposeful, POV-biased toward voids/possibilities; no white-room—gloom, reflections integrate seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed innovation sans chaos) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via model refinements and meta-story decision narrowing options. Agency in quill dip/write forecloses hesitation path; cost felt in tremble and chaos warning, legible in cracks' emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative discovery emerges organically from particulars (models, meta-narrative); final thaw offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in fear-of-unknown constraint vs. shared purpose; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (void-mapping, predictive arcs); rhythmic texture modulates from poised anticipation to surging fulfillment. Purposeful repetition (quill, models) taught early as pattern; no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor paraphrase loops on "predictive models" (e.g., repeated updating) dull mid-section slightly without obscuring closure. No major artifacts; metaphors consistent (kingfisher dive), overwriting contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ignorance cartography and meta-writing transforms stasis trope; bold risk in self-referential narrative heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight payoff in thawing echo; no derivative hedging.</comment>
