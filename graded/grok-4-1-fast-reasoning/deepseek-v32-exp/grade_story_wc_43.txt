<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to execute a flawless goodbye is consistent and drives actions like recording the message, but lacks deep interior contradiction or embodied stress; "decisively kind" feels labeled rather than revealed through costly micro-choices. Alistair's faint smile and whisper show particularity under pressure. No safety-hedging flaws complicate peak moments like Lena's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via motifs (vinyl, scents, hymns) to Charged Poise closure in Alistair's peaceful death with shard bedside—"a testament to how fragments can hold wholeness"—with felt cost of loss reconfiguring Elara's purpose. Orientation anchored early (hospice, blood work). One tightening: Lena's arrival reunifies, narrowing to flawless goodbye.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection—"scent of hope from jasmine blossoms," "sunlight fell across the floor"—mirrors Elara's serene priorities, charging final vinyl image; mountain haven subtly frames eternal calm without constraining choices. Atmosphere tensions life/death via sky expanse. Spatial choreography clear across days.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) signaled early post-blood work, tightens accumulatively through hymns, message, Lena's embrace, to death; agency in Elara's facilitation forecloses regret with relational cost legible in "years of silence." Pressure coheres texturally without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness in fragments emerges organically via vinyl shard's reprise—from wedding memory to bedside testament—reweighting mundane into sacred without moralizing; final Elara reflection offers non-literal answer on endings' light. Subtext in reunion bridges silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with serene perceptual signature (rhythms, scents); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Clara and I danced to this"), advances reunification. Rhythmic modulation suits tone, though minor repetition in narration. No head-hopping; distance apt for intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Repetitive motif phrasing—"pulsing stillness" (4x), "scent of hope" (4x), "hymning the mundane" (3x)—creates paraphrase loops and template cadence in closing paragraphs, dulling closure image density. Minor overwriting in "quiet energy that made the moment feel both eternal and deeply calm." Propulsion varies but scaffold drags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy tropes via broken vinyl and "hymning the mundane" transforms hospice clichés into resonant fragments/wholeness; risk in ethereal tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Motifs feel organic, not checklist.</comment>
