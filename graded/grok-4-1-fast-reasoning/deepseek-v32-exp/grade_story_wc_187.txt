<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies accumulatively through monument examinations, compelling higher-stakes conjecture; interiority concrete via embodied listening to whispers and pang at flood tale. Lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning reflective over conflicted; epiphany at third monument ("identity wasn't carved from solitary events") borders unearned but supported by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first shadow measurement to closure CR ("new stillness within"); orientation anchored by ~50 words (observatory, solid fog). One meaningful deepening across monuments narrows identity options; cost legible in reconfigured nostalgia and shimmering fog image, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (crystal murmurs like steam, unnaturally long shadows) filter through archivist's priorities, constraining method and mirroring internal states. Environment charges closure (whispers chorus, solid fog shimmers); spatial choreography coherent across forecourt monuments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpt identity) signaled early, deepens texturally via shadow/whisper accumulations forcing stance shift; agency in precise measurements and conjectures forecloses solitary path. Escalation coheres under lens with one tightening at third monument (shortest shadow hints peace), cost felt in embraced shadows; minor abstractness in stakes pre-epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared memory vs. solitary identity emerges organically from whispers/shadows, resists tidy morals via ambiguity in fog's permanence. Final image ("sculpted his identity... from the echoes") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without statement; protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing shadow elongations, whisper responses); rhythmic modulation builds hush texture, syntax reflects contemplative mind. Purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens, no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in whispers rising), high density in integrated details; minor paraphrase loops ("deepening hush" x3, "preemptive nostalgia" x2) create template cadence without closure harm. Some overwriting in monument descriptions dulls propulsion, but scaffold absent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of solid fog, whispering crystals, shadow-measuring into identity theme feels inevitable; risk in fantasy hush transforms nostalgia trope organically. No close echoes, bold perceptual angle heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
