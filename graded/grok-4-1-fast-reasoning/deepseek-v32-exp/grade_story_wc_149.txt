<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian's mournful elation and the ghost bride's lovingly venomous actions show embodied contradiction, compelling the climax bead exchange. Interiority concrete in "chill that was both comforting and painful," earning the resonant acceptance. Minor slip: limited micro-choices beyond sensing and reaching dilute struggle depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fleeting visits densify to direct appearance and bead transfer, yielding Charged Poise closure as she fades with "wave of mournful elation." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse under endless night. One tightening—frequent visits signal time running out—forecloses options with felt cost of her dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard's luminescent fruits and glass panes constrain isolation, mirroring internal states via glow brightening post-awakening. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: Elian notices chill and rustling leaves amid crisis. Final thriving orchard charges closure image, proving environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—debt repayment—tightens accumulatively as visits escalate to offering, narrowing to bead touch with agency in Elian's reach. Cost legible in her fade and his solitude-yet-contentment. Climax turn driven by her purposeful confrontation tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive love emerges organically via bead-triggered memories and orchard response, reweighting loss into peace. Final image of bead on shelf offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in "joy intertwined with sharp sorrow" invites ambiguity on affection's poison.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elian with clean perceptual bias toward ghostly flickers and chills. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in climax "memories flooded...vivid and overwhelming." Sparse dialogue natural: "Take it" advances goal with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("ghost bride," "mournful elation") teaching motif pattern, but paraphrase loops like repeated "endless night" and "hush" drag momentum (−0.6). Rhythm varies for propulsion; no major artifacts dull closure. Clean syntax supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost trope via alchemical bead catalyst and orchard resonance transforms debt motif into "resonant awakenings." Risky accumulative hauntings build to inevitable payoff. Irreplaceable: bead's wedding token specificity grounds past-life ingenuity.</comment>
