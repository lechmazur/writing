<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in steel arms cradling fragile empathy amid retrocognitive prisons; renaming earned by surging visions and pattern-tracing under pressure. Minor diagnostic label ("gentle radical") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory anchors (plaza, tessera) by ~100 words, surges accumulate to pattern-map revelation → renaming DC/RR with legible cost ("trap shudder and crack"; visions loosen to echoes). Closure reconfigures stance with persistent price felt on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurrent tessera/stone constrain choices (kneel, trace) and charge final image (clutched link to beauty); "warm coldness" motif mirrors internal shift, selective senses (ash-heat, clay fingertips) filter via POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break retrocognitive trap to armor empathy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via surges → intuitive tracing → revelation; agency in rename forecloses past-identity path with felt cost (shuddering hold), charging poise legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (empathy armored post-trauma) emerges organically from mosaic-map transformation and final image ("empathy... strongest steel"); resonant non-literal answer reweights fire's cruelty via aberrant mercy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical single-POV stable, perceptual signature (retrocognitive pulses, fractured glyphs) biased/character-specific; rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise, diction purposeful without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm, read-aloud ear strong; minor paraphrase loops ("mosaic stepping stone," empathy-steel refrains) accumulate texturally without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognitive trap + glyph-map of "states of being" → rename rebirth transforms trauma tropes; mosaic as intuitive revelation feels inevitable, risks lyric accumulation payoff.</comment>
