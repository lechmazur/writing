<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in bone-vibrating hum and raw mind, with contradictory fight/coexist impulses acting in scene; earned shift to guardian role with cost of embracing loss. Minor slips in over-articulated realizations like "independence would come from embracing these truths" border diagnostic speak but don't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from memory fragments to hum-activated visions, tightening to Charged Poise closure where sundial's final image reconfigures isolation as legacy with felt cost of loss acceptance. Orientation anchored early in library above clouds; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like floating books on tides and stone hum constrain choices and charge final image; recurring sundial as micro-setting enables projections and mirrors shift, evolving with events without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intensifying hum and settling visions that narrow options to embrace/foreclose fleeing; agency in approaching circle and holding sundial high, with legible cost in painful memories accepted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Coherent theme of coexistence emerges organically from visions and final sundial image reweighting past ghosts as companions; resonant non-literal answer in "brittle awakening" turning sorrow to purpose. Minor thematic echo in explicit "translated isolation into independence" slightly tells rather than fully implies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in misty, tidal phrasing; rhythmic modulation heightens hum's intensification without filter excess or leakage, prose texture lyrical and character-biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varying rhythm supports accumulative build; minor paraphrase loops in "brittle awakening" repetitions and realization synonyms (−0.4) don't obscure closure image of sundial's spirit-time.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation, humming stones, and atomically reflective sundial transforms extinction trope into legacy arc; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
