<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to reclaim light intensifies credibly through covenant pressure and townsman interruption, earning the final tethering with embodied hands tracing gears. Internal conflict via truth-testing feels particular, not stock. Minor abstraction in "feel the gaps where light should be" slightly detaches embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descriptive density builds from spring adjustment to shimmering notes and light wave, culminating in RR closure (world brightens) with legible cost (wilting halted by confession). Single scene oriented early; townsman beat tightens via motivated causality. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains choices (amplifies song, vibrates purpose) and charges final image (echoes triumphant symphony as door closes). Sensory hierarchy sharpens via tinkersong (tinkled notes, pulsed light). POV bias filters brass gears and oil-stained fingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim light) signaled early; accumulative escalation via faltering box → confession → strengthening song narrows options with felt cost (tarnishing edges). Townsman reversal driven by Elian's urging tests commitment. Closure agency in channeling chip forecloses decay path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth mending decay emerges organically from covenant tests and song-weaving; final image (stepping into brightened day with lingering rust) offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting craft-as-healing. No moralizing; ambiguity in resolve enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (traces gears, feels fractures) biased to tinkersong idiom. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven (urging truth advances plot). Voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose texture distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn dull propulsion: "mending what isn't torn" recurs 4x, "in the balance" 3x, "tinkersong wonder" 3x across ending beats without pattern payoff, obscuring closure image. Template cadence in repetitive descriptive runs (e.g., light/pulse/glow cluster). Density otherwise strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosopher's stone chip, rust covenant, and unseen mending transforms fantasy tropes into tactile reality-weaving. Risky poetic frame heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration (light tethered via song) feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
