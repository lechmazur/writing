<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to transform confusion into exploration is embodied and intensifies through sketching and sensor work, earning the final resolve to depart. Interiority concrete via compass tracing and star pull; minor label-speak in "blessed pariah" opening slightly genericizes but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from silence to star discovery tightening stake, culminating in Charged Poise closure where purposeful steps reconfigure isolation as prelude with isolation cost legible in "mad plan" and post abandonment. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks, pattern pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Time dilation deck constrains actions via warped perception and slow adjustments, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (breath whispers, drifting stars) reflects urgency. Compass rose as micro-setting recurs to enable navigation resolve; vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confusion to purpose) signaled early, deepens via star glimpse narrowing options to journey; agency in recalibrating sensors forecloses vigil with felt isolation cost. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of tradition guiding isolation emerges organically from sketching custom and star-as-true-north, reweighting silence in final image without moralizing. Compass and star reprise shifts meaning from anchor to key, inviting ambiguity on "deeper calling."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in temporal distortions; diction modulates from hushed to urgent. No dialogue; rhythmic control supports accumulative build without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive "echoed silence" (4x) and "temporally stretched" loops create mild paraphrase churn, dulling mid-density; synonym cycles on confusion/purpose add scaffold. Rhythm varies but template "He [action]" stems in planning beat drag propulsion; closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation solitude, family sketching rite, and anomalous star transforms isolation trope into navigational Charged Poise. Compass-star convergence feels inevitable; risks bold solo arc without gimmick.</comment>
