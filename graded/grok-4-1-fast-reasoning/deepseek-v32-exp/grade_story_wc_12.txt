<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to illuminate assumptions is singular and intensifies through layered actions like looping phrases, compelling the climax choice; interiority concrete in embodied will (motivation burns) but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, limiting depth at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound layers and rhetorical phrases build density to CR closure ("possession recoiled...fragmented"); cost legible in dimming palette and rewoven peace; orientation anchored early ("dimensional anchor...Father Elian"), one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chamber's unraveled stillness and stone altar constrain choices (thumb on floor, suppress hum); recurring blue mark pulses and bleeds, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (hush over hum) reflects priestly priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt possession) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density (loop chorus, rhetorical paradox to recoil); agency in intonations narrows options with felt cost (entity's certainty unraveled); one deepening at final question suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of exposing flawed assumptions emerges organically from rhetoric and silence overpowering noise; final image ("palette...dim, its purpose fulfilled") offers resonant CR repricing without moral; subtext in "What is taken is never truly held" lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (rhetorical noticing, silence as decoration); rhythmic prose modulates with loops mirroring content; intonations natural and goal-driven, advancing unraveling without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (plumb, decorate) taught as pattern, varying rhythm supports propulsion; no loops or artifacts dull climax ("final, devastating question"); concrete images over generics propel to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop pedal, single ultramarine, rhetorical exorcism transforms possession trope; risk in abstract conceptual battle heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via silence > noise; no derivative echoes.</comment>
