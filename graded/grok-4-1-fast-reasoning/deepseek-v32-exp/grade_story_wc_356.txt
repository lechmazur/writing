<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines through olfactory embodiment and ambition-patience conflict, with micro-choices like journaling revealing values; epiphany earned via scent shift tying to prior frustration. Final serenity reconfiguration forecloses forced cultivation path with felt cost of blindness. Minor slip in tidy emotional arc without deeper irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in seed crack and realization, reweighting ambition with patience cost legible in "tiny emergence fueled by the village's collective shift." Orientation anchored early in treetop home; single scene coherent. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Journal and seed as recurring objects constrain choices and charge final image ("doodles now a map of her journey"); olfactory POV filters vivid details like "wet stone and ozone." Environment guides action via balcony scents mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed germination/serenity) tightens accumulatively via scent detection narrowing options to patient harmony; agency in observing/journaling forecloses force with cost of prior oversight. Escalation peaks in crack moment charging closure. Minor abstractness in village "collective shift."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of undercurrent wisdom emerges organically from scent realizations and seed, resonating in final image reweighting motion over stillness without moralizing. Subtext in journal's ancestral ties deepens patience motif. No thematic echo despite conceptual terms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with olfactory perceptual signature ("nose twitched; a new scent"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from turmoil to hush. Voice particular to herbalist sensitivity, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in sensory lines; minor paraphrase loops on "serenity"/"wisdom" in reflection but pattern-taught without obscuring closure. Varied syntax propels to seed crack image. Slight overwriting in metaphors like "tide's thought" contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh olfactory herbalist in treetop world transforms ambition trope via scent-driven wisdom; journal custom and corpse flower synthesize uniquely. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
