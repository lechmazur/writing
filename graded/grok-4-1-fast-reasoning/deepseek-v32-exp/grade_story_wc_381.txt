<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to hush the prophecy is consistent and solitary, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied struggle; ritual actions align without revealing flaws or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as hush density builds to on-page closure (prophecy silenced with felt ritual cost in final hush blanketing haven); oriented early, single scene fits defaults, but no distinct tightening beat narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brook and night integrate purposefully into ritual (energy merges with current), constraining action and mirroring hush; sensory selection reflects focus without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prophecy stake signaled early under accumulative lens, hush progresses to earned resolution, but escalation lacks one deepening reversal or option-narrowing to charge closure fully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Harmony vs. chaos theme emerges organically from hush motif shifting secrets to beauty; resonant final image reweights silence, but redundancy mutes ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical close-third POV stable with perceptual bias toward voids/silence; rhythmic texture modulates ritual intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Pervasive loops ("smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze" repeated across beats) and paraphrase redundancy dull propulsion; template cadence in descriptive runs obscures climax hush moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Origami crane hush ritual synthesizes fresh fantasy elements organically; gains traction via specific method, but repetitive motifs read as untransformed prompt checklist.</comment>
