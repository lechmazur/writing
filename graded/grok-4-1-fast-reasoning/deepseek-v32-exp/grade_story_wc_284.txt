<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via betrayal memory anchoring present descent, compelling higher-stakes delivery to Anya; micro-choices like tapping signal reveal "prudently daring" hierarchy. Interiority concrete in gloved hand on pillbox but slips to label-speak ("unused courage waits") without full embodied contradiction in peak wound moment. Anya's arc adds crucible pressure, her skepticism yielding earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: snow codes therefore descent/meeting, drive decipher therefore broadcast plan, agents therefore shot—tightening to transmission DC with Elias's wound as felt cost in final fall. Two-shard structure (bluff-cabin-bluff) transitions legible via codes; orientation anchored early ("Zephyr Bluff, mist coiling"). Closure Charged Poise in Elias's smile amid blood, reconfiguring redemption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist/snow bluff constrains descent and shields broadcast, charging final image; sensory hush (muffling sound/thought) mirrors internal caution, selective via spy bias (patterns only he reads). Tilt toward spring evolves from fragile hope to honoring sacrifice, tactile in drifts/ice. Spatial choreography clear across shards without white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver proof/expose conspiracy) signaled early, tightens causally via deciphered drive/closing agents to broadcast reversal; agency in plan/devise forces trade-off (return to bluff risks ambush). Cost legible in Elias wound/shot, charging poise; moral calculus (redemption vs. life) peaks authentically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of renewal via "fixing broken" emerges organically from drive transmission and courage awakening, subtext in pillbox bridge; final Anya cradling it offers resonant non-literal answer (faith restored amid loss). Avoids morals but borders overt in "where unused courage had waited, they had found it."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV, perceptual signature in spy-filtered codes/mist; voice texture poetic yet controlled ("silver hush muffling sound and thought"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I come alone... vouchsafe"), advances plot; rhythm modulates tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., pillbox opens to reveal drive amid explanation); rhythm varies, propulsion strong in descent beats. Minor overwrite in recurring "tilt toward spring"/hush (patterned but borders loop, -0.3); no closure artifacts, metaphors coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Snow codes/pillbox transform spy trope into redemptive quest; fresh synthesis of bluff acoustics for broadcast and "prudently daring" calculus feels organic. Risks poetic compression heightening stakes without gimmick; no template echoes, premise particularized via elements.</comment>
