<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to free creativity is consistent and rooted in hearing unspoken words, driving the core arc. Interiority shows conflict between noise and music but relies on labels like "shadowed rapture" over embodied contradiction in pivotal moments. Final change feels earned through celestial alignment, but lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from trapped silence to symphonic release via cosmic whispers. Orientation anchors Elara, archway, and moon phases early. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "creativity, like stardust, is eternal," reweighting premise with lingering fragility cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and orrery vividly constrain choices, serving as sanctuary and tool that charge the final harmony image. Sensory details (shimmering green lights, cold brass) selectively mirror internal rapture, filtered through celestial bias. Evolving environment integrates with action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early, escalates via textural density to star-tracing deepening that narrows options toward alignment. Agency in adjusting orrery forces renunciation of escape for harmony, with bittersweet cost felt in "shadowed rapture lingered." One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic alignment freeing creativity emerges organically from particulars like stardust and falling stars, culminating in resonant final image of dynamic peace. Subtext in unspoken words blending to symphony avoids morals, embracing fragile ambiguity. No thematic echo, but some platitude risk in "eternal, never lost."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature biased toward celestial idiom, modulating rhythm poetically. Lyrical compression purposeful and pattern-taught early, legible at closure. Minor overwriting drifts register slightly elevated, but diction fits moonstruck voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive motif phrasing ("unwritten calendar," "shadowed rapture," "remembered stardust") creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs, dulling propulsion in reflective beats. Template cadence in "She [traced/sang/understood]" runs erode density. Closure image clear despite overwriting; rhythm varies but lacks peak compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hearing cosmic whispers and orrery-tracing transforms mystic dreamer trope via specific stardust concept. Risk in heavy lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise on celestial harmony feels organic, though echoes familiar astral epiphany arcs.</comment>
