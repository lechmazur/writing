<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Skepticism constrains choices like dismissing legends yet pressing on amid clanking, with embodied drowsy alertness layering contradiction; final reverence earns change via discovery without unearned epiphany. Minor label-speak in "religiously skeptical" but actions reveal traits under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (cold air, clanking, radio snippets) builds to hush and CR closure where placing valve reconfigures ghost shift as trauma imprint with conceptual cost in "burden...finally released." Orientation anchored early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tunnel's silt, crumbling bricks, and glinting valve constrain discovery and charge final image of brighter headlamp on less dark path; sensory hierarchy (crunching boots, intensifying machinery) mirrors urgency without catalog. Micro-setting (valve on pipe stub) guides symbolic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swallowed truth) signaled early, deepens via radio confession tightening interpretive pressure under accumulative lens; agency in tuning and placing valve forecloses supernatural belief with reverence cost legible in "tunnel did not feel so heavy anymore."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory's physics emerges organically from particulars (phantom clanks ceasing post-confession), reweighting premise in CR ending image without moralizing; subtext in radio metaphors enriches ambiguity of truth's weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (rust over spirits); distinct texture in syntax like "razor-sharp" drowsy alertness modulates intensity. No dialogue; rhythmic control heightens hush moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensory, interiority without loops; rhythm varies to propel from clanking buildup to "profound hush." Minor overwriting in repeated "weight/swallowed truth" motif stays purposeful for theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost lore via radio-confession physics of regret transforms tropes; valve's beaded grip and tunnel reprise feel inevitable, with risk in skeptical arc heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
