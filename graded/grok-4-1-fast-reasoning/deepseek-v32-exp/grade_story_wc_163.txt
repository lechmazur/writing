<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in belonging intensifies through feather discovery and light sightings, compelling exploration; interiority embodied in pocketed feather warming; earned change via cycle realization, but epiphanies verge on overt articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (feather, datapads, underwater fireflies) deepen anticipation to CR closure; orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in reconfiguration of belonging beyond place.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent ocean floor and facility creaks constrain exploration and charge final sunrise image; sensory details (humming generators, pulsing lights) selective via astrologer bias; micro-setting (observation deck) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via feather/logs/lights sighting that narrows isolation; agency in adjusting equipment and exploring; cost felt in foreclosed geographic fixation, charging epiphany image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as rhythmic moments emerges organically from firefly memory, feather cycle, and light swarm; resonant non-literal answer in heartbeat sync with deep pulse; minor thematic echo in final realization line slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with astrologer perceptual signature (celestial patterns on ruins); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to tranquil; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in discovery beats, varied rhythm; minor overwriting with repeated "shadowseam wonder" and paraphrase loops in epiphany (e.g., belonging rhythm restated thrice); no closure-dulling artifacts, but elevated diction drifts in reflections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of landscape astrology in underwater ruins with synthetic feather tying failure-to-hope cycle; risk-taking in coined "shadowseam wonder" heightens tone without gimmickry; turns inevitable from particulars.</comment>
