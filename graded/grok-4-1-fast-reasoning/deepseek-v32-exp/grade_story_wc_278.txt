<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to hush guilt roots consistently in her neglectful past and intensifies via translated cries into weeping action. Interiority embodies remorse concretely through tattooing under firmware resistance. Final endurance of "dull ache" earns closure with visible emotional cost, though epiphanies border tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from letters/amber discovery to sound-tattoo integration, holding to RR closure. Orientation anchors lab/Elara/echoes early. Cost legible in "weight lift... dull ache she could carry," with time folds constraining tactics; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lab's "meteor hush" and soundboards constrain tattooing choices, charging final glowing constellations. Sensory hush hums purposefully, mirroring internal states via distorted wails. Amber as micro-setting evolves tactilely from pulse to monument.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt dissonance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via firmware lashes and time-fold glimpses narrowing to amber merge. Agency in resonator connection forecloses chaos path with arduous resistance cost. Escalation driven by her micro-choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tethering guilt to forgiveness emerges organically from cry-translation and sound-constellations, reweighting past neglect in final lullaby image without moralizing. Amber's shift from prison to monument offers resonant non-literal answer. Complexity lingers in accepted ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters sounds/stars through tattooist lens, with rhythmic poetic texture modulating from dissonance to hush. Voice specificity in "mapping stars on skin" persists under stress. No head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density weaves action/image without loops, though minor "guilt" repetition purposeful for accumulative texture. Rhythm varies read-aloud, propelling from "frayed threads" to final "meteor hush persists." No filter stacks or muddled metaphors touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-translation, sound-tattoos, and amber frequency transforms guilt trope into bold redemption arc. Amber's "silent scream" vessel and time-fold tethers feel inevitable, risking poetic conceit that heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
