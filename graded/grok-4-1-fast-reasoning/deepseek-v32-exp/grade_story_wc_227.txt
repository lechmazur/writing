<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in traits like uncertainty shown in pacing and trembling fingers, compelling dive choice; embodied dread in stinging eyes and screaming lungs adds particularity. Internal conflict emerges in frantic precision vs. corrosion threat, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance earned but borders on tidy heroism without sharper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via progressive pockmark matches increasing memory quilt; orientation anchored early in workshop-sea setup. On-page closure as RR via final pulse solidifying memories with exhaustion cost legible in collapse and gasp. Single tightening in statue crumbling suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid sea and statue pockmarks constrain choices vividly—corrodes flesh/eyes, limits breath, demands precise alignment under pressure. Sensory narrowing to stinging burn and glowing response reflects urgency; workshop gears strain causally with waves. Recurring statue charges final pulse image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend memories vs. oblivion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via breath countdown and crumbling statue narrowing options. Agency in repeated alignments/narration drives escalation; cost visible in physical dissolution threat and workshop groans. Climax pressure coherent without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from golden light stitching pockmarks/memories, reweighting oblivion premise via quilt image. Subtext in resistance of acid vs. narration implies complexity without moralizing; final glowing charm offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids tidy binaries, embracing fragile repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual bias toward alchemical wonder/dread; diction like "seething green-tinged waters" yields distinct texture. Rhythm modulates from whirring anticipation to frantic underwater compression. No head-hopping or withholding; perceptual signature biases to pockmarks/charm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines integrating action/sensory (e.g., "bubbles carrying words"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Repetitive "quilt"/"kintsugi" motifs purposeful but verge on loop in late beats (−0.4); minor paraphrase in memory-stitching summaries dulls peak slightly. Closure image clear, no artifacts touching it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acid-sea alchemy and pockmark decoding transforms tropes into specific memory-mending logic; statue-charm alignment feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky dire-enchantment tone heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity in kintsugi-for-memories.</comment>
