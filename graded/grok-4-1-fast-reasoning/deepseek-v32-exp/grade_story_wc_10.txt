<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions in heat-map colors (scarlet fear, azure sorrow) reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final endurance of trauma feels earned through mapping process. Minor slip in tidy epiphany ("purpose: to reveal beauty") borders diagnostic without full cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from fork strikes to full tapestry; on-page Conceptual Repricing in "silence, once a curse, had become her instrument" reconfigures premise with undeniable emotional cost of endured trauma. Orientation anchored early in conservatory post-Quietening; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Winterglass lattice and frost-etched flora constrain choices via silence-enabling glass for heat-mapping; final image of shimmering imprints on glass charges closure as stage. Sensory selection (frozen breath, cool metal) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, deepens via trauma mapping that narrows to violet gratitude under Accumulative lens; one decisive cadence shift forces stance crystallization with visible emotional price in harmonized pain. Agency in repeated strikes alters tactics coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence as canvas emerges organically from heat-map symphony and unshaken flora mirroring endurance; final tapestry image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting trauma without moralizing. Complexity lingers in persistent pain beneath harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature biased to visual vibrations (ripples of gold) and silence-depth; rhythm modulates from process to charged poise at end. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in repetitive "rectify" (4x) and "unshaken marvels" (3x) create mild synonym churn dulling mid-density; strong rhythmic variety elsewhere, but overwriting in reflective summaries ("not void, but a canvas") drags propulsion. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Quietening visual music via dyes on ice transforms silence trope through specific heat-map mechanics and trauma calculus; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative design heightens stakes inevitably toward CR closure.</comment>
