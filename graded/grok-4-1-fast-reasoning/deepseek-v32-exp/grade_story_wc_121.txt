<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to conquer self clear and intensifies through rune choices facing reflections, but internal conflict summarizes contradictions ("trap, a distraction") rather than embodying simultaneous impulses; earned change at integration feels solid yet borders on unearned epiphany in "to simply be."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of generated paths and visions tightening to central platform; on-page RR closure via timeline stitching with legible pain cost ("each integration felt like a part of him dying"); orientation anchored early in viaduct/rain setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viaduct's glow/shadows and raindrops constrain leaps and charge final stabilization image; sensory selection purposeful (shimmering stones, abyss reflections) mirroring turmoil without overt symbolism; body/setting integration via weightless gliding evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-integration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening visions/selves to platform; agency in rune-tracing/leaping forecloses cycle with painful cost legible on climax page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of unity amid fracture emerges organically from reflection integrations and final wholeness; resonant non-literal answer in stabilized glow/rain cessation reweights defiance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in rune pulses/timeline echoes; rhythmic poetic texture modulates pressure effectively; minor register elevation in abstract realizations slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("retraced," "procedural generation," "labyrinth of self") creates paraphrase loops across beats, dulling density; rhythm varies but template echoes ("He focused... The rune flared") trigger −0.5 in mid-story; closure image propels cleanly despite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural generation in self-labyrinth transforms timeline tropes via tablet/viaduct logic; risk-taking in darkening brightness tone heightens stakes organically to unified close.</comment>
