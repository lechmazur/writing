<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via heartbeat sync, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; traits like grace shown through actions yet feel declarative without complicating flaws or visible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to mirrors rippling and first shimmer ("a child laughing"), closure as Charged Poise in "mirages held for a breath longer... fading back" with legible transient cost; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prism parapet as palette constrains light-guiding choices and charges mirage image; sensory details (rainbow flickers, jasmine scent, damp stone) integrated purposefully, mirroring internal potential without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (persuade mirrors) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via song phrases tightening to crescendo and mirror-by-mirror response, narrowing to bell-forced trade-off with on-page transience cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of transient possibilities emerges organically from song-weaving and fading mirages; final image ("promise on the echoing terrace") offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/hue noticing; voice lyrical and biased toward potential, but minor register elevation in abstracts slightly dulls peak immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence ("Lyra’s [trait]", e.g., "Lyra’s motivation... grace... perceptive calm") across 12+ instances creates paraphrase loops dulling propulsion; synonym churn on hush/parapet heaviest pre-closure, with figurative density overwriting high-pressure hum/climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirage-painting via coded songs transforms illusion trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable transient closure without gimmickry.</comment>
