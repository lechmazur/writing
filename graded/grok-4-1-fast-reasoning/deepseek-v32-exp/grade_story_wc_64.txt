<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in curiosity intensifies credibly through discoveries, compelling the final commitment to carry the torch; embodied actions like fingers tracing threads reveal character under pressure. Internal conflict mild with few contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Epiphany at journal discovery feels slightly unearned in phrasing like "Its author had intended," leaning toward summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as decoding density builds to CR closure: map reveals web of intentions, reconfiguring Elara's purpose with conceptual cost of inheriting the mission. One tightening via snapped thread pays off hidden compartment. Orientation anchored early in cemetery/silo; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo's rough-hewn shelves and cobalt under stars constrain work and charge final exit image, evolving from gloom to purposeful light. Sensory details like velveteen gloom integrate purposefully through POV. Spatial choreography clear on dusty crate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode intentions/echoes) signaled early tightens accumulatively via journal/map revelations, narrowing to generational web with agency in persistent decoding. Felt cost in urgency post-chess and mission inheritance legible at "she must continue." One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-legacy emerges organically from tapestry particulars, culminating in resonant CR: echoes charted etch into heart without moralizing. Final image reweights endings-as-doors motif non-literally. Complexity lingers in human desires' web.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (pulsing threads, velveteen embrace); voice modulates softly with intensity. No dialogue. Some diction repetition borders uniformity but supports texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in decoding beats (e.g., repeated "untangled," "patterns began to emerge," "frayed threads") and synonym churn on echoes/intentions dull propulsion across middle. Read-aloud rhythm varies but template stems like "She [action]" recur. Closure image clear despite artifacts; density functional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery lore with sovereign case/tapestry decoding transforms ghost-story tropes into memory-weaving legacy. Map web as intentions' shape offers non-obvious turn grounded in prior threads. Bold poetic risk heightens without gimmick.</comment>
