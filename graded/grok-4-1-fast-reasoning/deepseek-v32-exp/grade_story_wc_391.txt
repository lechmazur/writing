<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to sculpt patience drives embodied micro-choices like breathing to shape impatience; internal conflict acts in scene. Figures emerge but lack crucible pressure. Repetitive trait phrasing slightly dulls distinction without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from solo prep to moon convergence, gathering, nod signaling unyoke as RR/Charged Poise. Closure lands on-page with cost in foreclosed hurried lives, legible in "chain of quiet decisions that had finally broken the old yoke."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viaduct damp from rain handled tactilely constrains alignment choice; frozen lake as recurring mirror charges final image of "new stillness." Sensory selection purposeful, POV-filtered by vigilance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient revolution signaled early; accumulative deepening from personal centering to collective alignment narrows to intentional path. Cost felt in releasing "old fears and hurried lives" at nod climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of patience from impatience emerges organically via cycles and unyoke; final image over lake offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Repetitive phrasing like "patient revolution" risks overt statement, diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of measured vigilance; rhythmic prose modulates calmly. No dialogue. Repetition converges texture slightly under collective peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("patient revolution" x5, "unyoke" x6, "tracking moon paths" x3) and template cadence (e.g., "She [action], [abstract trait].") pervade, dulling propulsion; artifacts touch closure recap in final para.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-tracked viaduct ritual for spiritual unyoking transforms quiet revolution trope. Risk in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes organically. Premise feels inevitable via particulars like lodestone quiver.</comment>
