<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as aesthetically driven boundary-crosser, shown in hand on pillar and paraphrasing; interiority concrete via vibrations in bones and tremor. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with epiphanies like "beauty lies not in permanence, but in change" feeling declarative rather than earned through struggle. Final change from observer to agent credible but lacks visible cost scaled to flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hand on pillar to walls wavering, stepping through, worlds merging. Orientation anchored early (poet to atrium by lake post-ban). Closure as Charged Poise in final image of thawing lake and blending shadow reconfigures limits with conceptual cost of new boundaries forming, legible in "new ones would form, and he would be there to paraphrase them too."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: hum vibrates bones, ice cracks, frost touches floor, mirroring dissolution. Setting constrains via colonnade as key to entry and guides choices (approaches, places hand, crosses). Recurring quartz and cobalt pool charge final image, with lake thaw evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stride through sacred boundaries) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as paraphrasing blurs walls and merges realms, narrowing options. Agency in speaking and stepping forecloses isolation with felt cost in lingering tremor. Escalation driven by poet's actions under lens; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in change emerges organically from dissolving imagery and realization, without statement. Final image of thawing lake and blending shadow offers resonant reconfiguration of permanence vs. flux. Subtext in tremor shifts doubt to truth, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: aesthetic bias in noticing "lantern-moth hush," cloud-shadows, cobalt glow. Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, compression purposeful and pattern-taught. No head-hopping; diction biased and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies poetically, density high with multi-job lines; sensory propulsion strong. Paraphrase loops ("paraphrased... paraphrase... paraphrasing") across middle create minor redundancy without obscuring cause (deduct -0.6). Closure image clear, no figurative muddle there; scaffold minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic boundary-dissolution in fantastical quartz/cobalt world, transforming limits trope via paraphrasing mechanic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Turn at merging worlds feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
