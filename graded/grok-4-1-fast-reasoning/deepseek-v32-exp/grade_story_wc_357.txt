<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's pilot traits shine in steady hands and micro-choices like cutting the engine amid inversion, rooting motivation in resilience quest; embodied reactions (stomach lurch) add specificity. Limited internal contradiction or flaws weaken depth—no contradictory impulses act in peak cavern beat. Endurance of knowledge gain feels earned but lacks visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (arrow tip, water nav) build density to cavern CR closure, where echoes disperse as felt cost of time. Orientation anchored early (Veridia, inversion). Single tightening via tip's pull suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches, inverted water ribbon, glowing moss constrain choices (nav through canyon, timed entry) and charge final dispersal image. Sensory hierarchy (pilot notes groves, quartz gleam) filters via urgency. Recurring water evolves causally, mirroring internal pull.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source hunt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via water-led discovery narrowing options under hour clock. Agency in steering/following tip forecloses drift paths; inversion end as cost legible in slowing spiral. No reversals needed; pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resilience as dynamic echoes-process emerges via seedling growth and visions, not statement; arrow tip shifts from relic to key, reweighting past-future in final securing. Subtext in wonder vs. documentation tension lingers ambiguously. Final image answers quest non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with pilot perceptual bias (scanning groves, feeling tip hum). Prose rhythm modulates (short lurch sentences, flowing drifts); diction purposeful (bio-luminous, quartz-embedded). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density in integrated sensory propulsion (e.g., "curling upwards like a silver ribbon"); varied rhythm avoids monotony. Minor paraphrase loops ("whirling silence" repeats x3 without payoff) dulls slightly, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity-flip orchards + echo-archive + arrow-key transforms wonder tropes organically. Risky inversion window heightens stakes; final "piloted onward, guided by water and wonder" feels inevitable. No derivative echoes.</comment>
