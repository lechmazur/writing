<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority particular and embodied, rooting motivation to certify wonder; micro-choices like positioning under ice window reveal values under anticipation. Minimal contradictory impulses limit to strong rather than exceptional; no visible flaws complicating peak release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to on-page RR (amber sheet dissolves into "river of audible color," sheet inert); cost legible in transformed hush and continued vigil. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern sensory-specific (refracted light, natural window constraining aurora entry); charges closure as walls "glow with residual colors." POV bias via synesthesia filters details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfetter wonder) tightens accumulatively via aurora arrival and bell-ringing fusion; agency in precise motions forecloses prior dormancy with sheet's inert cost. Sculptor sync complicates via synergy without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's essentiality emerges via particulars (trapped hues freed); final image reweights premise non-literally as hush "remembers and cherishes song." No moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing vigil lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature distinct (chimes as "cascade of color"); rhythmic modulation builds to peak ("surge of joy as... tapestry of emotions"). Stable close third-person limited, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric repetition (hush, repose as motifs); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops dulling closure. Minor overwrite in descriptive runs pre-climax risks muddle but stays legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Synesthesia-aurora fusion transforms tropes organically; chisel sync offers fresh inflection on creation's dawn. Irreplaceable premise synthesis inevitable at "synergy resonated... notes dissolved."</comment>
