<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's involuntary truthfulness compels riddle recitation and honest insight, driving the inciting handoff to Kael and climax action; motivation to preserve wonder aligns actions but relies on summary labels like "her motivation clear" rather than deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via riddle interpretation therefore simulated rain on rods yielding DC closure (lights flicker on) with felt cost in climb and fragile wonder; orientation anchored immediately in tower amid blackout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower's spine and rods constrain summit choices, charging final thrum; nectar-dusk hues and honey scent filter through Elara's priorities, evolving with residual hum to restored buzz.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore power via riddle to preserve wonder) tightens causally from interpretation to enactment, narrowing options with agency in recitation and spraying; cost legible in urgent climb and potential failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Wonder in routine emerges organically via riddle solution but diluted by explicit articulations like "It was the wonder that saved us," echoing thesis without full subtext layering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward wonder (nectar-dusk recurring); dialogue distinct and goal-driven (Kael's grim report prompts truthful reveal), modulating rhythm under rising energy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ending paraphrase loops on box closing and wonder preservation (multiple "closed," "wonder remained") create redundancy across final paragraphs, dulling closure propulsion despite vivid sensory integration elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone beehives, lightning tower, and riddle-in-matchbox transforms blackout trope into wonder-preserving causal arc, with risk-taking world logic inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
