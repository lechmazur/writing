<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots consistently in ancestor honor, shown through steady hands vs. voice tremor; contradictory dread/confidence acts in scene via unpacking and questioning Roy. Final presentation choice earned by prior discoveries with emotional cost. Minor label-speak ("nervously confident") slightly genericizes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain solid: journal decoding → data cross-reference → question to Roy → dive → retrieval → exoneration as DC. Orientation anchored early ("remote experimental weather station"). Closure cost legible in "dread receding" after "profound peace"; lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station's probes constrain dive choice; alarms and storm mirror/pressure internal dread, evolving with events. Nail as micro-setting charges final image ("copper nail in hand"). Sensory selective (whirring, thin air, glint).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse exile) signaled early, tightens via journal proof → dive coordination narrowing options. Agency in questioning Roy forces probe access with dread cost. Escalation causal, storm complicates climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of buried truth vs. justice emerges via coded stanzas and nail retrieval; final "winds... new tune" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in Roy's suspicion to intrigue. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (dread as "spongey"); voice modulates rhythm in stress ("frantic energy"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Will you now revoke...?"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("nervously confident," "spongey dread" x3 each) creates minor motif but paraphrase-loop feel in emotional beats, dulling propulsion. Density strong otherwise; rhythm varies. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coded stanzas hiding nav data and "copper nail from coffin" literalized ingeniously into wreck retrieval transforms ancestry trope. Fresh synthesis of weather station + submerged history.</comment>
