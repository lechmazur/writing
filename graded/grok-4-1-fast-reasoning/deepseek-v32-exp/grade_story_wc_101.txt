<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to build intergenerational support is consistent and intensifies through actions like organizing runs and culminating in the declaration, earning the closure choice. Interiority feels concrete in sensory ties to the bell and arbor, with gentle persistence embodied rather than purely labeled. Limited internal contradiction keeps it from higher bands, though micro-choices under sanctions pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ritual runs to declaration's Charged Poise, reconfiguring survival into future-building with felt communal cost in "bonds fortified." Single continuous scene adheres to defaults with one tightening at the arbor speech. Orientation anchors early (Elara at arbor, moon rise); closure cost legible in resolved breaths and cycle of generosity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and silver bell function as micro-settings, constraining choices (parcels at base, declarations beneath arches) and charging the final image. Sensory details like "humid night air" and "dusty path" filter through Elara's priorities, evolving with runs. Ridge and moon provide purposeful atmosphere mirroring quiet defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival-to-support signaled early via runs; declaration tightens under Accumulative lens, narrowing endurance into proactive resolve. Pressure from sanctions and anonymity coheres but remains abstract, lacking visceral on-page test like a failed drop. Cost felt in shift but not trade-off heavy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet defiance through persistence emerges organically from runs, bell chimes, and elder-youth bonds, resonating in final image without moralizing. Subtext in anonymous cycle enriches without assertion. Declaration offers non-literal answer to sanctions' oppression via "legacy... eternal."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with perceptual bias toward symbols like bell; voice texture consistent in rhythmic, hushed lyricism matching tone. Sparse dialogue natural and goal-pursuing ("We must be swift"). Cross-cap from Q7 limits higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("amplified quiet" x3, "gently persistent," "midnight food runs," "anonymous donations") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence, dulling density in reflective beats. Minor scaffold in redundant bell-ringing descriptions drags propulsion. Rhythm varies but overwriting in final third harms closure image clarity; −1.2 total artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual objects (bell, arbor) and exile uplift transforms tropes via textured defiance. Declaration turn feels earned from particulars, avoiding generic survival tale. Familiar communal resolve tempers boldness.</comment>
