<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's grief embodied concretely in "hands too heavy with grief to lift a hammer," motivation intensifies via clue trail to compel creation; final change earned without safety-hedging. Minor diagnostic label-speak in repeated "subdued ardor" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: origami pattern taught early accumulates to stencil revelation as tightening, yields CR closure in final stencil-lamp image reweighting grief cycle with felt past cost. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Timeless observatory specific and purposeful: dome shaft illuminates stencil pivotally, constraining entry via "curtains of intention"; recurs to charge final open-curtains image. Sensory selection POV-biased toward grief tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief to renewal) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via clue density to agency in crafting/sharing; one tightening at stencil narrows to transformation path with visible cost of prior rock bottom. Closure Charged Poise legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-cycle emerges organically from rose stencil/parting curtains; resonant final image reconfigures mourning. Weakened by final-paragraph moralizing ("grief was not a full stop, but a comma") replacing image pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV third-limited with perceptual signature (star/grief metaphors); rhythmic modulation under discovery beats. Brief visitor dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("subdued ardor" x4, "withering to bloom" x3, "genuinely artificial" x2) create template cadence in final third, dulling closure propulsion; paraphrase redundancy in ending summaries (e.g., multiple origami/coordinates restatements). Density solid otherwise, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami treasure hunt in observatory for grief renewal transforms mourning tropes; risk in "genuinely artificial" stencil as truthful pivot feels organic. Transformation test passes: elements interdependent.</comment>
