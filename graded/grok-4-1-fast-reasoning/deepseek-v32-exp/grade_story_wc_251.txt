<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to plant forests of second thoughts roots consistently in her chess coaching and ability to hear unspoken words, compelling micro-choices like the ritual cradling. Interiority feels embodied through whispers swelling and soul-pull in the grotto. Flawless arc to humble success, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from grotto retrieval to displays igniting and forests sprouting. Closure as CR in "forests of second thoughts grew deep and enduring," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of elusive leadership. One tightening via synchronized bloom suffices; orientation anchored early in library/grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto constrains retrieval and amplifies intentions, charging final queen-cradle reprise. Mist curls protectively, cobalt walls shimmer purposefully through POV bias. Sensory selection (glistening minerals tugging) mirrors internal resolve without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of humble rebellion signaled early; escalation via accumulative density of displays (eye, seed, roots) forces guard's softening and Council's bafflement. Agency in window arrangement forecloses violent paths with felt humility cost. One deepening reweights doubt as forests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of gentle persuasion emerges organically from pawn/queen progression and seed-to-forest symbols shifting meaning. Final image of glowing windows offers non-literal answer to prophecy without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like unspoken hope buzzing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in whispered unspoken words and chess metaphors. Poetic diction ("amplified quiet") modulates rhythmically, distinct from sparse dialogue. No head-hopping; voice coheres under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (cradle, forests) as motif, but minor paraphrase loops in "unspoken words" and "amplified quiet" across beats dull propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no heavy artifacts touching closure. Overwriting in perpetual mist metaphors subtracts minimally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess rebellion via lodestone pieces and window symphonies transforms tropes organically. Window constellation igniting feels inevitable from grotto pull. Risky lyric accumulation heightens subtle stakes without gimmick.</comment>
