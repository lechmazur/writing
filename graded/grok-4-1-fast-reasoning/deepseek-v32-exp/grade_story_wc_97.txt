<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's steely longing is embodied through piano play and film threading, with contradictory melancholy-to-wild shift earned in the ballroom climax. Strategic creativity enables the chord-door interaction without label-only flaws. Final encore renunciation of past forecloses regret path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arbor instability to film anomalies, culminating in Charged Poise RR as music solidifies refuge with brief-peace cost legible in clock's new time. Orientation anchored early in pianist-arbor setup. One tightening via compass flare narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal arbor flora pulses constrain escape timing, mirroring internal longing; mist curtain as screen enables projector door. Final ballroom piano recharges prior motifs. Sensory selection (light ebb, whirring projector) narrows with urgency, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refuge before storm) signaled early, tightens via compasses flaring to force film threading under Textural lens. Agency in theorized projector-chord convergence forecloses arbor path with time cost. Escalation density charges ballroom image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of creative defiance emerges organically from film-memory doorways and encore rewriting fate, reweighting past fracture without statement. Final monochrome ballroom offers non-literal answer via clock shift. Resonance from particulars avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (traces canister amid pulsing light) and rhythmic modulation under stress. Prose texture distinct in syntax like "sky bled from silver to deep orange." No head-hopping; voice coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in projector whir-to-door beat; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in arbor metaphors ("pulsed with rhythmic light") slightly blurs peak entry but doesn't dull closure image. Clean propulsion to final note.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Film-reel doorways and piano-light interaction synthesize memory refuge ingeniously, transforming tropes via arbor physics. Unplanned encore turn feels inevitable from theorized anomalies. Bold premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
