<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's feisty persistence and softening via journal insight show contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning the reunion choice with relational cost. Interiority concrete but edges into label-speak like "feisty determination." Lyra's brief appearance applies closing pressure without diluting Elara's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from bag discovery to journal realization and offering, culminating in CR closure via Lyra's dawn return with box and dialogue reweighting vows. Orientation anchored early in cathedral exile. One tightening via journal insight narrows stubborn stance; cost legible in weeks of persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard in rafters vividly sensory (apple bloom/decay scent, rustling whispers) and mirrors journey, constraining choices via crypt rubble, mossy altar. Evolves causally as Elara tends it. Recurring leaves charge final thriving image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite/bridge wisdom) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via journal epiphany forcing stance shift from imposition to listening. Agency in crafting/offering forecloses isolation path; reunion cost felt in prior rift and dew-blended tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Deciduous vows theme emerges organically from journal/particulars, resonant in ribbon retied and sap-flow image without overt moral. Lyra's closing line "I read about deciduous vows" borders thematic echo, slightly undercutting subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (rustling as secrets, tactile ribbon). Voice modulates rhythmically; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Mother... old promises had to fall away"). No head-hopping; diction fits craftswoman.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "persist" and "accidental wisdom" across beats dull propulsion slightly. No closure artifacts; metaphors consistent (leaves/vows). Opening anchors stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quartz mending, rafter orchard, deciduous vows transforms exile trope into renewal beacon. Risky cathedral orchard heightens ingenuity without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight via bag's unintended pivot.</comment>
