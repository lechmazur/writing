<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through jar-capturing process, rooted in past loss; interiority embodied in trembling hands and humming counter-melody. Minor slips in alternating summary ("This act was more than preservation") dilute contradictory impulses under pressure. Earned change at "felt a shift within" ties to prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from music box whir to jar arrangement, cadence shift at "arranged the jars in a semicircle." Closure as Charged Poise/CR in packing satchel and walking out reconfigures identity with felt personal cost. Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via spiritual sweetening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Feral loft and dunes vividly sensory (salt-crusted air, sunlight through cracks), constrain isolation and charge final image of empty loft as "library of captured moments." Details filter through poet's priorities, mirroring redemption arc without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (jars, music box) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via preservation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through repeating captures and trembling hands narrowing to spiritual infusion. One deepening (humming counter-melody) forces trade-off, cost legible in "weight of his quest" charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of preservation/redemption emerges organically from jar actions and final image of "pocket full of captured dawns," reweighting past regrets without moralizing. Subtext in imagined future souls adds resonance; no tidy resolution, embraces ambiguity of personal atonement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (wistful, sound-focused noticing); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in dawn light descriptions. Elevated diction fits bardic poet without register drift; purposeful compression in repetitive motifs taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops (redemption/regret phrasing repeated in ending: "gleaned redemption... atonement") and synonym churn ("sweeten... enriching... warmth") dull density in final third. Rhythm varies but overwriting in metaphors ("tapestry of peace") risks muddle under reflective pressure. Propulsion strong overall, no grammar issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-jarring as redemption tool transforms vagrant trope; dunes loft and music box yield memorable perspective. Risky lyric accumulation heightens isolation stakes organically; no derivative echoes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
