<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unravel time's texture drives consistent micro-choices like adjusting the maze layout under vision pressure. Interior conflict embodied in "drowning in yesterday's echoes" and unalterable observations shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final realization earned by prior causal buildup of geometric interventions, foreclosing past immersion with felt memory loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from visions to maze adjustments, fractal realization, rumble, and disintegration RR (Charged Poise) with legible cost in receding visions and inert fragment. Single scene anchored early in garden with halo. One tightening via "channeling the maze's geometric paradoxes" narrows options purposefully. Closure image of dim fragment and new bridge reconfigures time's weave undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hyperbolic maze and living bridges constrain choices, as Elara adjusts folds to twist space and channel energy toward climax. Sensory details like "air hummed with a quaking reverie" and "faint scent of blooming jasmine" filter through her geometric/time-obsessed POV, evolving with events (vines unraveling). Final garden's "paths unfolding into futures" charges image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break retrocognitive trap) signaled early; textural escalation deepens via intensifying visions, layout changes, and willful channeling that fractures hold. Agency in "determined hands... adjusted the maze's layout" forces trade-off, with cost in dissolving visions/photographs viscerally felt. Pressure coheres to reweight stake without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of time as fractal tapestry emerges organically from maze design, visions, and disintegration, reweighting linear trap into woven possibilities. Final image of thriving maze and reaching vines offers non-literal answer without moralizing, lingering via lost past's essence. Subtext in unalterable observations vs. transformative action avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in geometric/textural noticing ("curves defied Euclidean limits," "texture of time etched into her soul"). Prose texture modulates rhythmically from humming tension to peaceful cadence, matching emotional arc. No elision issues; voice confident within Elara's lexicon, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere; rhythm varies with scene (short punchy disintegration sentences amid poetic flow). Minor paraphrase loops in time/weave motifs and synonym churn ("dissolving," "receding," "vanished") dull some propulsion without obscuring closure (-0.6). No filter stacks or template cadence; metaphors consistent if elevated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, retrocognition, and living maze transforms time-travel trope into textural quest. Risky poetic structure heightens stakes via fractal realization driving disintegration. Core premise commits fully, with halo/maze particulars making reconfiguration inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
