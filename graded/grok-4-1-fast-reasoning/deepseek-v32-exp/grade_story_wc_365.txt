<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "sharp and persistent thorn" intensifies credibly to compel weaving under time pressure from cyclical power. Interiority concrete via sensory mapping but slips into abstract "weight" labels over embodied contradiction in visions. Final realization earned by prior causal buildup, confronting flaw of withheld truth with felt cost in "aching silence," though epiphany borders unearned without deeper irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via surging perceptions holds to CR closure: truth unfolds as sensation with undeniable conceptual cost in "heavier than any metal, yet lighter than a breath." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening at rift stabilizes chaos into coherent stream. Cost legible in shard cooling and power ebbing, foreclosing unstable weaving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective: "derelict starship skeletons" and "residual power as anchor" constrain weaving tactics, charging final image of shard in dust. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hum only he feels); gravel crunch grounds body in spaceport. Mirrors internal desolation evolving to silence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled in opening origins secret; Accumulative escalation via density surge to rift forces stance crystallization in stabilizing act. Agency in "delicate work of weaving" narrows options with visible cost of fleeting cycle. Moral calculus in love's sacrifice sharpens peak without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial love's weight emerges organically from visions and "crushing...burden chosen to protect," reweighting withheld truth premise in final image. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "woven into the very map of his being." Protagonist arc inextricable from conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: sensory biases like "intangible echoes" and intuitive dance distinguish voice. Prose texture modulates rhythm with pressure, compressing at rift; diction controlled and POV-apt. No head-hopping; elisions purposeful in multiverse glimpses, paid off in revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops on "murmur of dreams" and "weight" across beats dull ~2% momentum without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies purposefully, peaking at rift; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors in climax. Zero scaffold; figurative consistent in sensory mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping and multiverse weaving transforms tropes via "pull threads from adjacent realities," inevitable in hindsight from map maker trait. Risky CR closure heightens stakes organically; no hedging, commits to premise without retreat. Transformation test passes: core arc hinges on specific profession-world logic.</comment>
