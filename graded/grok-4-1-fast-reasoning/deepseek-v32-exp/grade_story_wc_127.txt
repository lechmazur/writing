<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to fuse insight with empathy is told early but feels diagnostic and unearned; epiphany at "half truths had been a cage" lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, relying on summary over micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sensory residues to RR closure via dropped petal; cost legible in "discarded relic of her past," but repetitive "transformation completed" muddies tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amber grotto vividly anchors with glowing walls and pulsing warmth mirroring internal shift; static crackle and dusk light constrain perception and charge final image as witness/catalyst.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (counterfeit vs. genuine emotion) tightens via inhalation contrasting hollow joy with real sorrow, forcing agency in dropping petal; cost felt in foreclosed deceit path under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of fabrication-to-authenticity emerges organically via blotter's arc to dust; resonant CR in final harmony image, but late paragraphs verge on articulating thesis over implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in static-sensing and thorough analysis; rhythmic prose modulates from detached observation to empathetic surge without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("transformation completed" x4, "static electricity" churn, "subsume/fuse" repetition) and synonym redundancy pervade final third, dulling closure propulsion despite vivid sensory texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-based counterfeit emotions and static-sensing in surreal grotto transforms epiphany trope; irreplaceable surreal rules heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
