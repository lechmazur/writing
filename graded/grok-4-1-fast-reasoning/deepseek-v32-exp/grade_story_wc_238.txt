<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to deliver an imperfect apology drives consistent micro-choices, like deploying the perfume and device, with embodied grit in her "gritty" words during the connection; internal philosophy anchors traits without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to shimmering currents and apology, landing Charged Poise closure with "forgiven" blossom reconfiguring the haunting; orientation anchored early in archive and purpose; cost legible in orchard's impending doom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archive's aged paper/ink and stained windows constrain ritual via lectern and orchard view, charging final blossom entry; sensory hierarchy (scent, hum) reflects Elara's mystical-practical bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect for apology) signaled early tightens via currents' "tenuous thread" sparking sorrowful exchange; agency in device/perfume use forecloses haunting with imperfect cost as chainsaws dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles emerge organically from ritual's messy success, apple blossom reweighting gossip's scars without moralizing; resonance in lullaby shift answers closure question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (ethereal-grit diction like "paper ghosts"); rhythm modulates to terse climax ("Isabella," he whispered); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, sensory propulsion in "orange blossoms unfurled"; minor overwriting in opening descriptors ("cavernous room, shelves bowing") doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist premise ingeniously synthesizes rumor-hauntings with currents/perfume ritual, transforming ghost tropes via orchard's real-world doom; fresh "stuck records" metaphor risks bold grit.</comment>
