<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's warmly observant trait and motivation to discover time's texture drive concrete micro-choices like focusing on the hermit crab and cicada, earning the empathetic shift with Kael; contradictory impulses between direct confrontation and tangential patience act in scene. Minor slips in label-speak ("warmly observant nature") feel diagnostic without full embodiment. Final hand-taking reveals hierarchy of values with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds from tidal pools to cicada to dialogue, tightening to Charged Poise closure where pause transforms into emergence with felt shedding cost ("Not let go, but transform"). Orientation anchors early (grotto, stars, pools). One meaningful deepening via tangential method reweights stakes legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto and pools constrain tangential choices (Elara turns to water's edge), charging final image of glimmering pools as flux worlds; sensory hierarchy (gritty sand, fluid tide) reflects priorities. Hermit crab mirrors internal states purposefully. Spatial choreography coherent, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve leaving via understanding transition) signaled early, tightens texturally through deepening observations that force stance crystallization in dialogue ("waiting for our own emergence"); agency in patient attention forecloses avoidance path. Cost felt in Kael's mirrored fear and relational softening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as textured cycles emerges organically from cicada molt, crab shell, pools; final image (hand-taking under stars) offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in silence and implication enriches ambiguity of change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (layered observations like "strata in the grotto's walls"); dialogue natural, subtextual ("What do you see?"/"I see time"), advances plot. Minor register elevation in reflective prose, but rhythm modulates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("texture of time," "transition periods," "ancient grotto under stars") across multiple paragraphs dull density, with synonym churn (cycles, shedding, emergence) creating template cadence in reflective beats. Figurative density overwrites without full propulsion in peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler observing micro-transitions transforms change trope via jade cicada and pools; risk in tangential method heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
