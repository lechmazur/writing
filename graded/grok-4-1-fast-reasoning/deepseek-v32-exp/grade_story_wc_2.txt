<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in clock-tinkering precision vs. creeping unease intensifies compellingly through intuitive choices; contradictory impulses (rigid repair vs. improvised quest) act in pivotal finds like the key and compass. Interiority concrete and embodied in "unease had settled in her bones." Final transformation earned by prior causality, confronting flaw of fearing internal brokenness with felt cost of surrendering plans.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of coincidence-pattern builds via key, ashes-box, compass-guided tunnels to grotto CR closure, reweighting life's rule-set with conceptual cost legible in "beneath the ashes of her old self, a new resilience had kindled." Mosaic shards taught early by "coincidence becomes pattern," transitions legible, one tightening via compass spin suffices. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (greenhouse "perfume of rot," waterfall "mist painting rainbows," glowing moss carvings) filtered through tinkerer's mechanical gaze constrain choices (slipping on wet stone, brushing dirt). Waterfall and compass charge final image as micro-settings mirroring internal shift from order to flow. Spatial choreography coherent across shards; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriend uncertainty via intuition-guided quest) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through finds narrowing options to trust compass over plans; agency in improvising tunnels forecloses rigid path with cost (boots slipping, surrender to unknown). Escalation coheres under lens with cadence shift at grotto stance crystallization; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from coincidence-pattern and improvised finds, culminating in resonant CR: compass "not pointing to a place, but to a state of being" reweights prior clock-rigidity without moralizing. Carvings provide non-literal answer mirroring arc; ambiguity lingers in "uncertainly certain" without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: tinkerer's bias toward brass/gears in "flicker of brass," "delicate brass points." Prose texture rhythmic, modulates from whisper to thunder; purposeful poetic compression taught early legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but final recap ("The neglected greenhouse, the swirling leaves, the subterranean waterfall, the ashes") creates paraphrase loop dulling closure image (−0.6); minor template cadence in epiphanic sentences ("She understood," "She realized," "She had always"). Rhythm varies read-aloud; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms quest trope via tinkerer's precision-to-intuition arc and fate-compass leading to self-carvings mirror; risk in mosaic shards heightens accumulative stakes organically. Non-obvious grotto payoff inevitable from pattern; no derivative templates.</comment>
