<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied decryption of cast symbols reveals shrewdly innocent paradox under anesthetic pressure, earning cathartic shift; minor deduction for diagnostic labels like "lotus-hearted ache" bordering on therapy-speak in peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density-building decryption beats culminating in CR closure: final "two figures holding hands" reconfigures wounds into compassionate narrative with legible emotional cost ("old wounds... intertwined").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coral fragment as micro-setting constrains and charges closure ("felt lighter... testament to resilience"), filtering sensory details (vapor curling, bruised light) through translator's perceptual bias; vivid yet selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting meaning escalates accumulatively through symbol-by-symbol decryption narrowing to connection realization; agency in mental unknotting forecloses helplessness with felt chest warmth cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of translating silences/wounds emerges organically from cast decryption, resonant CR ending ("understanding itself is a form of action") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of syntactic metaphors ("grammar of peace"); rhythm modulates from drift to sharpened symbols under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density strong, but −0.6 for paraphrase loops ("shared anxieties" thrice) and figurative density (e.g., "cold tide... bruised purple") edging overwrite in decryption beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator decrypting war child's cast under anesthetic transforms trauma trope; coral reprise and lotus ache tone risk bold lyric internality heightening stakes organically.</comment>
