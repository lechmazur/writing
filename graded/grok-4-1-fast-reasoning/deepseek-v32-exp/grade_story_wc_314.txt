<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior conflict vividly embodied in hesitation ("logic dictated precise measurements, but intuition whispered") compelling the gentle flame micro-choice; final fusion feels earned with embodied emotion welling. Minor label-speak ("secretly sentimental") slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to on-page RR closure ("inner shift that fused her analytical mind with her heartfelt instincts"); crystal's thaw makes before/after legible with felt cost of prior division overcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall and starlings constrain insight via patterns mirroring sought balance; recurrent orchard details evolve causally (flowers bloom post-crystal drip), charging final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize logic/intuition) signaled early and tightens accumulatively through starlings-triggered memory to flame action; agency in gentle warming forecloses shattering option with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection over control emerges organically from particulars (grandmother's words via memory cue); final image reconfigures premise non-literally, though slight redundancy borders on stating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical close-third POV stable with biased perceptual signature (alchemical priorities filter sensory hierarchy); rhythmic modulation suits accumulative build, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn in final third ("harmony solidify... perfect blend... unified soul... become whole") dull closure propulsion; overwrought repetition obscures density despite vivid openings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh internal alchemy via nature metaphors transforms trope through specific sensory synthesis; risk in lyric accumulative mode heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
