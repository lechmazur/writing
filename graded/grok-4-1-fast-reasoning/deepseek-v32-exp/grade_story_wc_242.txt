<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to teach endings how to begin drives his micro-choices like spinning the disc faster, earning Elara's change and his endurance; interiority concrete via his isolation mirroring hers. Minor slip: Elara's grief leans toward stock phrasing without deeper contradiction until loop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: call → listening → loop deepens reflection, yielding Charged Poise closure in Elara's "Thank you" and Leo's backstory tie, with estrangement cost legible in final readiness image. Orientation anchored early in booth/tunnel; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Disc constrains choices (spinning initiates loop) and charges final image (rests ready); tunnel's rumble/breathing mirrors emotional heartbeat, sensory hierarchy via Leo's perceptual bias. Specificity vivid, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide via wrong number) tightens via loop reversal, narrowing Elara's overlooked joys with Leo's agency; cost felt in her silence/pain clarification and his isolation. Escalation coherent under textural lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of endings-as-beginnings emerges via loop's memory revisit, resonant in Elara's shift and Leo's past callback without moralizing; final disc image reweights estrangement as bridge. Subtext in accidental connections avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with melodic perceptual signature (haunted tones weaving grief); dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("wrong number" invitation). Rhythm modulates with disc's spin, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm supports propulsion; purposeful repetition (hum, disc whir) pattern-taught as textural motif without obscuring closure. Minor paraphrase loops ("cultivated estrangement," "haunting melody") deduct lightly, not touching peak loop beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass harmonica in phone booth transforms wrong-number trope into fresh estrangement engine; risk of poetic surrealism (loop as memory revisit) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via Leo's backstory close.</comment>
