<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's dry wit ("Glaciers make poor cartographers") and embodied chill from burden reveal particular interiority under pressure. Contradictory peace marred by nagging worry acts simultaneously at discovery. Final duty to document earns a credible endurance with felt cost of ephemeral truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (condensation, symbols, rivulets) builds to fissure discovery as Charged Poise. Orientation anchored early (outpost, lake, post-falcon). Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in "ephemeral nature of truth," reweighting quest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Condensation patterns constrain choice, guiding to lake center and fissure. Sensory hierarchy (traced moisture, steam curl) reflects editor's map-like perception. Evolving details (fissure warmth amid frost) mirror internal revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (river origins) signaled early, tightens via deciphering to outdoor action under accumulative lens. One deepening (droplets to rivulets mirroring tributaries) narrows to focal point. Agency in trudging to center forecloses doubt with visible cost of altered worldview.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of primordial pulse veiled by tranquility emerges from particulars like steam from stone reweighting "water has a memory." Final shifted patterns offer resonant ambiguity without moralizing. Nagging worry adds plausible counter-reading to epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (hydrographic parsing of droplets). Voice modulates rhythmically: short, intense sentences at fissure ("Steam curled... nascent stream"). Murmurs carry dry wit subtext without dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in pattern beats, but minor figurative pile-up ("linguistic thread weaving," "geothermal heart") risks coherence in revelation. Varied rhythm avoids monotony; no loops dull closure. Strategic telling compresses legend recall effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes atlas quest with condensation cartography into inevitable geothermal reveal. Transforms mythic origin trope via polyglot clues and falcon herald. Risky lyric accumulation on patterns heightens stakes organically.</comment>
