<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to nurture integrity drives consistent micro-choices like retrieving the pigeon and inviting the woman, with a credible shift from solitude to alliance earning the closure reconfiguration. Internal conflict between fear and curiosity acts in scene via lateral analysis over direct confrontation. Repetitive trait labels like "credibly curious" dilute embodied emotion slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of clues (pigeon, message, analysis, arrival) builds to Charged Poise closure in alliance formation with felt cost to solitude. Single scene anchors orientation early (courtyard, dusk, post-following). Minor summary of "following days" softens on-page decisiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Courtyard at dusk constrains choices as sanctuary invaded by pigeon and intruder, evolving from fragile peace to urgent haven and charging final enriched image. Sensory details (cool air, gloom, stars) selective via meteorological POV. Weather anomalies integrate purposefully into stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (verify falsified records amid pursuit fear) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via message revelation and woman's arrival narrowing solo path. Agency in collaboration forecloses isolation with legible relational cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of integrity thriving beyond solitude emerges organically from records proving lies and alliance shift, with courtyard reprise reweighting premise non-literally. Subtext in intuitive trust enriches complexity. Borderline echo in "nurture integrity" phrasing borders on overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in meteorological intuition and lateral patterns. Dialogue natural, subtext-driven ("We need your data"). Repetition slightly uniformizes diction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("layered tranquility" x3, "progressing laterally" x2, "credibly curious" x2) create template cadence and paraphrase churn across beats, dulling propulsion. Minor filter stacks in reflection beats add opacity. Density functional but scaffold-heavy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rogue zone with storm-masked experiments and pigeon network offers fresh synthesis on conspiracy trope via data-driven integrity. Lateral progression transforms suspicion into alliance organically. Minor hedging in tidy unmasking summary.</comment>
