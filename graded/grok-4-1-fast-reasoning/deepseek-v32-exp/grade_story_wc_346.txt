<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's scarred hands and flawed regrets root motivation and intensify via life force sacrifice at closure, earning the final smile. Interiority concrete and embodied in adjustments under awe. Minor abstraction in "beautifully flawed" label slightly dilutes contradiction in peak whisper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush and patterns builds to on-page CR closure in "lullaby complete... lighthouse faded," with cost in her life force and erasure legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in climb. Single scene causality tight, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse gears and pane of hush constrain isolation, charging final beam pulse and fade. Sensory hush thickens purposefully, mirroring internal states through Elara's climb to whisper. Dusk-to-night evolution integrates with climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (final calibration/lullaby) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via gear adjustments and universe's breath-hold to life force cost at toll. Agency in precise work forecloses endurance path. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of flawed grace emerges organically from puppet mending and lullaby rippling across eras, resonating in final echo without statement. Closing image reweights humanity's solace amid unraveling. Ambiguity in her rest invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hush-patterned noticing; voice rhythm modulates from bruised awe to luminescent peace. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at fade. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High figurative density in whisper beat ("rippled outwards... tapestry of solace") borders overwriting without obscuring closure, but patterned. Repetitive "pane of hush"/"nested patterns" loops (4+ echoes) create minor paraphrase churn, dulling propulsion mid-climax. Rhythm varies, density high overall.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Puppet-key-to-lullaby synthesis transforms doomsday trope via nested time-weave, risking lyric hush for inevitable peace image. Fresh flawed-healer angle heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
