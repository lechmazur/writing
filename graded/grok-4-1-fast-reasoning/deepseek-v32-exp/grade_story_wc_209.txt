<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's quiet drive compels consistent micro-choices like visiting the cathedral and painting the mural, rooted in grandmother's legacy; embodied emotions via trembling hands and umbral tenderness feel particular. Internal conflict is subtle but present in reckoning with heart's silence. Final completeness earned via prior discoveries without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (postcards, glass, mural) builds to CR closure in "heart light, knowing she had finally understood," with felt cost of months-long quest. Orientation anchored early in pavilion; shards (cathedral visit, return) taught via seasonal flow. One tightening at glass revelation narrows to nocturnal truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and cathedral glass constrain choices (sanctuary for mural, revelation site); recurrent postcards charge final packing image. Sensory details (frost clinging, light piercing etched layers) selective via artistic POV. Atmosphere of hush mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand night blooms) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via postcard clues to glass deepening that changes knowledge, forcing mural synthesis; agency in patient alignment of gaze. Cost legible in stretched timeframe and emotional reckoning. Coheres to Charged Poise at children's wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden beauty in darkness emerges via particulars (nocturnal flowers, etched layers), reweighted in mural and final stars/unfurling petals without statement. Subtext in grandmother's notes and Elara's tenderness invites ambiguity on revelation's price. Resonant CR ending reconfigures premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with artistic perceptual signature (noticing layers, glows); voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating to hush in revelations. Brief dialogue natural, goal-driven (explaining to children advances closure). No head-hopping; compression in time shards legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid images (light revealing flowers in glass), but repetitive phrasing ("reckoned," "dawning hush" x3+, "umbral tenderness" x2) creates minor loops in reflective beats, dulling propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies; no scaffold in closure. Minor overwrite in autumn motifs touches final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art quest, botanical mystery, and layered glass revelation transforms epiphany trope via recluse artist tie-in. Cathedral window as nocturnal code feels inevitable from postcards. Risks lyric accumulation without gimmick, heightening quiet stakes.</comment>
