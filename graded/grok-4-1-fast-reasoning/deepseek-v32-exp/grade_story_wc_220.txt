<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to bridge distance drives all choices, culminating in earned shift from loss to purpose; intuitive perception concretely enables decoding climax via sound-as-landscape translation. Minor slip in epiphanic summary ("tinted revelation a compass") slightly abstracts embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to decoding tightening, resolving in CR closure where coordinates reprice yearning as purpose with legible cost ("final, painful closeness") in departure beat. Orientation anchored early in scrapyard/cabin; single scene fits defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wasteland and cabin details constrain decoding (cylinder/leaf proximity); leaf as micro-setting charges final image, superimposed veins enabling revelation. Sensory hierarchy (hushed air, gleaming cylinder) reflects bloodhound's perceptual bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distance to closeness) signaled early, tightens via leaf-decoding reversal that narrows options to journey; agency in needle/leaf use forecloses stasis with felt emotional cost. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break reweights stake coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory bridging loss emerges organically from cylinder/leaf intersection, reweighted in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in walk turning relic to compass. Complexity lingers in "painful closeness" ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sound to "stones/valleys"); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to charged spin, distinct texture in syntax evoking wasteland lyricism. No elision or head-hopping; voice biases noticing grooves/veins.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (needle drop, leaf overlay); rhythm varies with tension, but minor paraphrase loops ("wild hush" thrice, "distance" echoes) slightly dull mid-beats without obscuring closure. No scaffold or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc bloodhound decoding phonograph via leaf-lens transforms trope into esoteric revelation; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early vein-map cue.</comment>
