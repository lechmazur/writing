<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Label-speak like repeated "quietly rebellious" and "auroral sorrow" undermines particularity; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during climax drumming, reducing earned change depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to garden symphony; Charged Poise closure legible in "slumped forward, exhausted yet buoyed," with felt cost, one tightening at cosmic hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Auric lagoon pulses responsively, constraining drumming payoff and charging final beacon image; vivid sensory integration mirrors internal rhythm without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shared dream) tightens via hush intensification, driven by agency; exhaustion cost unmistakable post-symphony, reweighting under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of curse-to-unity emerges organically from memory-weaving; resonant non-literal close in eternal drumming echo avoids moralizing until minor final litany slips.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with rhythmic syntax fits drumming motif, stable single POV; perceptual bias via sound/memory strong, but repetitive phrasing erodes distinction under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops in final third ("Elara... had become a catalyst"; repeated "shared dream"/transformation restatements) dull closure; template cadence in litany obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entangled memories, responsive flora, cosmic drumming rebellion; transforms sci-fi tropes via textural unity payoff without gimmickry.</comment>
