<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Characters defined by roles (leader, mechanic, botanist) with clear group motivation intensifying to collective climax, but interiority relies on summary over embodied contradiction; Jax's doubt voices skepticism without simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with message-to-bell progression building density to cadence shift at thrum and nebula unveiling as Resonant Reconfiguration; closure cost legible in ghost's fading and scarred hope reconfiguration; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain bell placement and charge final glowing image, mirroring internal shift; selective sensory details (luminous fruit, chiming warmth) integrate purposefully without catalog; spatial choreography clear across ridges and domes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant survival/hope stake tightens via Jax's doubt forcing reexamination and collective amplification under accumulative lens; one deepening forecloses doubt path with energy cost; agency in rallying and focusing will visible before payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brambled hope theme emerges organically from events to resonant final vine/butterfly image reweighting premise without statement; subtext in trustworthy guidance earned through particulars; ambiguity lingers in ghost's unthankable altruism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person with lyrical perceptual signature modulating from despair to radiance; sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven (Jax grumbles doubt); rhythm purposeful without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in action beats; minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("brambled thing") lacks pressure payoff, but no loops or scaffolds dull closure; strong verbs propel without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi orchard ghost guiding via chalk to nebula premise transforms tropes through specific arches/bell resonance; risk in collective orchestration pays off in earned closure without gimmickry.</comment>
