<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via "feral nostalgia had me in its jaws, shaking me like a rag doll" and contradictory jealousy spiking at the 30-year-old planting tree; motivation to chronicle compels micro-choices like picking the charred stick despite dream-pull; earned stasis in imperfect scroll with aching hand shows foreclosed tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds from grave-dream stain to soaring layers to scroll-filling cadence; orientation anchored early in cabin/ranger/chronicler; closure as Charged Poise RR via "weight had lifted, just a little" with legible ache-cost; nonlinear shards taught via chronological confusion, fitting two-shard default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll as micro-setting constrains chronicling choice and charges final "testament" image; sensory selectivity (silence as "physical weight," wind "cold slap") reflects jaded POV narrowing; cabin walls "lean in, listening" mirrors isolation without overt symbolism; purposeful details evolve with dream-shard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via jealousy spike during soar ("hot spike pierced me") narrowing options to non-linear scroll; agency in forcing fragments despite pull, with hand-ache cost legible; pressure coheres to reweight grave from horror to "just another part of the story."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of narrative-taming chaos emerges organically from grave/scroll/soar particulars, no statements; final "quiet soar, inside my chest" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting jaded wonder without moral; ambiguity lingers in imperfect/ragged narrative; irony in chronicler-victim tension enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature (dreams as "screaming jumble," time as "sediment"); voice texture via rhythmic modulation ("jaded wonder... awe carved hollow"); no head-hopping, diction POV-bound (ranger/cabin grit amid lyric soar); compression legible under taught nonlinear pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "charred stick from the fireplace, ready to mark"); rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors consistent (peaks "broken teeth"); minor paraphrase loops in jealousy beats (-0.3); no scaffold or closure-touching artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid chronicling with "jealous of past selves" fueling non-linear scroll; soaring as necessary perspective transforms nostalgia trope; risk in chronological confusion pays off at imperfect closure; no derivative templates, voice commits to introspective vision.</comment>
