<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in proving garden bond over luck, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; declarative traits dominate without on-page internal conflict testing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as CR in final marbles gleaming amid garden dialogue, cost felt in years of devotion; orientation anchored early, but thin tightening via visitors mildly weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden maze and marbles as micro-settings constrain paths/vines and charge final image powerfully; sensory details (gnarled hands polishing cracks) filtered through pragmatic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove non-chance flourishing) signaled early with one deepening via visitors' flickering devices under accumulative lens; pressure coherent but remains low, lacking live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of effort defying quantified luck emerges from marble-vine particulars and garden responses, resonant CR reweights premise; minor slips in repetitive assertions to visitors border echo without overt moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature on gleaming cracks and parting hedges; purposeful repetition teaches pattern suiting textural lens, rhythm modulates mildly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "mended deception," "small victories elaborately") and synonym churn across reflections create template cadence, dulling propulsion through bulk of text including near-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh premise synthesizing measurable luck era with gardener-garden bond via cracked marbles as irreplaceable symbols; transforms devotion trope organically without hedging.</comment>
