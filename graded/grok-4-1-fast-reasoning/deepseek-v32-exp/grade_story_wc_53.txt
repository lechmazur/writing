<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's resolve drives wading into the lagoon despite embodied regret, with contradictory impulses in clutching the jammed camera; final acceptance earned via prior causality. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "ambitions, once sharp as broken glass, were now eroded."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fragment density builds to conceptual repricing at camera glow ("images flickered... time was not a line but a river") with surrender cost legible; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single continuous scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon constrains journey ("boots sinking... waded into the lagoon, the water cool and thick"), mirroring internal fracture; sensory selection (hum, mist, bubbles) selective and purposeful, charges final calming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate ghost for peace) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via whisper fragments and island confrontation narrowing to surrender; agency in holding up camera forecloses reclaiming moments with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented time/life emerges organically from particulars (story shards, camera images), resonant CR in final realization reweights without moralizing; final image ("lagoon's waters calmed") answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (chronological confusion filters setting); rhythmic prose modulates (lyrical build to crisp closure), no head-hopping; minimal dialogue natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor loops ("fractured stillness" x2, "eroded ambitions" x3) and synonym churn slightly dull texture; no artifacts touch closure glow beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of carousel/lagoon/ghost negotiation transforms regret tropes via camera alchemy; fresh angle on time as river feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
