<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frugal traits consistently motivate schematics use and ironic faith, with embodied tremble/chuckle showing contradiction; earned realization at "gave everything yet gained everything" forecloses empirical limits with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as tile placement builds density to glow/voice/uncloaking; closure DC via tile fusion and CR in devotion revelation lands on-page with ironic cost legible in final walk-away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reimagined palace mosaics/paths constrain tile alignment and charge mosaic fusion image; dusky harmony sensory gradient mirrors ritual, filtering via astronomer's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant covenant stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tile pulse/voice to sealing under agency; cost unmistakable in "empirically ironic faith" and foreclosed path at palace hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of devotion-in-seeking emerges from math/art particulars to CR resonance; final image reweights frugality without literal moral, though "true devotion... in the seeking itself" borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in celestial/precise noticing; poetic diction consistent but repetitive motifs converge rhythm; brief dialogue natural/subtextual in reply to voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("dusky harmony" x5, "empirically ironic" x2, schematic phrasing x3) and ending paraphrase churn dull closure image; figurative density overwrites ritual peak without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh magic-square ritual transforms Babylonian tropes via frugal math-devotion synthesis; covenant seal feels inevitable from schematics constraint, risking ironic empiricism payoff.</comment>
