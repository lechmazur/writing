<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to find beauty in unfinished drives consistent traits and intensifies via echo unbinding; interiority concrete in acoustic perceptions. Micro-choices like violin play reveal values under silence's pressure. Final endurance earned by loss, with embodied grief; minor epiphanic phrasing at "magnificent simplicity" slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from daily play to bonfire unbinding, tightening stake via echoed past. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Echo Harbor, sunken orchard). Closure as CR in "true beauty lies in the unfinished," reweighting hush with loss cost legible in family voices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details acoustic-selective (echoes off shipwrecks) constrain violin choices and charge closure image of resonating hulls. Sunken orchard mirrors internal persistence, integrated via play striking wrecks. Recurring bowl/object grounds micro-setting, evolving with heat; POV bias acoustic filters vividly without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive tradition amid hush) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via unbinding reversals narrowing to present meaning. Agency in bonfire build forces endurance; cost felt in family absence amid voices. One tightening sufficient under lens, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges via particulars (half-drowned trees, unbound echoes) shifting hush from oppression. Subtext in silence-dance; epiphany earned but overt restatements ("not an enemy, but a companion") border thematic echo, diluting resonance without moralizing penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with acoustic perceptual signature; voice lyrical, modulating rhythm to intensity (short sentences at unbinding). No dialogue; diction character-bound, compression purposeful in lyric mode taught early. No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "unfinished," "chronic hush as companion," "beauty" across final third dull closure image (−1.2); template cadence in repetitive realization sentences ("She realized..."). Density low with redundancies (bowl pulsing, shipwrecks listening x2); rhythm varies but artifacts obscure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic echoes in bowl unbound by violin/bonfire transforms silence trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via memory's cost; no derivative echoes, premise commits to post-fire world logic.</comment>
