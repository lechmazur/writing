<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in reclaiming battlefield, shown through deliberate planting honoring fallen; interiority concrete in thoughts like "Fertilize the earth, he thought, and let peace grow from the scars." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, reducing depth in a single-POV piece; no strong internal conflict or embodied emotional friction under minimal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to scattering seeds, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "the jetty bloomed on, a narrow vastness of light in the dark" reconfigures barren past to renewal. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via birds guiding soil spots narrows tactics. Cost legible in emptied satchel and labor, felt in final satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight vividly selective—glowing flowers, narrow stone vs. immense ocean—constrains solitary work and charges final image as "testament to narrow vastness." Sensory hierarchy POV-biased via whispers, bird calls, rattles; evolves causally to sanctuary mirroring renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclaiming battlefield) signaled early, coheres accumulatively with density increase to completion; birds' guidance deepens one key tactic. Minimal opposition flattens pressure—no reversal tests commitment, resolution smooth without narrowing live options or trade-off cost beyond labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from scars emerges organically via seed-planting on bloody land, birds/dead languages bridging past/present; final image of "submerged concord hummed" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in honoring fallen amid harmony avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to gifts (dead tongues, bird calls); rhythmic texture modulates poetically. No head-hopping or elision issues; capped by Q7 artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn—"by understanding bird calls" exact 4x, "collection of dried seed pods" 3x, "after the reef dies" 3x—dull propulsion and obscure closure image density. Template cadence in repetitive "He [action]" stems across paragraphs; read-aloud rhythm drags despite vivid images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman using dead languages/bird calls to garden post-reef battlefield transforms renewal tropes via "narrow vastness" frame; bold lyric risk heightens poetic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
