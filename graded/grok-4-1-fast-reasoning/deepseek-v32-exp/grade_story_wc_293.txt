<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's dynamically observant trait drives concrete actions like angling the glass flake against flutters, earning his shift from haunted doubt to fiddle-playing bridge; embodied awe (breathless, trembling fingers) layers contradiction without labels dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density builds to CR closure—he plays the fiddle, remaking "never" into a gateway with conceptual cost legible in the final pocketed flake and softened reality; orientation anchored immediately at pullout post-vanishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap flutters and glass flake constrain key alignment choice and charge final humming resonance/pocketing; sensory selectivity (tremors in aspens, wind snaps) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel vanishing deepens accumulatively via flutter interpretation to visceral amnesty insight, narrowing doubt with agency in fiddle play; cost felt in foreclosed despair, charging poise at road departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented absolution emerges organically from flake shadows and amnesty realization, resonant in non-literal fiddle bridge answering "never"; avoids moralizing, lingering ambiguity in liminal space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (shifting shadows, minute tremors) stable in single close-third POV; rhythmic modulation heightens ethereal peak without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("sculpt possibility," "luminous disbelief," repeated recounting) and synonym churn for awe dull density in realization beat; dense metaphors cohere but risk overwriting without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fiddler, antique flake, and flutter-code transforms mystical hitchhiker trope into inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
