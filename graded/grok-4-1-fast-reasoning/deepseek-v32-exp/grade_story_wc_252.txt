<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (combative tenderness warring within) act simultaneously in the call's pull versus her guarded heart; final surrender earned by scrimshaw's unlocking and prior coiled tension. Interiority concrete and embodied (vibration in marrow, scrimshaw warming). No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whale call builds to island's shimmer and on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (stepping ashore, scrimshaw dissolving into foam as world fades). Orientation anchored early (docks, tide receding). Cost legible in "layers... begin to unlock" yielding to peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe as micro-setting constrains choice (liminal negotiation enables wading to island); scrimshaw (body/tool) charges final image. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (bone vibration, cool shallow water, glowing scrimshaw). Details mirror internal yielding without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (answer call or remain tethered) signaled early, tightens via call's intensification narrowing to island appearance; agency in silent steps into surf forecloses shore life. Cost felt in detachment's "irrevocable step." Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of yielding guarded heart to true nature emerges organically from scrimshaw key and whale song; final image (smile, home in deep) offers non-literal reconfiguration of pacified world's safety vs. freedom. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in combative tenderness settling to peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (grace amid grime, rhythm hidden); rhythmic prose modulates from coiled tension to yielding (e.g., "fluid contrast to the rough, splintered wood"). Lyrical compression purposeful and taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (sentences layer senses/actions without redundancy); rhythm varies (short punchy steps into surf vs. flowing descriptions). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language (heart unlocking like key) coherent and pattern-taught. Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-Pacification world + mythic disappearing island unlocked by whale call transforms tropes via lived grace and scrimshaw logic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final foam dissolution inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
