<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via breathing and past-life ache that compels releases; interiority concrete in "pilgrim of sparks." Minor slip in label-speak ("spiritually curious nature") without embodied tradeoff, but change earned at "ache... softened, replaced by completion."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from memory cue to strand releases, culminating in Conceptual Repricing ("memory... settled like a gentle weight, no longer a burden, but a foundation") with legible conceptual cost of history's endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viaduct's ivy crevice constrains discovery/reach; wisteria/damp stone sensory filter sharpens foggy lucidity, charging final image where "wisteria seemed to glow with renewed vitality."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate/release unused love) signaled early, escalates via breathing-deepening that unveils strands and self-healing; agency in channeling tear forecloses past ache with visible cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of stored love's release emerges organically from strand ignitions; resonant non-literal close ("love's enduring, hidden geography") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hazy/clear details; rhythmic lyricism modulates with breath intensity, distinct texture in "foggy lucidity."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel revelations, but minor paraphrase loops on "healing" and "sparks" (e.g., repeated "shower of gentle sparks" variants) dull peak releases without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura, Kwan Yin's tear, and viaduct love-strands transforms spiritual quest into tangible releases; risk in breathing-method revelations heightens stakes organically.</comment>
