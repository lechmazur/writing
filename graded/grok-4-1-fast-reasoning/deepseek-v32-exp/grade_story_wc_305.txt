<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear in post-forgiveness ache driving rituals; kindly decisive trait shown in precise scalloping. Interiority concrete via hairpin warmth, but epiphanies like "contentment sprang from active participation" border diagnostic without full embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with ritual density building to hairpin glow as CR closure; orientation anchored early in grotto/cliffs. Cost legible in "hollow ache" reconfigured by renewal realization; one tightening via alcove discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto, cliffs, and moss constrain climbing/scalloping choices; trees charge perspective for epiphany. Vineyard hush and clouds mirror shadows/light coexistence in final image, sensory selective via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment quest) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glow revelation narrowing to rebirth embrace. Agency in rituals forecloses resistance path, but lacks sharp internal trade-off cost on pivotal glow beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rebirth theme emerges from scalloping/hairpin shifts, resonant in final "scallop a new path" without overt moral. Complexity in pain-to-peace arc, but "source of contentment lay in the courage" nears explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close third with lyrical perceptual signature tied to nature; rhythm modulates reflective intensity. No dialogue; voice consistent but some register elevation in epiphanies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "scallop," "climbing trees," and contentment epiphanies (e.g., repeated "cycle of rebirth" phrasing) create synonym churn dulling final third. Template cadence in reflective sentences; density overwrites closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Scalloping stone and cloud-lofted grotto transform rebirth trope via tactile ritual; hairpin glow inflects heirloom motif freshly. Familiar epiphany arc limits boldness.</comment>
