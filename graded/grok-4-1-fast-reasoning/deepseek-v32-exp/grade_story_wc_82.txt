<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via embodied grief during gem polishing; contradictory impulses (ignore shadow, channel pain into craft) act simultaneously. Final shadow merger earned by persistent micro-choices in folding cranes. Shadow as sentient entity applies external pressure without diluting single-POV interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through repetitive polishing/folding beats culminating in RR (shadow merger with felt emotional cost). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara polishing gem in floating island tea garden). Closure cost legible in "wave of release" after final crane, reconfiguring grief-to-hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass basilica's crystalline spires and dream orbs constrain choices (climbing steps burdens emotionally) and charge final image (basilica pulses/glows). Sensory details (rainbows on hands, rustling leaves) filtered through grief bias. Micro-setting (gem, cranes) evolves tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reattach shadow via cranes) signaled early; accumulative deepening via dream-evoked grief (mother's voice) narrows emotional options with visible torment cost. Agency in persistent polishing/folding forecloses vulnerability path. Escalation coheres without reversal overload, charging crane-stirring climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief-transmutation emerges organically via gem/cranes images shifting from chaos to flight. Final image (cranes rustling, shadow merging) offers non-literal resonant answer to loss-endurance question. Subtext in shadow's mimicry implies lingering ambiguity without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (luminous torment sears soul). Voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences in polishing beats). No dialogue; purposeful compression in repetitive craft builds texture without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (polishing/folding) advancing accumulative pressure; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("descends while ascending" thrice) dull mid-beats but spare closure. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors in peak (final crane fold).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-polishing, grief-cranes, detached shadow reattachment feels inevitable from crafty particulars. Bold fantasy elements (floating isle, elastic time) heighten emotional stakes organically. No derivative tropes; shadow's mimicry adds ingenious resonance.</comment>
