<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to discover borrowed time's texture is consistent and compels ritual choices, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; revelation feels diagnostic rather than earned through embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "texture of borrowed time... smooth, cool silk overlaying rough, urgent stone," reconfiguring inheritance with felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound atrium and starlight vividly constrain vigil and evolve causally ("starlight intensifying"); final "starlight watched over the empty shell" charges closure image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stabilizing vortex tightens post-hatch ("must act quickly"); Elara's agency in cap placement and seed-sowing forecloses collapse with on-page risk of energy chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Order-from-chaos theme emerges organically via seeds and entropy method; final portal step offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, lingering in intertwined past/future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature attuned to serenity motifs; rhythm modulates pressure but uniform cadence in descriptive runs dulls peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("wild serenity," "furious tranquility" cycled 4+ times) and synonym churn in climax summaries ("Elara knew... had prepared... had succeeded") obscure propulsion and dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heirloom seeds decreasing entropy to tame vortex feels organic and inevitable; transforms tropes through specific oak cap ritual without gimmickry.</comment>
