<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's desperately jocular trait reveals interior contradiction in her brittle smile and jokes to pigeons, compelling Leo's shift; motivation roots in witnessed isolation and intensifies via reciprocity demand. Leo's skepticism yields to earned vulnerability without stock epiphanies. Minor diagnostic "malady she had diagnosed" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rumor density building to CR closure: final image of station as "living heart" reconfigures isolation with imperfect cost ("endless, but... real"). Orientation anchors early in ivy-overgrown station; Leo's visit as one tightening shard suffices. Weeks-later jump legible under lens, pays off charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station's ivy and mossy bench tactilely constrain gathering, mirroring decay-to-connection; recurring greenery "listens" and charges final "living heart" image. Sensory hierarchy (echoing voice, damp air) reflects Elara's priorities. No white-room; evolves causally with group arrival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reciprocity cures loneliness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Leo's listening agreement narrowing his skepticism to rock-passing agency. Cost legible in "fragile bonds" and endless chain; one decisive deepening suffices. No abstract stakes; felt in Leo's unnamed "catalysis of emotion."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of connection-through-sharing emerges from moon rock's hand-to-hand journey and rumor chains, resonant in final whisper-wave without moralizing. Reciprocity reweights loneliness premise obliquely via Elara's softening warmth. No tidy binary; embraces imperfection as cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (jocular lens on decay); dialogue natural/subtextual ("rock and a proposition") advances reciprocity goal. Voice texture distinct in syntax like "desperately jocular air," modulates without drift. Minor elevated diction fits lyric tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm propels with varied openings; density high, e.g., "silence and vines conspired" weaves atmosphere/action. Minor overwriting in metaphor strings ("fabric of polite anarchy") during peak without muddle. No loops; final line recharges ivy motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moon rock as reciprocity token transforms loneliness trope into fresh chain-reaction premise; rumor logistics ingeniously ground elusiveness. Risky poetic frame ("polite anarchy") heightens without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight via Elara's quest synthesizing aid-worker isolation uniquely.</comment>
