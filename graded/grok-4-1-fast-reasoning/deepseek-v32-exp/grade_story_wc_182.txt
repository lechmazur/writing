<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's resourcefulness consistently drives decoding and calm pivots, earning the purpose shift; Kael's impatience adds pressure but remains told via "grew impatient, his fear palpable" without embodied contradiction. Internal conflict thin, with tidy progression lacking contradictory impulses in peak beats like the meditative pause.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: traveler arrives therefore diary decode therefore purpose renegotiation therefore doorway reveals library; closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with Kael reading and timeline healing, cost in confronting error legible at "Kael's own avoidance... had caused the paradox." Orientation anchored early in Glimmering Stack; single scene progression fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain bookstore labyrinth constrains navigation and shifting paths, charging choices like horticulture retrieval and floating chamber entry; sensory details (dusty alcove, humming books) selective via Elara's linguistic bias. Final hall glow mirrors redemption, evolving with events without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize timeline via library) signaled early, tightens causally via purpose shift narrowing frantic search to meditative focus, forcing trade-off with cost in Kael's confrontation; agency in Elara's binding words forecloses haste path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through unlearned lessons emerges via gap research and error confrontation, resonant in final "lessons silently echoing"; "unheard symphony" motif returns to recharge without shouting, though ending's "testament to knowledge and redemption" borders overt summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV via Elara's perceptual signature (linguistic decoding of symbols); voice lyrical with rhythmic modulation ("unheard symphony" cadence), minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven in Kael's babbling; no head-hopping, distance tightens appropriately in chamber tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops like repeated "carefully resourceful" and "gaps" across beats dull density (−0.4); figurative density high in opener ("labyrinthine... misty peaks") risks overwrite without pattern payoff, though closure image clean.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time paradox, mistake library, and coded flora guide transforms tropes organically; "library shifts on seeker's intentions" twist earned via diary, heightening stakes through redemption calculus without late rules.</comment>
