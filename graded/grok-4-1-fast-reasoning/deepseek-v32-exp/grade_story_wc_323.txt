<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reconnect celestial navigation intensifies through teaching micro-choices like using the chain link and expanding for Kael, earning her purpose surge; interiority concrete via embodied relic grasp. Students secondary but Kael applies pressure via disengagement turning fascination. Minor flaw: students slightly generic, no voice distinction since minimal speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lesson builds density from apathy to engagement to solo CR closure ("ocean felt less like a prison and more like a launchpad"), reweighting horizons with emotional cost legible in final clutch. Orientation anchored early (Elara in Thalassia chamber). Single scene + coda shard fits defaults; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Benthic city and Astral holograms vivid/selective (coral domes, star glow on faces), filtering through Elara's priorities; chain link as micro-setting constrains emotionally, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy matches calm lesson urgency; spatial coherence clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle cosmic curiosity post-aliens) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Kael's shift after expansion, narrowing apathy option with Elara's felt purpose cost. Pressure coheres texturally to CR; agency in adaptive teaching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of celestial reconnection from depths emerges via particulars (edge geometry + xenocartography, chain link reprise), final CR image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in alien-forced reevaluation; earned via struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (star-yearning bias); prose rhythm modulates from measured lesson to quiet intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("understanding your place"); no head-hopping, diction POV-apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm/syntax propel accumulatively; "somber marvel" purposeful recurrence without loop. Minor scaffold in repetitive "unfolded horizons" phrasing (−0.3), but no closure touch; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abyssal-starsailors post-aliens, transforming navigation trope via relic/xenocartography; bold benthic frame heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Chain link reprise feels inevitable.</comment>
