<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's powerfully gentle trait and motivation to discover connection's texture drive micro-choices like patient listening amid frustration, culminating in earned reconfiguration when harmony emerges. Contradictory impulses (force vs. patience) act in scene, with final assembly foreclosing isolation at felt cost. No safety-hedging; flaws like assumption-blindness compound before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through repeated chimes, breaks with lens modification ("channeling the prism-song outward"), cadence shifts to symphony in atrium for CR closure. Orientation anchored early (Elara in lab by para 1). Cost legible in "phantom...just beyond her grasp" resolved by interwoven tapestry image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lab's resonance chambers, silvery disks, and golden shadows constrain choices (isolation questioned, atrium projection enabled); miner's lens as micro-setting charges final symphony. Sensory hierarchy auditory-dominant, POV-filtered (Elara notices harmonic interactions). Evolves causally from sterile confines to "living organ."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, tightens via textural escalation: frustration deepens repetitions, then projection yields harmony, narrowing isolation option with patience cost. Agency in modifications forces stance crystallization. Pressure coheres accumulatively to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of connection as woven tapestry emerges organically from sonic experiments, reweighted non-literally by final "complex, warm roughness...settle into her bones." No moralizing; ambiguity in "every lost sound...waiting to be heard anew" lingers with conceptual cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from questioning to weaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: sonic bias ("harmonic spectra," "auditory light"). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from introspective to shimmering crescendo, consistent under pressure. Purposeful compression in repetitions taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "prism-song unfolding like a visible ribbon" advances sound and revelation), but minor overwrite in metaphor strings ("dance of auditory light," "ribbon of color and tone") during peak without full pattern payoff dulls propulsion. No loops, clean grammar; rhythm varies but some template stems ("She...").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic pilgrimage in post-grid world transforms tropes (archive to living organ) via lens as acoustic bridge; risk-taking in textural metaphors heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration ("mending tears in the auditory fabric") inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
