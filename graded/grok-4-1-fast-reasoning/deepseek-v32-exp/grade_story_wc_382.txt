<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Professor's binding to the building and patient guidance compel his endurance with felt cost in dissolution; narrator's interrogation reveals hierarchy of values. Minor slip: embodied emotions lean lyrical over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as lesson density builds to CR closure via seal transfer and ghost's dissolution ("form beginning to dissolve into the starlight"), with conceptual cost of silent continuation legible on-page. Orientation anchors early; one tightening via direct question suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and seal constrain choices (lessons traced via seal on walls) and charge final image. Sensory details selective (jasmine, steam, meteors) mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning via lies tightens accumulatively through deepening revelations, narrowing to direct interrogation that forecloses prior pretense with ghost's loss. Agency in questioning drives CR; cost felt in isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lies enabling dead-living languages emerges organically via seal and final image, offering resonant CR repricing without moralizing; prior particulars reweighted in "conversation that would now continue silently."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in architectural metaphors ("iron bones and mortar veins") biases noticing; first-person POV stable with rhythmic modulation. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("same reason you are").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs; high density integrates image/action without loops. Minor figurative density in lessons but pattern-taught and legible, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghost-as-building-linguist via seal transforms spectral trope into fresh premise; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight with conceptual integrity.</comment>
