<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (benevolent intent vs. ruthless methods) act in her walking choices, earning the "forgive" release of guilt at the chessboard with visible emotional cost. Interiority concrete via embodied scars and memories anchored to present steps. Minor label repetition ("benevolently ruthless") slightly dilutes without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via walking words ("remember" to "peace"), culminating in CR closure where chessboard shifts from loss to potential with guilt-release cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in gallery. Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whispering gallery acoustics constrain walking method and charge echoes; chessboard handled tactilely, reweighting to "clean slate" in closure image. Sensory details (marble steps, whispers) POV-filtered through gesture focus. Body/setting interplay evolved causally with penumbra light shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind gestures/trauma) signaled early, Accumulative escalation via deepening word patterns and memory density forces "forgive" renunciation, foreclosing guilt path with legible cost in lighter heart. Protagonist agency in patterns; one tightening sufficient. No live option fully closed mid-beat, but charges end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures illuminating luminous absence emerges organically from walking echoes and chessboard reprise, offering non-literal answer in "peace" pattern reweighting prior loss. No moralizing; ambiguity in absence's promise lingers with cost. Internal arc inextricable from interregnum void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (gesture/penumbra focus) and rhythmic modulation via step patterns under "stress" of task. Voice texture distinct in syntax echoing whispers. No dialogue or head-hopping; elisions purposeful for density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in step-mantras, but repetitive descriptors ("nomadic penumbra," "benevolently ruthless") create minor paraphrase loops across middle beats, dulling some momentum without obscuring closure image. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no major artifacts or scaffold in peak "forgive" turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of walking-as-writing in acoustic gallery transforms interregnum void trope, with penumbra/chessboard inflections growing inevitably to CR closure. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivatives.</comment>
