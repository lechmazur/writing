<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove her theory drives consistent micro-choices like kneeling and using the prism, with internal conflict peaking in the embodied blow of her guilt vision. Contradictory impulses—mission purity vs. revealed regret—act simultaneously in the frost scenes, earning her final humility. Minor deduction for occasional label-speak like "firmly grounded" that slightly abstracts rather than embodies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions densify from joy/sorrow to personal guilt, culminating in CR closure where "assumptions shatter" reweights her premise with legible emotional cost in the heavier prism. Single continuous scene fits defaults; orientation anchored early in arbor/car. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and frost window integrate purposefully, with frost patterns constraining the communion method and charging the revelation beat. Sensory hush and cold breath reflect mystic bias; recurring prism/prism evolution mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (window/prism) constrains pivotal visions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove theory) signaled early tightens accumulatively via darkening visions that force personal reckoning, foreclosing purity assumption with felt cost in tilted world/humility. Agency in communing sustains pressure to Charged Poise ending; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of absorbed emotions emerges organically from visions to self-revelation, reweighted in final "truthful lies" image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like couple's kiss to her doubt avoids platitudes; protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature attuned to "whispers" and emotional residues; diction/rhythm modulate poetically yet legibly from methodical setup to revelatory peak. No head-hopping or withholding; voice particular to mystic without register drift.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, with varied rhythm supporting accumulative build; minor paraphrase loops around "shifted hush" and "firmly grounded" dull ~2% without touching closure. No heavy artifacts or filter stacks; clean syntax/grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic empiricism via frost visions transforms emotion-memory trope into personal CR; risk in surreal mechanics feels inevitable from established theory. No derivative echoes; bold premise commitment heightens ingenuity.</comment>
