<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grief quest drives consistent micro-choices like unrolling ribbons and matching to butterflies; interiority concrete in poem whispers and memory links. Weakness in label-speak like "fiercely meditative" without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; change to peace feels earned but lacks pivotal embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from ribbon discovery to grief realization as network; orientation anchored early in greenhouse entry. Closure CR lands cleanly at "She realized the collective grief was not a void but a network," reweighting premise with quest-cost peace. One tightening via ribbon-butterfly matching suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse's fractured glass, ivy, ferns constrain meditative paths and mirror crumbling resilience; butterflies' routes parallel journeys, charging final swirl. Sensory selection purposeful, filtered through Elara's priorities; bench anchors spatial choreography coherently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to discover grief's shape signaled early, deepens accumulatively over migration days via emotional retracing; agency in following spectral cues narrows introspective options. Cost legible in grandfather's fade and infused carving duty; pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief as connective weave emerges organically from ribbons, butterflies, poems; avoids statement via image shifts like migration peak to final dance. Resonant CR reweights without moralizing; earned through particulars, lingering ambiguity in transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with meditative perceptual signature in noticing monarch routes and breezes as verses; diction poetic yet consistent. No dialogue, but whispers natural; rhythm modulates with intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "thundering calm" (4x) and paraphrase loops in closing ("grief... woven," "transformation, woven") create synonym churn, dulling closure image; template cadence in ending summaries ("She... ready to," "The... remained"). Figurative density overwrites peak realization without payoff; rhythm varies but artifacts drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral poet guide, ribbon-butterfly grief map transforms tropes organically. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens introspection; final CR inevitable from particulars.</comment>
