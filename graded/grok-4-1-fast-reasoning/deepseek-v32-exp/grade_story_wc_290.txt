<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between claustrophobia and adventure drives micro-choices like pressing on despite narrowing passages; embodied fear eases credibly at climax via organ's calm. Final transformation earned through prior mapping efforts. Minor label-speak in reflections ("prudently adventurous") avoids heavier deduction as it anchors early motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spatial chaos patterns build density, organ breaks them for RR closure (nexus stabilizes, starlight glows) with felt cost of sustained fear. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara, nexus, fallow period). Single scene fits defaults; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus vividly constrains via warping walls mirroring claustrophobia, charging final stable image; starlight pierces as recurring anchor. Sensory organ reverberation integrates purposefully. Selective details (unstable geometry) filter through explorer's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover key) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as mutiny intensifies against compass use; organ deepening forces awe-driven chart, narrowing fear options. Agency in transcribing notes yields visible cost (claustrophobia threat). Climax trade-off legible in music's fleeting calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony taming chaos emerges organically from organ calming mutiny, resonant in final "space is what you make of it" image reweighting fear. Wistful rebellion motif shifts from internal to mastery without moralizing. Repetitive end summaries slightly dilute emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (spatial dread via bodily immobilization); voice texture poetic yet legible, modulating rhythm in chaos (short sentences) to awe (crescendo). Brief keeper dialogue natural, goal-driven exposition advances plot. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops in final third ("wistful rebellion," "fallow period," "spatial mutiny" recur 3-4x without new pressure, dulling closure image); synonym churn in transformation beats ("transformed," "conquer," "victory"). Template cadence in reflective endings drags propulsion. Density suffers from redundancies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny tamed by organ/compass synthesizes fresh premise organically; tropes (lost key quest) transformed via harmonic geometry. Bold risk in mutiny's "dance of possibilities" feels inevitable in hindsight. No close template echoes.</comment>
