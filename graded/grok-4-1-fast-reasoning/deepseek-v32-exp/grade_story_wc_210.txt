<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to reimagine civilization drives consistent micro-choices like gathering materials and teaching settlers; interiority concrete via alchemical visions but edges into diagnostic abstraction on "false comfort of nostalgia."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds reflective density to CR closure in "lanterns glowed with captured sunlight" image, reweighting magic-dependency with effort-cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening via bottle-as-lesson realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors like "boots crunching on brittle leaves" and sagging lanterns guide choices, evolving to reed-solar redesigns that charge final thriving image; recurring bottle constrains patience-driven revival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of non-magical revival signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening conceptions narrowing to action like salvaging wood; agency in endurance forecloses wish-path with visible slow-revival cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of ingenuity over entitlement emerges from particulars like wish-failures to lantern-redesigns, resonating in "laughter a testament" without moralizing; earned via conflicted rejection, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with alchemist-biased perception (chemistry transformations); rhythmic texture supports reflection but minor syntactic repetition under conceptual stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("rejected the false comfort" x3, "working memory" x3, "conceived" variants) create paraphrase churn across reflective beats, dulling propulsion; density varies but template cadence in mid-section drags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wish-trope ruin into reason-rebuild via alchemical memory-work; bottle's sealed evolution to town-square symbol feels inevitable, transforming ghost-town archetype organically.</comment>
