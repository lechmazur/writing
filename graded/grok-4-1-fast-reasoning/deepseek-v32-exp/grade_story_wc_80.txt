<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied effectively in "his exterior granite hiding a core of deep-feeling silt," constraining sorrow during note placement without diagnostic labels; final confession earns internal change with cost of personal dream foreclosure. Minor slip in alternating summary of traits over simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from inkwell uncorking through note progression to personal confession; Charged Poise closure in "He folded it tight and pressed it deep...now permanently underwater" reconfigures absences with undeniable opportunity cost. Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains choices via "slimy tiles" and "crack in a pillar," charging final step repair; recurring inkwell as micro-setting tethers amid decay. Sensory hierarchy surveyor-specific, mirroring internal voids without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to wrest dreams tightens texturally from architect/lovers to own confession, narrowing options with endurance cost legible in final seal. Pressure coheres without reversal overload; agency in immersion forecloses solid-shore path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interlaced absence emerges organically from note shards to self-mending, final image resonating without statement; reweights premise via soul-foundation parallel. Complexity in ambition's voids avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in surveyor precision ("precise angle of its decay") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from deliberate to ember-quiet. Stable limited POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "Dipping his pen, he began to write on a slip of oilskin paper"; minor overwrite in repeated "wrest" and "hushed blaze" metaphors slightly muddles peak density without closure harm. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of surveyor as dream-archeologist via mortar-notes transforms abandonment trope; risk in total immersion heightens stakes organically. Final inkwell anchor inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
