<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to archive emotions drives ritual and new purpose post-prophecy; embodied disquiet ("hands tremble") reveals contradiction. Final vow earns change via prior immersion causality. Minor lack of deeper flaws prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure: prophecy reconfigures archiving as destiny prediction ("velvet disquiet followed him like a shadow"). Cost legible in fragile balance and responsibility. Single scene holds without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard atop skyscraper constrains ritual spot and enables "confluence...garden's ancient energy" birthing prophecy. Sensory details (rustle, hum) filter through Elian's focus. Charges final descent image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake to archive tightens via prophecy revelation, narrowing to warn/understand destiny. Agency in continued recording despite fear; cost in trembling hands and shadow disquiet. Accumulative deepening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of emotions capturing fate emerges via prophecy from patterns; final vow reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance in memory reprise cautioning inspiration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with Elian-specific perception (dead languages blending with garden). Prose texture modulates immersion rhythm. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels ritual to revelation; high density integrates setting/action. Purposeful "velvet disquiet" repetition charges end without loops. Clean syntax under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phonograph prophecy in skyscraper orchard synthesizes surreal archive fate organically. Risky surrealism heightens stakes via garden energy, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
