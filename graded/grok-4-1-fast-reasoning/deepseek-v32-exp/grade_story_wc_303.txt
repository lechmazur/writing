<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in "mulberry ache, deep and bruise-purple" and contradictory impulses via plants' urging against Empire duty; final choice to play violin earned by telepathic surge and coffee revelation. Minor abstraction in "perforated destiny" feels label-like without full micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from coffee stains to violin notes causing propagation; on-page RR/CR closure in violin melting and seeds bursting, cost legible in lingering ache and lost artifact. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via second note suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Velvet Observatory and midsummer heat constrain via cold-weeping violin against thick air, charging final lighter space; plants as micro-setting mirror turmoil through telepathic thirst. Selective sensory weave (frost sound, humid merge) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream vs. Empire) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via coffee map narrowing to violin play; agency in lifting bow forecloses authentication path with violin-melt cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony over control emerges organically from propagation via music, not force; final image of seeds and whole destiny reweights freedom/control without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in coffee stains drying as "permanent patterns."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in plant whispers and colored aches; voice texture poetic yet biased (green murmurs, frost cracks). Rhythmic modulation heightens play climax without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric repetition ("mulberry ache," propagation); rhythm varies for propulsion, but figurative density borders muddle in violin beat ("cracking frost... shattering ice"). No loops; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants, ice violin propagation, coffee divination transforms artifact-authentication trope into revolution; risk in dense poeticism heightens stakes without gimmick. Hindsight inevitability in harmony choice.</comment>
