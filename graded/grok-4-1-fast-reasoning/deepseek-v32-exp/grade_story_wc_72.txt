<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to welcome nuance intensifies credibly through revelations, rooted in kind traits; interiority particular via telepathic tendrils piercing solitude. Weakness: contradictory impulses summarized ("certainty fractured") rather than acting simultaneously, with label-speak like "incisively kind" reducing embodiment in key discovery beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelation density builds from fissure glimpse to essence threading, tightening knowledge toward CR closure ("through structural weakness, it had found strength in flexibility"). Cost legible in shift from isolation to community; orientation anchored instantly in first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Underwater garden vividly selective (iridescent coral, crumbling arches, kelp swaying), constraining choices via detected fissures and fragile seam that enable revelations. Recurring coral/essence charges final humming image; sensory hierarchy fits telepathic POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embrace nuance over certainty) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via cascading revelations and essence threading that narrows from solitary duty to shared guardianship. Agency in telepathic guidance forces trade-off (stasis foreclosed); cost felt in "patient eyes" awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Duality theme (poison/remedy, certainty/nuance) emerges organically from foxglove recall and revelation waves, reweighted in final tapestry image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like voluntary stone transformation; invites ambiguity on guardianship's future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single telepathic POV, with perceptual signature (mind-piercing tendrils, ocean whispers) and rhythmic modulation ("waves against the shore"). Purposeful compression in revelation density taught early, legible at Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and density in animate lifeless tone, but patterned artifacts dull: "cascading revelations" x4 and "thread" x4 create paraphrase loops across revelation beats; template cadence ("It [action], [revelation]") in final third harms propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue in living library garden transforms stasis trope via structural weakness opportunities; foxglove duality enables non-obvious moral calculus on vulnerability as strength, risking lyric accumulative drive that coheres.</comment>
