<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's thoughtful trait drives concrete micro-choices like placing the drawer pull, earning her internal untethering with felt guilt cost; Kael's softening adds relational pressure. Internal conflict embodied in chest-tightening recall and steady voice. Minor label-speak ("uncommonly thoughtful") slightly abstracts without full trade-off visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Oriented early (parapet, mist, exchange); accumulative/textural lens holds as atmospheric density and admissions tighten to Charged Poise closure (lightness, drawer pull reprise) with emotional cost legible in "shed a heavy coat." One meaningful deepening via Kael's brother admission reweights stakes without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist, wind, and parapet concretely mirror tension (clinging shroud, furrowed hush) and evolve (mist thickens, then parts), constraining mood-driven choices; drawer pull as recurring micro-setting charges final image. Sensory selection POV-biased toward symbolism without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via exchange) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through Kael's admission narrowing to agreement; Elara's agency in proposing protocol forecloses revenge path with visible relational cost (shared losses). Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes emerges organically via drawer pull's shift from broken home to mended wisdom, resonating in final image without moralizing; subtext in silences and gestures invites ambiguity on forgiveness' fragility. Minor thematic echo in dialogue ("recycle that pain") borders platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (tactile anchors like drawer pull); voice modulates poetically under pressure. Dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Kael's rough admission), distinct from narration; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short tense sentences in dialogue beats); density high but minor paraphrase loops ("mist" x4, "wind" recurrences) and figurative density ("mist parting like a curtain") slightly dull propulsion in ending without obscuring closure. No template cadence or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of negotiation trope via tactile symbol and moon-synchronized ritual transforms into quiet redemption arc; drawer pull's evolving specificity avoids generic symbolism. Risks poetic tone without gimmickry, but premise echoes familiar peace talks.</comment>
