<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation pure and rooted in illustrator's patience drives sparing time use, but internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous impulses during sculpting; micro-choices like dipping oar reveal values under haste.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to on-page resonant reconfiguration as echoes burst and repayment lurches world backward with aging cost; single scene oriented early via canals and pendant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop canals constrain navigation and stretch tactilely like taffy during time-bend, charging spire arrival; sensory hierarchy suits illustrator's patient gaze amid urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncage via time-borrow tightens texturally as birds freeze and echoes strain, forcing precise unleashing; agency in whispering sculpted key forecloses with felt aging cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical balance emerges via infinity pendant and echoes weaving wind, reweighting interruption into harmony; final sketch offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature filters through illustrator's eye; rhythmic diction modulates from gliding calm to flare intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels but minor loops in "interrupted cadence" and "Elara [action]" stems across reflections dull mid-section slightly; metaphors integrate without muddle at peak flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Time-sculpting illustrator freeing echoes in canal-towers over giant's nap synthesizes fresh magical realism; risk in textural lyricism heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
