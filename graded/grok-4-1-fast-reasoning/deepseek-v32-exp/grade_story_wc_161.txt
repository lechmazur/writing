<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve songs roots choices consistently, intensifying via Leo's interest and letter confrontation; contradictory fear/trust impulses act in guarded replies turning to sharing. Internal conflict embodied in meteorite reveal and breakdown, earning authenticity shift with relational cost. Minor slips in label-speak like "learning to trust again" but not pivotal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from isolation to partnership via visits culminating in letter discovery (DC tightening). Closure RR (Charged Poise in skylight mapping/partnering) with felt vulnerability cost legible in "embraced her true history." Summary progression over weeks slightly outlines stakes without causality break; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting vivid/selective (aged paper, skylight dust motes) mirrors isolation-to-trust via mapping practice, constraining choices (pigeon training, letter find). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (whispering paper trails, meteorite talisman). Skylight/dust charges final image, guiding emotional equilibrium.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust to preserve songs) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Leo's resonance to letter reversal narrowing isolation option. Agency in sharing meteorite/embracing truth forecloses hiding with vulnerability cost. Letter beat tests commitment, altering tactics to collaboration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of authenticity from decay emerges organically via reinvented history unraveling to preservation partnership; blooming withering tone in dust mapping reprise reweights premise without moralizing. Final image (pigeons flying, skylight balance) offers non-literal resonance on trust/resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (dust swirls, paper whispers as emotional anchors); voice textured/poetic modulates from wary to open. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (curt replies to shared stories). No head-hopping; diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("lost songs" recurrence) and repetitive phrasing ("mapped the dust motes") dull mid-section without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies; no template cadence or filter stacks. Minor overwriting in summary weeks but clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pigeon-encoded songs/micro-engraved meteorite transforms trust trope via attic isolation to cosmic preservation. Risky poetic tone heightens emotional stakes; letter turn inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
