<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent motivation as resilient deckhand drives radio call and alignment choices to climax; interiority concrete in "heart soared" amid jumbled memories. Minor slip: positivity lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, told more than embodied in pivotal adjustment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: radio connects echo selves therefore patterns align therefore ferry merges in DC closure with felt struggle cost at "timelines trembled on the brink." Single scene anchors early (Eli, grotto, sideways time by para 2); one tightening via chorus suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto's shimmering walls/stalactites constrain choices via light patterns reflected in hourglass; starlight evolves from piercing to pulsing, charging final image. Sensory selection (damp planks, static crackle) filtered through deckhand priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to merge timelines signaled early, tightens via radio chorus narrowing to alignment under causal lens; agency in adjustments forecloses divergent realities with brink-tremble cost. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to DC.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilient weaving amid transience emerges via patterns/hourglass mirroring internal drive, resonant in "permanent transient beauty" final image reweighting premise without statement. Complexity lingers in scattered ferry's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature (deckhand hope amid sideways time); voice modulates rhythm in climax pulse. Radio dialogue natural/subtextual, advances plot; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere; rhythm varies with scene acceleration to "final adjustment." Minor purple drift ("fleeting instant that would define eternity") in peak but no loops or scaffold dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry vanish into timeline grotto merge via patterns/hourglass transforms multiverse trope organically; risk in sideways-time weave heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
