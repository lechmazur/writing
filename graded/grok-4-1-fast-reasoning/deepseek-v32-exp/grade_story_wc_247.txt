<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's joyful sorrow embodied in trembling hands during "Why have you chosen me?" sign and confident shift when mapping horizon; advisor's charisma fluidly shown but lacks a complicating flaw that tests connection at peak shared traversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from isolation to shared mapping to Elian's solo perception; CR closure in clutching camera as token of harmony reweights forgotten existence with legible emotional cost in final pang of sorrow/joy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (waves' percussion, breeze's violin) filtered through Elian's perceptual shift; recurring camera as micro-setting constrains framing quiet and charges final image, mirroring internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of isolation tightens accumulatively via deepening perception (advisor shows → joint traversal → Elian aims camera); cost felt in foreclosed loneliness but softened by unpressured farewell fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unsung ballads in silence emerges organically from mapping acts; final horizon framing offers resonant CR reweighting obscurity as timeless harmony without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature (silence as symphony); sign descriptions carry rhythmic subtext as action, modulating intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety supports lyric build, but minor paraphrase loops ("disrupt the...disrupting the") and repeated "silence" stems dull mid-traversal density without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of filmless camera framing void into music via signs transforms isolation trope; risk of lyric silence-perception heightens stakes inevitably to closure.</comment>
