<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in coin-casting persistence, but internal conflict summarizes doubt without simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, like "she wondered... yet her quiet enthusiasm never wavered."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from repeated casts to intensified bursts; on-page CR closure in "she understood: the prophecy was about the contraction itself" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of embracing doubt as anchor role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ambered deck, obsidian table, and coins provide tactile constraints on casting actions and charge final map image; selective sensory details like clinking coins and crackling speakers mirror internal pursuit without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of alignment signaled early tightens accumulatively via novel coin sequence narrowing doubt to realization; agency in distilling bursts forces stance crystallization with felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation from chaos emerges organically through coins and static echoes; resonant CR ending reweights contraction as transformation without moralizing, though prophecy statements verge overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cosmic perceptual signature in rhythmic diction like "clinked softly... wavelength align"; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("quiet enthusiasm" 3x, "distill" 3x, "cast the coins" 3x) create template cadence and synonym churn across beats, dulling propulsion; affects density in realization sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of contracted universe relic with coin divination transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in backwards prophecy frame heightens cosmic stakes organically.</comment>
