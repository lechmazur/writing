<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Elara's pacifism contradicts her father's violence through micro-choices like rejecting bounties for nurturing, embodied in whispering to plants; final endurance of chaos feels earned. Senseless perceptiveness enables plant empathy without label-speak overload. Minor flaw: therapy-like self-articulation of values slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from scrap discovery to plant robustness and visitor influence, culminating in CR closure where pollen spreads values with endurance cost. Orientation anchored early in dome/farm. One tightening via visitors tests method without causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Glass dome contrasts outer chaos, constraining choices to sanctuary nurturing; scrap/roots as micro-setting charge final image of enduring legacy. Sensory filter (plant emotions, air shifts) POV-specific. Desert roses evolve tactilely with plot.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (weave continuity) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as plants absorb scrap's essence amid intensifying chaos, narrowing to pacifist endurance. Cost legible in unwavering heart vs. encroaching darkness. Chaos remains abstract off-page, softening visceral pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of transforming violence into peace emerges via plant inculcation and scrap integration, reweighted in final pollen image without moralizing. Subtext in rejecting father's path layers ambiguity. Wanderer scene concretely ties motif to resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (plant feelings, air subtleties); voice lyrical and consistent, modulating to "tranquil blaze" motif. Visitor dialogue natural, goal-driven (sharing method). No head-hopping; rhythm purposeful under endurance pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Repetitive stems ("inculcating," "weave continuity," "tranquil blaze") create template cadence across paragraphs, dulling density (−0.6). Paraphrase loops in plant influence beats obscure propulsion. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist plants absorbing "engraved quiet" from scrap transforms post-tower tropes into value-imbuing beacon. Risky lyric accumulation feels inevitable in pollen spread. No derivative hedging; scrap's evolution personalizes ingenuity.</comment>
