<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak dominates realizations, e.g., "vulnerability was not weakness, but a doorway to genuine connection," flattening embodied emotion and contradictory impulses at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with CR closure in "cosmic janitor had become a star in his own right," felt cost of embracing imperfections legible in final embrace; minor lack of decisive density tightening pre-meteor beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass and station dome constrain observation choices and charge final "pulse against his heart" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Internal stake of vulnerability deepens accumulatively via meteor empathy, forcing admission of "loneliness, his fears" with emotional cost; no strong agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Resonant CR reweights fragility through star parallels, but direct thematic echoes like "strength in vulnerability" repeated undermine subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV with cosmic perceptual signature; rhythm modulates reflective calm effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops (e.g., "strength in vulnerability," "flourishing stillness" x3 each) and repetitive stems dull propulsion across reflections, including near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh cosmic janitor premise transformed via star-empathy synthesis feels organic and risks lyric reflection for thematic payoff.</comment>
