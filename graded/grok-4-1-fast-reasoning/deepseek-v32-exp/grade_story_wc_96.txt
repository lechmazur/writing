<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's molting trait yields concrete contradiction ("raw and renewed") that compels mission endurance; Leo's steadiness anchors without depth. Final friendship as unshaken costs prior cynicism, earned via prior cues. Minor epiphanies like "luminous fracture widen" feel told, not embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from debris crouch to dawn pack-up with charged poise closure ("beauty... because of it") reconfiguring anarchy as origin. One tightening via personality stir forecloses doubt; cost legible in "shed another skin, this friendship... unshaken." Orientation anchored by para 1; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rusted frame/debris constrains rebuilding choices; moon bookends charge final image ("moon... fading into dawn"). Sensory selective (whistling wind, waterlogged spine) via poet bias; spatial coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bloom resistance) signaled early; textural deepening via molt hopefulness narrows to endurance with felt cost (ongoing decay defiance). Poem tuck tests commitment; agency in sorting/touch forecloses isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blooming resistance emerges via shelves/poems without statement; final image ("luminous beginning") non-literally reweights anarchy as generative. Subtext in tin symbol; minor directness ("core concept... embodied") tempers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited (Elara perceptual signature: spines, verses); poetic rhythm modulates urgency. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("resistance needs this"); no head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive motif loops ("blooming resistance," "forge beauty from anarchy," "rebuild") across beats create paraphrase churn without pressure gain, dulling propulsion. Dense images strong, but overwriting metaphors (e.g., "luminous fracture") strain in peak reflection; rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Molt cycle + ex-prison library rebuild transforms vagrant redemption trope via textured resistance; fresh "penny poet" angle. Premise synthesis organic, risks lyric accumulation effectively.</comment>
