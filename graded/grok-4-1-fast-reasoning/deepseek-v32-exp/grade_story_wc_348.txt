<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Solid interiority rooted in profession ("surfactants and surface tension") and embodied grief (boots sinking, knot unraveling), with earned change via foam insight foreclosing avoidance. Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing ("atonement wasn't about erasing") borders therapy-speak but doesn't undermine pivotal motivation crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ravine images to foam insight tightening stake, landing Charged Poise closure ("motivation crystallized") with legible emotional cost in "grief loosened." Two-shard structure (ravine to lab) transitions cleanly; orientation anchored early by character/setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wet stone/decay, foam swirl) filter through chemist's bias, constraining choices (climbing down, tracing patterns) and charging final ravine returns. Chrysalis/stick as micro-setting reprise mirrors internal divergence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant atonement stake signaled early, deepens via foam reversal narrowing options from dirge to harmony project; agency in tracing forces trade-off with visible emotional cost ("tight knot... unravel"). Accumulative pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transient bonds emerges organically from foam/chrysalis particulars, resonating in polymer legacy without moralizing until late echo ("every end is a beginning"), docking score; final image reconfigures loss-to-connection non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with symphonic/chemical perceptual signature ("symphony of molecules"); rhythmic modulation fits reflective pressure, diction controlled (no dialogue to judge).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density advance beats, but paraphrase loops around "loosened grief"/"transient bonds" (e.g., foam to polymer reprise) and minor template stems ("He stood up... He presented") dull propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer chemistry with river foam insight transforms grief trope; symphonic lens and ravine-to-lab arc feel inevitable and risk reflective structure effectively.</comment>
