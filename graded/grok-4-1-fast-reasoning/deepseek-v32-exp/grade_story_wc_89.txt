<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reforge the bond drives concrete micro-choices like crushing spices despite fear; contradictory impulses peak in "Reluctantly, she let her human form unravel... yet she remained paradoxically steady," earning the final endurance with visible permanence cost. Minor summary dilutes some embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spices build density to conjure bridge (causal ellipsis), tightening via metamorphosis to RR closure where permanence forecloses human return, cost legible in "she could not return to her old self." Orientation anchored early in orchard; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory scents (saffron "like lost sunrises") constrain ritual choices on moss altar and charge final image of spiced memories solidifying Kael. Micro-setting via spices/proximity integrates purposefully, mirroring internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through reluctant metamorphosis narrowing options to permanent guardian role; cost unmistakable in solidified bond but irreturnable self. Agency in stepping onto bridge forces trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilient love-through-transformation emerges via spiced memories reforging bond; final image reweights loss into eternal sanctuary without moralizing, resonant via particulars like dissolving fortune.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with sensory-biased perception (spice aromas dominate); minimal dialogue natural ("For us"), subtext-laden. Capped by Q7 debt; perceptual signature consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn in final third ("orchard bloomed," "permanent moonlight," "scent of rare spices," "bond reforged" echoed redundantly) dull closure image; overwriting density (mixed metaphors like "fragrant and ethereal") obscures propulsion in peak ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy-tale orchard ritual with cookie fortune and spice afterlife bridge transforms tropes organically; fortune's odd mundanity heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via memory scent payoff.</comment>
