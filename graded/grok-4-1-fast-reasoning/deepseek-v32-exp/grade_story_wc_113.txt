<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through musician-specific actions like humming the opera; embodied realizations like chill signaling approval earn the final change. Internal conflict emerges in piecing stains to flood-as-opera, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with discoveries tightening to slap as decisive reconfiguration; closure legible in ghost's fade and water stilling with emotional cost of release. Single scene oriented early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flooded house and lanterns constrain wading pace and reveal secrets via water; recurring drips/plinks charge liminal hush, mirroring internal discovery and final memorial image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel code escalates accumulatively via stain/map revelations narrowing to water slap; agency in disruptions forecloses stagnation with ghost's fade as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of ruin-as-art emerges organically from flood-as-opera realization; final image reweights in-between spaces without moralizing, embracing decay's beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Musician-biased perception (unstruck chords, rests) yields distinct texture; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under rising energy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on "hush/silence" and "wordless conversation" slightly dull without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost legend with water-stain code and flood-as-composition transforms haunted house trope through musical logic.</comment>
