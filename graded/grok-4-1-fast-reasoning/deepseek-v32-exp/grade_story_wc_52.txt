<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in "hands steady despite the tremor in her soul," earning lighter heart at closure; practical grief feels particular. Minor label-speak ("hauntingly practical") slightly abstracts peak embodiment without full cost dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from blank wood to emergent lion head; Charged Poise closure in "contained her grief... finding here and gone reconciled" legible with emotional cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single tightening via intensifying whistle narrows focus effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skylight, ash grain, and kettle constrain carving choices and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (wet ash scent, rain taps) reflects urgent focus. Rust-hued light subtly mirrors internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to contain memories tightens via kettle cadence shift under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance with soul tremor cost; final lighter heart forecloses unchecked grief path. Agency in deliberate strokes legible, though internal pressure lacks external complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss transformed emerges organically from carving particulars, resonant CR in final reconciliation without moralizing. Returning ash grain shifts to "alive" stories, reweighting "here and gone"; avoids tidy binary via sad-sweet peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with grief-biased perceptual signature (wood as "blank slate for her sorrow"); rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise. Minor repetition risks committee voice feel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("crystallized time," "harvest lessons from loss") repeat across beats, dulling density; template cadence in motivation restatements (−0.6). Closure image clear despite artifacts; varied rhythm mostly propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh widow-carver synthesis transforms grief trope via ash lion symbol; carving timer risk heightens ingenuity. Prompt echoes slightly hedge boldness.</comment>
