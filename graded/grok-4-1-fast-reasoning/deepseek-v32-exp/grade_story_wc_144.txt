<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's blindness trait is embodied through tactile perception of vibrations and refractions, rooting her motivation in consistent sensory competence. Micro-choices like tracing circuits reveal values under time pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses in peak diagnosis beat, but endurance of calm forecloses rushed failure path with felt ship urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from jumbled signals to clear hum, tightening via patch verification. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with drone's twitch and flight, cost legible in anchor chains rattling during work ("chains rattling and groaning"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist and depot sounds (drip, hum, chains) evolve causally, mirroring internal harmony and constraining outdoor test in clinging shroud. Bowl of water as micro-setting enables refraction method, charging final mist image. Sensory hierarchy blind-POV specific: air pressure, oil scents over visuals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode drone for ship nav) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via chaotic feedback to verified patch under anchor-lift clock. Agency in patient method forecloses failure option; cost felt in depot sounds shifting to ship's movement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of deeper sight in brokenness emerges via refraction method and final harmony image reweighting blindness as strength. Resonance from particulars like drone reprise without moralizing; invites ambiguity in her "unique" perception versus physical limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with blind perceptual signature (fingertip temperature changes, echoes). Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in calm under stress. No dialogue; compression of diagnosis beat purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density ("dust motes into a harmonious dance"; "gentle as a lover's caress") in most diagnosis sentences dulls propulsion without payoff, −0.6. Minor paraphrase loops on repair success ("stirred...twitching...hum"; "success in the air"). Strong verbs and sensory propulsion otherwise sustain rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh blind refraction-via-touch for drone nav transforms artisan trope organically. Calm under maiden-voyage clock risks stasis but synthesizes into charged poise. Non-obvious hummingbird-ship link inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
