<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in ritual actions like key-turning and counting; embodied in hand weight and squint. Internal doubt emerges as "razor edges" contradicting precision belief. Minor slip: final acceptance feels summarily epiphanic without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density (reversals, glints) builds to CR closure in "clocks measure...human desire to carve permanence from flux," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of illusion accepted on-page. Orientation anchored early in station/whistle. One tightening via reversed count slowing world suffices; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station's water clocks and horizon constrain calibration choices, charging final clear-sight image. Sensory mix (gurgles, glints, sun) filters via precision-obsessed POV. Evolving details (gear flash, blurring line) mirror internal shift without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe time's substance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via count reversal narrowing perception to insight. Agency in adjustments forecloses control illusion with felt peace cost. No reversal overload; one deepening charges end under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of measurement as resistance/illusion emerges from gear-water particulars, resonating in final horizon clarity without moral. Subtext in motif shifts (sharp edges to fluid reality). Minor overtness in "truth lies in the quiet" borders statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias toward precision (razor edges, drips). Voice texture rhythmic/poetic, modulating from charged ritual to serene stasis. No elision issues; diction fits solitary technician lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Repetitive stems/phrases ("after blowing the whistle," "fjord quiet," "eminently peculiar") create template cadence runs across ≥3 sentences, dulling propulsion (−1.2). Paraphrase loops restate mystery (e.g., counting drifts to insight redundantly). Density varies but artifacts pervade final third, capping high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hydraulic clocks/fjord frame fresh angle on time as friction, synthesized organically via water-gear metaphors. Motif risks (reversed count) heighten stakes inventively without gimmick.</comment>
