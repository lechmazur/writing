<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find courage roots in broken leash fear, embodied in frayed nerves and uncoiling tension, with micro-choices to follow guides earning her final resolve. Guides apply gentle pressure via indirect routes, revealing character through trust. Minor slip: realization "courage...within the journey itself" borders unearned epiphany without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mist, routes, stamp builds to Charged Poise CR on shore, reweighting leash break with cost of vast emptiness transformed. Orientation anchored early (leash, ridgeway). Single tightening via star sigil and canyon wisdom narrows to internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway, pines, streams constrain via indirect paths, charging closure shore image. Sensory hierarchy (scents, waves) reflects Elara's soothing amid fear. Micro-setting (oak, star) guides punch choice and final gleam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find courage) signaled early, textural escalation via routes/mist/echoes forces endurance, culminating in shore stance with felt cost of untethered terror. One deepening realization narrows fear to resilience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of journey-born courage emerges via particulars (leash, star, shore), final image reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in guides' indirection invites ambiguity on trust's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (fear to resolve). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates tension, dialogue sparse/natural/subtextual ("indirect routes"). No head-hopping, voice distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (slow vigil to moonrise), density high via integrated sensory/action. Minor artifact: "shoreline lullaby" x4 borders loop but patterns motif payoff at end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic guides/ridgeway into internal vigil, transforming leash trope via star sigil and indirect routes. Risky lyric accumulation heightens quiet closure without gimmick.</comment>
