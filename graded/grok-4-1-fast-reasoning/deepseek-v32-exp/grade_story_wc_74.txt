<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via accumulating visions, compelling her ritual; interiority concrete but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal painting beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of visions tightening to CR closure ("global network... shared human truth"); cost legible in endured insomnia and ongoing quest.</comment>
