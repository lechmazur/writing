<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity vs dread shows contradictory impulses, embodied in heart flutter and fierce resolve leading to earned acceptance. Final renunciation of conquest feels motivated by prior visions' risk to her mind. Weakness: bathroom epiphanies declare insight without deeper internal conflict dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from whispers to visions to CR closure: placing cameo at roots reconfigures her from pursuer to curator, with felt cost of foreclosed forbidden knowledge in "hard-won peace." Orientation anchored early in orchard/asteroid. One tightening via fruit vision narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ozone scent, pulsing fruit) filter through Elara's priorities, constraining inquiries via tree responses and charging final roots image. Micro-setting of cameo and bathroom basin guides epiphanies tactilely. Atmosphere tensions wonder/dread coherently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forbidden knowledge tightens accumulatively via vision reversal, forcing agency in acceptance with legible mind-unraveling cost. Pressure coheres internally without coincidence resolution. Escalation driven by her demands and realizations under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as lived process emerges organically from cameo gaps and orchard echoes, answered non-literally by final placement reweighting inheritance. Subtext in silences and visions invites ambiguity without confusion. No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical 3rd-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of cosmic wonder/dread; diction/rhythm modulate from frustration to peace. Minimal whispers natural/subtextual, advancing stakes. Consistent cosmic idiom suits Elara without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, density high via multi-job lines; motifs like "brightened disquiet" purposeful without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in epiphany phrasing ("breakthrough," "realization") dull peak baths slightly. No closure artifacts; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astral orchard and time-skipping artifacts transforms tropes into inevitable CR; cameo blank's erasure as "gap in time" risks boldly without gimmick. Nonlinear inheritance feels organically lived, heightening stakes uniquely.</comment>
