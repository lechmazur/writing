<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in donor heart pulses concretely and ties to closure realization; interiority particular via stained hands and light focus. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the ritual beat, leaning on summary labels like "quietly explosive" without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from wing alignment to symbol revelation; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in crumbling wing and reweighted identity. Orientation anchored early; one deepening via shifting symbols suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tea house's open sides and thermal drift enable sun trails, constraining the ritual; recurring wing charges final image as micro-setting. Sensory details (creaking deck, mist shroud) filtered through dye master's iridescent bias without catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (story-magnetism) signaled early; accumulative escalation via intensifying light patterns to vortex images narrows to realization under lens. Agency in precise alignment forecloses wing with visible cost, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of story-magnets as "iridescent caution" emerges organically via light symbols mirroring protagonist's arc. Final CR reweights premise non-literally without moralizing, lingering in heart-story web.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/dye observations; voice texture modulates poetically from calm setup to revelation glow. No head-hopping or elision; diction biased to character's watchful idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines in ritual; rhythm varies for propulsion. Light/shimmering synonym churn and stacked iridescent metaphors slightly muddle peak illumination beat, dulling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye master, donor heart magnetism, and wing ritual transforms fantasy tropes via sun-trail mechanics. Risky lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
