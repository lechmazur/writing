<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rarefy scars into poetry is consistent and intensifies to compel writing the poem under timer pressure. Interiority concrete via scar reflections, but contradictory impulses summarized rather than acting simultaneously in pivotal writing beat. Stranger's late arrival adds pressure but minimal crucible testing prior to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of storm, timer, scars builds to CR closure in poem-sharing image with felt cost of past silence broken. Orientation anchored early (observatory, poet's vigil). Timer provides one meaningful tightening; stranger emergence culminates pattern without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory vividly selective (thunder trembles dome, lightning flashes reveal face in telescope), mirroring turmoil and charging scar-constellation realization. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to poetic immediacies; setting guides telescope approach constraining epiphany. Environment evolves with intensifying storm, affecting emotional choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode scars, break censorship) signaled early, tightens texturally via timer countdown and reflection to poem-writing agency. Stranger crystallizes stance; visible cost in foreclosed silence felt on page. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of scars as resilient maps emerges organically from reflections and poem, resonant in final shared gaze without overt moralizing until late whisper. Subtext in mask-slipping and rarefying builds ambiguity around healing cost. Final image reweights prior turmoil non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (storm as turmoil mirror, scars as constellations). Voice texture distinct in syntax/rhythm modulating from fury to poise; brief dialogue natural, goal-driven (redemption via "your poetry can heal"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("vigil in pause," "sealed envelope wedged," "furiously tranquil") across paragraphs dull density (−1.2); synonym churn on scars/storm in reflective blocks. Rhythm varies but overwriting in peak timer-beat with stacked modifiers obscures propulsion. Closure image clean despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scars-cartography and rarefying poetry transforms censorship trope via observatory vigil and timer cadence. Stranger-redemption arc familiar but grounded in envelope clue. Risks poetic compression effectively without gimmickry.</comment>
