<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in arsonist father strongly compels graft choice, earning redemption with felt lineage cost; interior conflict embodied in humming father's tune during procedure. Girl's trust adds crucible pressure via flinch micro-choice. Minor slip: abstract "unyielding compassion" edges toward label-speak without full contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (sand paste, coin, clouds) tightens to Charged Poise closure where girl's song reconfigures scars' meaning with emotional cost legible in "her own redemption." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. No causal breaks; micro-turn at flinch resolves into stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Black sand micro-setting constrains graft (mixed into paste) and charges final image clinging to hands; obsidian lagoon reflects transformation purposefully. Sensory hierarchy (sharp sand under boots, lapping water) filters through Elara's compassionate POV. Clouds/kelp evolve subtly, mirroring peace without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove scars sing) signaled early; textural deepening via graft intensifies density, narrowing to endurance of girl's flinch with relational cost. Low external pressure limits escalation band; agency in smoothing graft forecloses despair path but lacks live trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-beauty emerges organically from graft and song; final image reweights scars without moral. Direct whisper "Scars are like stories... they sing" creates minor echo (-0.4), diluting subtext in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (graceful poise noticing kelp-drift); rhythm modulates from alert to serene. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("Today, we help your scars find their voice"). No head-hopping; diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short procedural sentences amid poetic breaths); density high but clouds/sand/peace motifs loop thrice without full payoff (-0.5 paraphrase). No scaffold in closure; figurative coherent (scars sing). Minor overwriting dulls graft peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arson-daughter firefighter grafts volcanic sand skin on obsidian beach, coin reprices past losses uniquely. Tropes (healing scars) transformed via textural peace amid fire lineage; risks poetic stasis successfully.</comment>
