<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to chart healing roots consistently in her solitary craft, with embodied empathy via the warm thread contrasting her chill isolation. Interiority particularizes grief through projections, showing contradictory impulses in honoring others' absences while tracing her own. Final endurance of lonesome splendor earns a meaningful renunciation of rushed filling, with felt cost in her fractured soul mending slowly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from setup (Elara sits, coils thread) to CR closure: "healing comes from honoring the empty places," reweighting absences with conceptual cost in the dulling thread and fading projection. Single scene oriented by ~50 words (harbor empty, garden shadows). No breaks; pattern of memory-weaving tightens to her self-realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden's skeletal trees, damp bench, rustling leaves, and decay scent selectively mirror internal states, narrowing to thread's warmth amid chill during projection peak. Recurring thread as micro-setting constrains her method and charges final image (dulls, purpose fulfilled). Sensory hierarchy reflects empathic POV; autumn evolution ties to endings theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart healing via Kael's obituary) signaled early, texturally escalates through projection's vivid memories deepening to her own absences, forcing endurance of solitude. Agency in weaving thread forecloses void-filling path, with cost legible in pulsing fade and "first glimmer of peace." One tightening suffices under lens; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of tangled healing emerges implicitly from projections revealing "absences are not voids but spaces where love once lived," resonating in final image of dull thread and calm sea without moral statement. Particulars like carpet memories and her lost home reweight premise organically. Subtext in solitude's splendor invites ambiguity on recovery's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, with perceptual signature (geography metaphors, memory textures) modulating rhythm from quiet setup to charged projection. Syntax varies for emotional intensity; diction character-specific (weft "stitch," "map"). No elision issues; compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propulsive with varied openings and lengths, high density in projection beats integrating sense/action. Minor paraphrase loops ("lonesome splendor" thrice, "projecting presence" repeated) but pattern-taught and voice-motivated; no closure muddle. Metaphors coherent (thread weaving fabric of recovery); strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituary-for-living via magical thread transforms loss tropes into textured healing map, with bold lyric risk in projection scenes heightening empathic stakes. Premise commits to absence-projection logic without retreat; final self-mending feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
