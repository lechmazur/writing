<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Face-blind trait uniquely drives insight into relationships via non-facial cues, rooting motivation in consistent methodical compulsion; final realization earned through embodied process without unearned epiphanies. Minor flaw: minimal contradictory impulses shown in scene, favoring smooth competence over raw struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory impressions and opposites build density to CR closure: ribbon's finery vs. rock unifies into accident realization ("truth had fallen into the mist") with legible cost of lost empathy. Single scene anchors orientation early; one tightening via imagined event suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded quarry vividly filters through Elara's bias (ghostly shadows hold breath), constraining pacing and charging final image; sensory hierarchy narrows under her drive. "Damp air settled into the fibers" tactilely mirrors internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken empathy) signaled early, deepens via unifying opposites into realization; agency in methodical pacing forecloses murder premise with conceptual cost of "failed attempt to lance the swelling secret." Escalation coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of literal/figurative blindness and unified opposites emerges organically from ribbon-quarry contrast and accident repricing, inviting reflection on empathy's death without moralizing; final story-drawing offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (arrangements of lines/shadows over faces); rhythmic prose modulates introspection, diction biased toward tactile precision. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("boots scuffing on wet stone"); varied rhythm avoids loops, though minor metaphor density ("mist clung like a shroud") borders overwriting without muddling closure. Clean syntax emphasizes key images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist "translating souls" to reprice cold case via opposites feels inevitable; risk in abstract method heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
