<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Label-speak dominates ("Her nature was steadily adaptive") over embodied micro-choices; interiority abstracts epiphanies without contradictory impulses acting in scene, flattening emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with frost-ledger pattern tightening to CR closure ("She stood, ready... purpose clear") and felt cost in forged resolve; single scene oriented early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frost patterns vividly constrain deciphering ("held the ledger strip against the frost") and charge final image ("frost melted, but the patterns remained in her mind"); sensory selection purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose amid threat) signaled but lacks meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens; internal realization softens pressure without narrowing options or visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation emerges organically from frost/ledger/light images reweighting fear to resolve; final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, though repetition dilutes subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeing; rhythmic poetic texture coherent, modulating to charged poise, unmarred by head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate ("drifting resonance" x4, "patterns" x6, "retracing" x3) with template cadence in reflective ending; overwriting muddles propulsion in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Frost-as-decoder ingeniously fuses art/smuggling tropes into fresh Accumulative arc; risk in lyric reflection pays off without gimmickry, transforming survival into luminous purpose.</comment>
