<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied motivation (sharp ache driving ritual) and contradictory impulses (willing perplexity embraces confusion yet compels deliberate micro-choices like palm-pressing). Final reclamation earned via prior causality, foreclosing regret path with felt cost in weaving thread. No unearned epiphanies; interiority concrete and particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to gateway climax ("crack widened, becoming a gateway"). On-page RR/CR closure ("wove it into the tablecloth... peace settle") with legible conceptual cost (honoring over recovery) reconfiguring options. Anchors clear by para 1; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (silver grass, swirling clouds) and objects (glowing saucer, embroidered cloth) constrain choices and charge final image (saucer sealed with starlight). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (choking beauty mirrors throat-tight emotion). Purposeful integration via pulse and gateway evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repent lost time) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ritual deepening (cards to gateway reach). Agency in weaving forecloses recovery path with visible cost (leave saucer, descend). Escalation coheres under lens, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (hand-tracings, time-thread): repentance reweights lost innocence without moralizing. Final image ("choking beauty... sweet weight") offers non-literal resonant answer, inextricable from arc. Complexity lingers in acceptance's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with distinct perceptual signature (mist/memory fusion). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity (rustle in silence to pulse/glade surge). Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images advance ritual without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies (short incantation sentences heighten surge). Figuratives coherent/purposeful ("liquid time" clouds); no artifacts dull closure weave.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartomancy/tea-saucer relic transforms time-regret trope via cloud-ritual and hand-cloth anchor. Risky fantasy glade feels inevitable; closure's thread-weave inflects from particulars without gimmick.</comment>
