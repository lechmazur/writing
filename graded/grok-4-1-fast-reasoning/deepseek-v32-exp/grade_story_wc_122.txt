<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in numbness drives concrete micro-choices like tracing drum and slotting needle; embodied via fingertips and tears. Internal contradiction between yearning and isolation acts in scene. Minor slips in epiphanic phrasing like "thawing the ice within" prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds vibration density to CR closure via tears and needle imprint, reweighting silence with emotional cost legible in "tears welled... of reawakening." Orientation anchored early; two shards cohere with one transition; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cavern's wood/hides and phonograph constrain choices (needle slotting, vibrations felt); recurring rustle charges final image syncing transformation. Sensory hierarchy touch-dominant reflects deafness. Object-as-setting (needle) elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via chaotic pulse to primal beats narrowing to soul-etching; agency in reverse-play and conducting forecloses isolation with tear-cost. One tightening suffices; pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-music emerges via reversed vibrations and hush motif shifting to bridge; resonant final image recharges without moral. Penalty for near-thematic echo in "defeat emotional numbness was not about drowning out silence," replacing peak pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with touch-biased perceptual signature; lyric rhythm modulates intensity. Signs as dialogue natural/subtextual. Minor repetition convergence but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density but hush/silence paraphrase loops and repetitive "rustle" phrasing dull propulsion across three+ instances; metaphor density overwrites peak vibrations beat without payoff. Rhythmic variety holds but artifacts cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, reversed songs, broken needle in drum cavern transforms silence trope into tactile music; risk-taking in textural hush heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight via filament payoff.</comment>
