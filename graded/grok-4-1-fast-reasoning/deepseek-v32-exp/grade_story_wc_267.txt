<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to understand safety's cost roots deeply in traits like nerve regeneration's hyper-awareness, compelling archive dives; internal conflict between duty and truth acts in micro-choices like pocketing the bolt. Final resolve to remain endures with felt cost of willful ignorance. Minor slip: epiphanies occasionally label rather than fully embody in peak reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (bolt, piano fix, tragedy) build density to pattern break (silence as choice), culminating in CR closure where resolve reweights silence with conceptual cost of endurance. Orientation anchored early in fortress routine. One tightening via archives suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, snow, spiral staircase vividly constrain choices (dusting reveals bolt) and charge final image (snow sealing vs. internal thaw). Sensory selection (cold halls, rusty smear) reflects POV urgency; setting mirrors frostbitten hope without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (staircase discoloration) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand safety's cost) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through discoveries narrowing ignorance to resolve; agency in seeking archives forecloses blind routine with cost of knowledge's burden. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in final stance. Minor abstractness in stakes' declaration vs. visceral tests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of safety's cost as buried truth emerges organically from bolt-to-tragedy arc, reweighted in final image of owned silence refusing pardon. Subtext in recurring silence motif invites ambiguity without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: warming resolve thaws frostbitten hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of tingling nerves and hushed hyper-awareness; voice texture (seraphic phrasing) modulates with intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled, perceptual bias filters setting purposefully. Prose reflects embodied fragility under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("unpardonable silence," "frostbitten hope") teaching pattern; rhythm varies, propulsion strong in discovery beats. Minor paraphrase loops in reflections (e.g., silence as "choice" restated adjacent) dull slightly but don't touch closure. No major artifacts in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silent-choir bellhop's bolt discovery unlocks fortress's buried tragedy, transforming silence trope into textured endurance. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; irreplaceable particulars like discoloration method feel inevitable to resolve.</comment>
