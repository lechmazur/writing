<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen's chef-gift motivation drives embodied choices like tasting regrets as "bitter notes" and trembling at the pillar, earning his integrative endurance; contradictory caution vs. healing impulses act in-scene without labels. Final resolve hardens with cost to his own memories. Minor slip in occasional stock phrasing like "wave of sadness" unembodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: post-rain descent links to pavilion entry and absorption density, culminating in Charged Poise RR where remorse integrates ("heart full of remembrances made smooth") with felt cost of self-alteration. Orientation anchors by para 2; one tightening via pillar touch narrows to personal price. Cost legible in "his own memories stirred, rough edges smoothed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavilion's "icy coral walls shimmering with captured tears" and courtyard puddles constrain touches and mirror emotional flow, charging final "glimmer beneath the dunes." Sensory hierarchy chef-biased (tastes, textures); evolves with melting bonds. Recurrent tidal pools ground reflection without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to subsume remorse escalates accumulatively via contagious grief density ("air thick with shared sorrow") forcing cautious integration; pillar touch deepens with self-cost. Agency in methodical reshaping forecloses overload path. Climax cost unmistakable but minor abstractness in "torrent of others' pains."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of remorse transformation emerges organically via tasting/blending actions, resonant in final forgiveness spice without moralizing. Complexity in integration's ambiguity lingers. Protagonist arc inextricable from healing question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with chef-perceptual signature (memories as flavors, textures); rhythmic modulation builds texture under pressure. Purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly. No head-hopping; minor drift in elevated diction at peak ("palatable essence").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("subsume" x3, "analyzing tidal pool formations" x3, "at the close of an unspoken dream" x3, "sandpaper rough memories" x3, "sturdy brittle" x3) create template cadence and paraphrase churn across beats, dulling propulsion; dense figuratives (e.g., every sentence in pavilion entry) obscure without consistent payoff. Closure image muddled by redundancy. Rhythm varies but scaffold drags mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of memory-tasting chef, desert coral pavilion, and remorse absorption feels inevitable and riskily bold, transforming healing tropes via specific craft metaphors. Final image recharges motifs organically. Non-obvious premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
