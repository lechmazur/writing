<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to bridge known/unknown via empathy is rooted in consistent traits and drives choices like video comparison, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete yet repetitive in labeling "methodically curious." Strengths in micro-choices aligning with perceptive nature under low pressure. Minor slips don't touch closure change in deepened empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, density builds from map alignment to video shadows to fissure widening, tightening to CR closure where whole map reweights tear's divide with felt conceptual cost in "soften[ed] divide." Orientation anchored early at henge. Single scene coherent, one meaningful deepening via footage comparison suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (mossy stones, damp stone, mist) selective via POV bias, constrain choices like tracing fissure mirroring map tear; rain-scoured vault evolves causally as entrance clears. Vault and henge charge final image of renewed space. Micro-setting (fissure/tool) guides climax action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reopen chapel via interpreting silence signaled early, tightens once via video-revealed shift narrowing to fissure; agency in deliberate tool use forecloses inaction path. Cost legible in shielded openness protecting from overwhelm. Low external pressure limits escalation depth under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as empathetic language emerges organically from map tear, videos, chapel map; final image of wholeness reconfigures premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "profound silence... full of unspoken stories." Avoids tidy resolution via lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in noticing shadows/fissures; rhythmic modulation builds to chapel entry. No dialogue. Minor repetition in phrasing slightly dulls texture under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("methodically curious," "shielded openness," "rain-scoured fresco vault") create paraphrase churn across paragraphs, dulling density; e.g., vault description restated 4x without new pressure. Rhythm varies but template stems in interiority ("she felt") stack. Artifacts don't obscure closure but drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map-framing, silent videos, whispered chapel transforms exploration trope via textural silence motif. Ingenuity in video comparison revealing celestial shifts points to fissure. Risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off at CR without gimmickry.</comment>
