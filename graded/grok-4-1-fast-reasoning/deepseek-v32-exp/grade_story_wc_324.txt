<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving assurance at climax, but interiority relies on summary labels like "persistently curious nature" rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; no embodied conflict in urging "Tell me your name."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pulses guiding to bench revelation then dissipation; on-page RR closure in final image of Elara alone as hero with felt cost of cold endurance and oblivion's weight; orientation anchored early in atrium details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist and twilight constrain movement via pulses and parting for ghost; bench and hearing aid as micro-settings charge final image of calm hush; sensory hush deepens purposefully with emotional cadence without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting voice tightens accumulatively via intensifying pulses to ghost's tale then peace; agency in assurances forecloses silence with felt dedication cost; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Remembrance theme emerges organically from pulses amplifying silenced voice to final "war against oblivion"; resonant non-literal closure reweights conduit role without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pulse/hush noticing; voice texture poetic yet consistent, modulating to sacred quiet; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven in assurances.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with integrated sensory action, but minor paraphrase loops on "pulses" and "assured" across beats dull propulsion slightly; rhythm varies without template cadence in peak ghost appearance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh hearing aid as heart-tracer transforms ghost trope via pulses and inherited role; incidental heroism synthesizes organically without hedging.</comment>
