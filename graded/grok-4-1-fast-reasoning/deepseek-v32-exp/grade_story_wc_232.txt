<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Empirically intuitive trait drives micro-choices like following glimmer and ants, earning climax refusal; minor slip in overt epiphany at "understood that some promises are kept not by changing what was."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from shop glimmer to chip, ants, cavern, and doorway refusal holds tightly under Causal lens; Earned Stasis closure legible with cost at "water rose to his ankles," foreclosing past alteration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming cavern's bioluminescent glow and rising water constrain climax choice and charge final wade-out; recurring glimmers filter through POV's observational bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to honor promise via doorway tightens causally through creek rise and cavern trickle; agency in refusal forces trade-off with visible water cost, charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honoring promises through acceptance emerges organically via quest particulars; resonant CR in subdued chip and "ants had led him home...to a peace," reweighting vow without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory action without loops; minor repetition of "glimmer" in cavern beat slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map dealer, printing chip key, and ant trail transforms mythical quest trope; risk in empirical path to refusal heightens stakes organically.</comment>
