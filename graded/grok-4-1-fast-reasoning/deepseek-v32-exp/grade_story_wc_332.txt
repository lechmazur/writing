<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, intensifying as she pours her longing into the light at climax; micro-choices like adjusting exposure reveal values under pressure. Interiority concrete in "heart ached with recognition" but leans abstract elsewhere, with emotions named ("profound peace") over fully embodied contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup in light-painting streaks resolving to dream form; orientation anchored early via jetty and pre-dawn hush. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page in "dream hung... dissolving into the rising sun," with legible cost in palette dimming and dream's freedom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting via palette and camera constrain choices, charging final image as wells dim; sensory details like "streaks of gold and violet swirled" selective and purposeful. Archipelago murmurs mirror internal states without overt symbolism; spatial choreography coherent on jetty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing dream) signaled early, tightens texturally as dream resists swirling mist, forcing persistence and pouring of longing; agency in vigorous painting forecloses non-action path. Cost legible in spent light and dream's temporary pulse before dissolution, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of longing decoded through particulars emerges organically, reweighted in mother's image smiling sadly; final line offers resonant non-literal answer via "new beginning, etched in light and memory." Avoids moralizing, embraces ambiguity of freedom vs. possession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in light-focused noticing (e.g., "wisp of silver and blue"); voice lyrical and consistent, modulating rhythm in climax painting sequence. Purposeful compression in whispers and light suits textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short urgent sentences in climax ("She persisted..."); high density in painting beats. Minor paraphrase loops in light descriptions ("painting with light," "weave light") subtract slightly but don't obscure closure; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian-dreamcatcher via sunrise photography transforms tropes; risk in light-painting physics feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Premise committed fully, no derivative templates.</comment>
