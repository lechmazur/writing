<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive diagnostic labels like "brittle devotion" (thrice) and "lukewarm power" flatten embodied contradiction during fatigue-waver beat; strengths in naive persistence driving micro-choices like blood-wipe and final invocation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via ritual density build to on-page DC (bell rings, river stirs) with fatigue cost at "Elian sank to his knees"; single scene anchors orientation instantly, no waiver needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's dew dripping constrains method choice and charges closure ring; sensory selection (cool stone, hum) mirrors internal pulse without catalog, body as micro-setting via cut finger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild to right imbalance) tightens texturally via cut-finger reversal and fatigue deepening options; cosmic scale felt viscerally in river stir but abstraction lingers pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Naive faith triumph emerges from particulars like flaring magic despite mediocrity; final fish leap reconfigures "plausible impossibility" as resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature on dripping rates biases details character-specifically; rhythmic modulation accelerates to closure hum without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Synonym loops ("brittle devotion"/"earnest heart/naive" thrice each) and paraphrase redundancy in doubt beats create template cadence mid-story; vivid images propel but artifacts dull density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Dripping rates of starlight on sapphire" offers fresh causal ingenuity transforming mage inadequacy trope; synthesis feels inevitable in ritual-to-ring arc.</comment>
