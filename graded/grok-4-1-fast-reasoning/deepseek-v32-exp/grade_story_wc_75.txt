<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rescue dying arts intensifies through embodied failures like the "sad, hard loaf," compelling the cliff harvest; interior contradiction between dread and fire peaks credibly in bone-chilling disappointment before self-reliant thaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries layer density to CR closure in "profound, cultural thaw," with cost legible in "scaling the slippery rocks"; shards transition legibly, pattern taught early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto mist and eastern cliff succulents constrain harvest choice and charge final baking image; rosewater dread evolves tactilely from funeral bouquet to nourishing warmth, mirroring thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing bread art tightens accumulatively at lens scratches narrowing to local honey; agency in failed reconstruction and cliff scaling forecloses beekeeper reliance with on-page cost of clumsy letters and slippery ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-won thaw emerges organically from ledger, failed loaf, and lens reveal; final "swirling 'E'" reconfigures external gift premise without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in persistent dread joined by warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature filters through historical bias, e.g., "curated archive of lost times"; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in baking scent, elders' dialogue natural/subtextual despite brevity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax, purposeful figurative layering like "rosewater dread" motif; minor overwriting in opening sensory stack slightly dulls early propulsion but spares closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lens scratches as hyper-local recipe reveal transforms lost-art trope into inevitable self-reliance synthesis; risk of mosaic shards heightens cultural thaw ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
