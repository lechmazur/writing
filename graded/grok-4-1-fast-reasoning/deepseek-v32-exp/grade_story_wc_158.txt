<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to photosynthesize pain into beauty roots every action consistently, with shy persistence embodied in secluded fervor. Internal endurance culminates in first rest, earning subtle change. Minor flaw: contradictory impulses summarized rather than acting simultaneously, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density builds from shell/postcard to echoed lullabies tightening stake. Orientation anchored early (poet in shell, eternal nights). Closure as Charged Poise in final rest/postcard tattoo reconfigures longing with felt cost of dissolved centuries; legible cost in "pain into a beauty that would never fade."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell vividly constrains (deepest chamber pools silence, amplifies wind), charging final glow. Sensory hierarchy poetic/embodied (pearlescent arches, off-key sighs). Reef-shadow joy mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, evolving to harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pain-to-beauty alchemy) signaled early; one deepening via returned echoes narrows isolation to influence under accumulative lens. Agency in persistent writing/endurance forecloses endless longing with cost of solitude. Pressure coheres to triad climax without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Blossom armistice emerges organically from cosmic-earthly shift, reweighting pain premise in final seeded truth. Subtext in skewed melodies/authenticity avoids tidy morals. Resonant non-literal answer in tattooed peace, lingering ambiguity of shy triumph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature (cosmic longing filters shell). Voice modulates rhythmically, lyric compression taught early. Purposeful repetition serves accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "shyly unstoppable," "ensconce" restatements across paragraphs) and synonym churn dull propulsion. Dense figuratives coherent but overwrite high-pressure echo return. Template cadence in motif recaps (e.g., shell sanctuary runs) creates drag, touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: insomniac shell-dweller photosynthesizing pain via cosmic postcard transforms isolation tropes. Shyly unstoppable attribute risks bold surrealism, inevitable in hindsight reprise. Bold lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
