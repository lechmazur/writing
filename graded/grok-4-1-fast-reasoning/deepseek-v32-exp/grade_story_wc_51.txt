<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through each burden; interior shift from trapped to expanded earned via whalebone reverie. Contradictory impulses (trapped yet weaving) act in scene, but embodied struggle lacks raw contradiction in peak calcifications. Final endurance of endless task shows hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via successive calcifications to RR closure in golden lattice linking burdens, reconfiguring trapped state with felt cost of infinity embraced. Continuous scene anchored early; one tightening via love's synthesis suffices. Cost legible in "collection was endless."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and starlight constrain via reflections guiding work when lamp dims; kerosene lamp handled tactilely, its waning forces starlight reliance in hope beat. Sensory hierarchy vivid (shingled hush absorbs tremors). Environment charges final pulse and exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burdens) signaled early; accumulative deepening via escalating resistances (grief resists, fear overwhelms) narrows to love's multifaceted demand, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in orienting calcifies each; visible cost in focus and dimming lamp alters tactics. Closure cost unmistakable in enriched infinity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of burdens as transformative art emerges organically from calcifications; final lattice and lifted weights offer resonant non-literal answer to entrapment, reweighting infinity without moral. Complexity in hope's deceptive heaviness lingers. No direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractal patterns, shingled hush); rhythmic modulation peaks in reverie shifts. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, prose as character in weaving precision. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, syntax supports weave-like cadence. Minor loops in "orienting properly" purposeful under accumulative lens, but "after first snowmelt" repeat borders redundancy without full payoff. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-weaving premise transforms emotional burdens into artifacts; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via orienting method. Bold synthesis of reverie and hush feels singular vision.</comment>
