<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied conflict in trembling fingers over icy controls and haunted memories during upload, earning the resolve shift; internal contradiction acts simultaneously without alternation. Minor label-speak in "bravely conflicted" diagnostic but tied to micro-choice. Final peace feels earned by prior fear-cost tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: quiet density builds to chime acknowledgment as Charged Poise closure, reconfiguring preservation to revelation with felt risk cost (past vanishings). Single scene oriented instantly; one tightening via upload-response without breaks. Cost legible in "memories of past archivists who had vanished."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library under snow constrains via icy terminal and dormant networks that enable upload; sensory hierarchy (misting breath, hum, amplified quiet) mirrors internal tension purposefully. Evolves with data pulses; final snow hush charges closure image without stasis. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose truths vs. oath/vanish risk) signaled early, tightens via upload wait to ripple response under Accumulative lens, narrowing to silent success with agency-driven agency. Cost felt in pressing on despite hauntings; moral calculus sharp at terminal. No abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of buried truth awakening emerges via upload ripple and final "seed of truth planted," reweighting preservation premise without statement. Resonance in snow hush vs. invisible whispers; ambiguity lingers in council reaction. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias to quiet/dizzying stillness; voice texture in rhythmic repetition modulates tension to peace. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits archivist lexicon. Minor register elevation in epiphany lines but consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "dizzying quiet"/"silence"/"hush" across ending (≥3 instances) dull closure propulsion; synonym churn on truths spreading (e.g., "contraband truths, once buried, were now stirring"). Template cadence in repetitive sentence stems post-chime. Density overwrites high-pressure wait.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh cryo-library whistleblower angle transforms preservation trope via networks reversal; final snow-truth contrast inevitable from setup. Risk in quiet scandal over confrontation heightens stakes. No template echoes, but repetitive quiet borders familiar atmospheric chill.</comment>
