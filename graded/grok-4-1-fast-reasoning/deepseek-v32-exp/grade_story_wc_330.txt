<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's quietly persistent trait drives restoration choices, culminating in earned vocal break at "Without thought, Elias began to sing," revealing prior silence as cost. Interiority concrete via hands/voice contrast, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal work beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery to labor to song, yielding Charged Poise closure where silence reconfigures into creation with legible cost ("voice rough from disuse"). Orientation anchored early ("abandoned circus train"); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via tactile props (halo fragment, rotting velvet, carousel horses) charging final image; wind bells as micro-setting recur to measure sacred time. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (carpenter notices gleams, splinters); no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as possibility) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening labor to song reversal narrowing voiceless endurance option. Cost visible in rough voice; agency in persistent work/singing forecloses emptiness path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence/possibility via particulars like halo's gleam shifting from whisper to steady light. Final image ("whispering gleam... settled into a steady, gentle light") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing whittles, gleams); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to song intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (scrape of tools to melodic weave); high density, but minor motif paraphrase ("misting hush" recurs without escalation penalty under lens). No loops/artifacts dulling closure; purposeful lyricism propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silent carpenter's song animates circus ghosts, transforming abandonment trope via halo/camel integration. Risky lyric closure heightens stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
