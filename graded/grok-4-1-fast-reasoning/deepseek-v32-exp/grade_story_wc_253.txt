<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moral ambiguity concretely shown via reporting neighbors for melancholy infractions, complicating compliance with Mandate; contradictory impulses act in secret sorrow carvings vs. joy rituals; final endurance earned through embodied whittling choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via narrated whittling/bouquet handling to Charged Poise closure; final image of shadows swallowing farmhouse makes emotional void cost legible; orientation anchored early in farmhouse/turbines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Turbines' sweeping shadows as "bars" and final "swallowing the farmhouse" constrain her shadowed life and charge closure image; selective sensory whirring/scraping integrates with action; micro-setting (table, knife, wood) mirrors internal numbness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating lightness amid grief signaled early but escalation limited to accumulative density without one decisive tightening or option-narrowing under lens; endurance lacks felt trade-off beyond abstract betrayal; no reversal tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed grief/moral ambiguity emerges organically from particulars like crumbling bouquet and whittled shavings; final stillness offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without stated moral; counter-readings in compliance linger purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dramatic narration voice distinct and character-specific, modulating mundane to poetic; stable single POV with perceptual signature in embodied symbolism; elevated diction fits blank-faced performer consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops ("remade hush" x3, "cultivating lightness" x4, "morally ambiguous" x3) and template cadence in repeated "She narrated..." dull propulsion; figurative overload every sentence without pattern payoff obscures closure image; synonym churn (grief/void/heaviness) reduces density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Happiness Mandate dystopia with whittling/narration as futile grief resistance amid turbines; moral grayness of reporting neighbors transforms compliance trope organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
