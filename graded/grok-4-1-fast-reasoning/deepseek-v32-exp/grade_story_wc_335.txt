<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archivist's contradictory impulses—combative tenderness and backward steps under nerves—act in scene, earning Elian's shift and her forward walk at closure; traits like backward walking reveal under pressure without labels. Elian's frustration yields to vulnerability via annotations, with embodied cost in trembling hand. Minor slip in Elian's direct "I've been so angry" borders therapy-speak but ties to prior defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of annotations/shards/leaves tightens to Charged Poise closure where shadow shifts promising change, with conceptual cost of perceptual exile reversal legible in Elian's widened eyes and firm voice. Orientation anchors early (library, shards, Elian by ~100 words). Single scene causality intact, no breaks; micro-turn in swing creaks heightens nerves without redundancy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dusty floor, shard-glass coolness, swing creaks constrain archivist's nerves and choices, charging final calm forward walk; recurring shadow in glass mirrors internal states via action (annotation). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: geometry over visuals. No white-room; playground breeze integrates as pressure cue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mentor reversible exile via resilience) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through leaf/shard comparisons narrowing Elian's self-fight; agency in annotations forecloses anger path with cost in melting defiance. Swing creaks escalate situational nerves coherently. One tightening sufficient, charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience in "crooked lines/shadows" emerges from particulars (tea gates, shadow curves), reweighting exile as perception without moralizing; final shard-light shift offers non-literal answer. Subtext in silences/gestures like backward steps. No tidy binary, ambiguity in "every ending a beginning" lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on archivist with perceptual signature (nerves via swings/backward steps); voice rhythmic, modulates tenderly ("combative tenderness"). Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual: Elian's frustration vs. archivist's silk/steel. No head-hopping; elision of backstory minimal/anchored.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short creak interruptions, flowing annotations); density high, no loops beyond purposeful backward-walk reprise. Minor paraphrase in resilience explanations (−0.3), but no closure touch; metaphors coherent (gates/doors). Propulsion clear, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shard-tea geometry for perceptual exile transforms mentoring trope organically; backward walking as "retreat advance" risks bold, heightens stakes via nerves charging archivist's arc. Irreplaceable particulars like swing-shadow interplay feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
