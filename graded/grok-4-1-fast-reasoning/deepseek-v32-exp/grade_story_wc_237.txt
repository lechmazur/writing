<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to transform scars drives micro-choices like revisiting superstitions, with embodied anxiety in the trembling quill; internal conflict layers stress and hope effectively. Minor slip in overt stating of motivation early, but dramatized sufficiently without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through rune inscriptions and memory revisits to Charged Poise closure in final exhale, releasing crystallized doubts with felt emotional cost on "the last of her crystallized doubts." Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating platform and tea ceremony constrain choices via swaying and wind-offering ritual; sensory hush, steam, pulsing stone selectively mirror internal softening. Recurring stone crystallization charges final glowing runes, filtering through scholar's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake to release scars signaled early, deepens accumulatively as crystallization shifts from hindrance to artistry via superstition revisits, narrowing rigid fear with on-page trade-off cost in softening runes. Protagonist agency in holding breath and speaking aloud forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-stories emerges organically from rune transformations and superstition method, culminating in resonant final image of standing ready with wisdom-beacons; no moralizing, ambiguity in lingering storms invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, perceptual signature scholar-specific (rune precision, memory swirls); rhythm modulates with intensity, purposeful repetition of motifs taught early enhances accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with motifs like "crystallized" and "shed" propelling accumulatively, rhythm varies; minor template cadence in repeated "She [action]" stems and motif synonym churn dull peak softening beats slightly, but no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy rune-ceremony transforms scars via superstitions offers fresh synthesis; motifs like quill and breath constrain uniquely, risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
