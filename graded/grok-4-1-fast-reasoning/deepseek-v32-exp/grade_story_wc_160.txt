<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harmonize values drives concrete micro-choices like scraping adhesive and subtle adjustments during the violent tremble; interiority embodied in shaking hands amid determination. Minor slip in "profound connection" borders unearned epiphany but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (adhesive code, seismic alignment) density-build to RR closure in softer breath and harmonious gates, with felt cost of unnoticed changes. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via violent tremble narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Breathing cycles and ash constrain measurements/tools, mirroring internal states through tremors; surveyor's chain charges final image as "heavier...weighted with history." Recurrent volcano pulse evolves causally, filtering via machinist bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize utility/reverence) signaled early, deepens via code discovery aligning breaths/seismic data; violent tremble forces agency in recalibration with legible cost (resisting touch, shaking hands). Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden kindness balancing divides emerges organically from code's revelation and Elara's echoing adjustments; final image of steady breaths reweights without moral state. Minor echo in repeated "slyly heartfelt" integrates but borders overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with machinist perceptual signature (fibers/patterns in glue, chain links); rhythmic prose modulates tension in trembles. Elevated diction fits ingenious voice without leakage; no dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in ending ("heart light...trembled with quiet joy," repetitive "breathes") dull final image slightly; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors. Varied syntax propels accumulative beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of breathing volcano as character with glue-cipher compassion transforms machinist trope; subtle adjustments risk unnoticed failure, heightening ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
