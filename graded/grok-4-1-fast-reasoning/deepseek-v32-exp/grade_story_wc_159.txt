<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve echoes drives systematic choices, with embodied regret as contradictory impulse peaking in tempered relief at closure. Final endurance of duty with felt cost ("each success was a reminder") is earned. Minor deduction for repeated "foxglove regret" bordering on label-speak without deeper embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to tablet discovery and echo-healing RR closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in final vigil image, foreclosing total loss with ongoing price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal library and spire constrain ascent ("air grew thinner") and supply tablet resource shaping tactics. Glass orchids charge opening/closing image, mirroring transient duty. Sensory details (shimmering codexes, ethereal notes) selectively heighten stakes without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve library/echoes via chime repair) signaled early, tightens via song discovery narrowing options. Agency in search/use forecloses silence path with relief cost felt on page. Escalation coheres accumulatively without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preserving extinct feelings emerges from particulars (codex search, song-weeping), reweighted in final orchid vigil without moralizing. Regret subtext layers choices, inviting ambiguity on humanity's loss. Closing image answers preservation's pyrrhic cost non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual bias toward fragile beauties ("clouds...frozen milk"). Rhythm modulates from systematic calm to ethereal swell at healing. Elevated diction fits fantasy idiom without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images (crack "shimmer...sealed"), but minor paraphrase loops ("forgotten" echoes x4) and repeated "gently systematic" dull select beats. No closure artifacts; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in spire metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct-feelings library fixed by its own echo transforms preservation trope organically. Risky lyric fantasy risks poeticism but heightens closure resonance without gimmick. Irreplaceable premise inflections inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
