<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is concrete and embodied, with regrets as "cerulean waters" tying to micro-choices like tracing lace; Elian applies subtle pressure as tutor. Earned change via diffusion feels motivated by flaws in unspoken words. Minor slip: final nod risks tidy epiphany without peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from teachings to shore walk and cove discovery, with lace-to-locket reprise as Conceptual Repricing reconfiguring regret into spectrum. Orientation anchored early (islet post-rain, Kaelen's severance). Closure cost legible in "gentle ache" diffusion and lighter heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet earth, salt, breeze) selective and purposeful, mirroring tides of memory; islet constrains walk to shores post-rain, charging final "testament to renewal." Bonsai and lace tactile, integrated into action without stalls. Micro-setting (cove fragments) shapes climax discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend severance via apologies' color) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lace study to compass-guided walk narrowing to cove; diffusion spreads ache as felt cost. Agency in following instructions forecloses sharp pain. No reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of diffused regret emerges organically from tides, compass, lace motifs shifting to spectrum forgiveness; locket's swatch offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars like cerulean hue avoid platitudes. Counter-reading lingers in "gentle ache."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (blue regrets, tidal rhythm); voice modulates poetically yet controlled. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual (Elian's measured words advance guidance). No head-hopping; diction biased to Kaelen's remembrance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short steps in walk, breathing prose post-rain); density high, metaphors purposeful (e.g., mist intentions). Minor artifact: echoed "slow/placid" phrasing near start, but no loops dull closure. Propulsion clear to locket image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai tutor, lace-instructions compass pointing to mind-states transforms ghost ship trope; color of apologies as spectrum hue inevitable from cerulean buildup. Risks lyric tone heightening renewal stakes without gimmick.</comment>
