<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in generational duty, with embodied emotions like "brass cool against his fingers" and final "relief and sorrow." Internal conflict limited to nostalgia without simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final endurance earned but lacks hierarchy of values in micro-choices beyond melody shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density increases via pauses, light patterns falter in pattern break. On-page Charged Poise closure—"vested hush prevailed... he would return"—with conceptual cost of endless duty legible in final footsteps silent. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in fog/grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: mist-swirled light, dewdrops on ferns/moss/instrument constrain ritual immersion and charge final image of thinning mist. POV bias via musician's focus on hush amid glow. Recurring mist/grotto subtly guides playing choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as "light patterns began to falter" via agency in "shifted his melody, allowing longer pauses." Cost felt in "chill... weight of his task" and ongoing reprieve, narrowing to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence prevailing over chaos emerges organically from negative space vs. light codes, reweighted in final "profound quiet" without moralizing. Nostalgia motif lingers ambiguously, tying duty to loss. Resonant non-literal answer in dormant atrium.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hush-focused noticing (breathiness, gaps). Prose rhythm modulates with pauses mirroring negative space. No dialogue; voice distinct, poetic without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops—"dewdrops formed" repeats 5x identically, "eerie nostalgia" 3x, hush/silence churn dull momentum across beats. Template cadence in repetitive stems ("He [action]...") violates ear test. Overwriting with unchecked figuration in climax obscures propulsion; scaffold drags closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musician-as-guardian hushing coded light prophecy via negative space feels inevitable. Transforms ritual trope through textural hush mechanics. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens eerie duty without gimmick.</comment>
