<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's traits like patiently strategic drive choices such as ignoring the guard to decode, earning the final planting; embodied actions like tripping with chains reveal contradiction between physical limits and resolve. Guard adds pressure but remains one-note. Repetitive labels like "chained liberator" slightly genericize without deeper flaws complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: wall crash therefore decode arrow on piano keys therefore map and vault access therefore planting with chains loosening as DC/RR closure. Orientation anchored early in prize center under moon. Cost legible in "chains on her ankles loosen" after confrontation, foreclosing past confinement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Piano bench and dusty shelves constrain decoding choice, charging climax; carnival ruins mirror desolation to growth in final sprouts image. Sensory details like "crash echoed" and "clinking chains" integrate purposefully. Spatial choreography clear from center to back room to soil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access seeds) tightens via guard during decoding, narrowing options; agency in chaining trip forces trade-off. Causal escalation coheres to closure planting with felt physical cost. One reversal sufficient, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilience amid decay emerges organically from seeds in ruins to "green shoots spread"; final image reconfigures wall/desolation premise without moralizing. Repetition slightly overtensions resonance. Subtext in chains-to-freedom arc inextricable from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward symbols like arrow/feathers; rhythmic poetic texture modulates tension. No dialogue. Minor convergence in repetitive phrasing but voice coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn in final third ("staggering grace" x4, resilience/rebirth repeats) dull closure image; template cadence in "She [action]" runs. Density pads with redundancies like multiple "wall came down" echoes. Propulsion suffers in summary endings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival vault puzzle into liberation arc; arrow-piano decoding turn earned from early clue. Transforms tropes via seed resilience premise. Risk in symbolic chains pays off without gimmick.</comment>
