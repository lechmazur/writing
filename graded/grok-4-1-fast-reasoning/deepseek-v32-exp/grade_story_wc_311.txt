<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reaper's motivation to name fears drives micro-choices like adjusting prisms, with embodied grief in "heart aching" amid shards of her laugh and shout; internal conflict layers sorrow and acceptance without tidy resolution, earning final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as light density builds shards voicing memories, culminating in Charged Poise closure where crystallized echo pulses her phrase, reconfiguring grief with legible emotional cost in "heart still broken but mending"; orientation anchored in first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's prisms and lenses constrain crystallization action, dusty apparatus grounding choices; atlas page and dusk light charge final image of settled shards as guardians, with sensory hues mirroring internal shift without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of naming fears escalates accumulatively via light-stirred monsters to shard formation and naming, narrowing to acceptance trade-off; agency in focusing apparatus yields felt cost of reliving sacrifice in pivotal shard moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo of sacrifice emerges organically through shards and phrase reprise, reweighting fears from monsters to guardians in final pulse; resonant non-literal answer in crystallized permanence avoids moralizing, with ambiguity in "distant intimacy."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual bias toward echoes and light selective to grief; rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density in light-shard progression propels accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops on "echo" and "fears" (e.g., repeated naming refrains) dull peak density slightly without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper ritualizing grief via prisms and atlas transforms loss trope into tactile crystallization; risk in lyric fantasy pays off in inevitable-feeling reconfiguration of monsters as memory guardians.</comment>
