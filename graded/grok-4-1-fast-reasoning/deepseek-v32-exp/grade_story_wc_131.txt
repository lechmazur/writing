<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in guardian traits, intensified by sense memory during tape playback; embodied tears and calm determination show contradiction between hidden life and desire to help. Micro-choices like gentle probing align with "kindly methodical." Lacks deeper internal conflict or blind spots driving mistakes, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from retrieval to playback to listeners arriving, culminating in Charged Poise closure as Kaelen slips back fulfilled, with cost of perpetual hiddenness legible in final lines. Single scene anchors early; one tightening via flickering lights urging broadcast. Minor redundancy in end summaries slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sapphire hush and flickering lights vividly constrain choices, mirroring internal states and charging final image of dawn breaking. Sensory details (dust, rain scent) filter through Kaelen's crawl-space familiarity. Pipe chases as micro-setting enable retrieval; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share wisdom amid outage) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragile reel handling and lights flickering, forcing broadcast now; agency in methodical threading forecloses delay. Cost felt in unseen guardianship. No reversal, but density reweights isolation vs. impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden visibility through preserved memories emerges organically from tape's voice filling library and listeners' eased worries. Final image reconfigures premise: Kaelen "more visible than ever" despite shadows. Resonant without moralizing; sense memory particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile duct probing and memory scents; voice modulates poetically yet consistently. Rhythmic prose suits accumulative hush. No dialogue; elisions (past caching) anchor to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn in final third ("cache... uncovered... pipe chases," "visible... guardian") dull closure image; "sapphire hush" and "kindly methodical" repeat 5x/3x without pattern payoff, creating template cadence. −1.7 for artifacts touching end; rhythm varies but density dragged by redundancies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl-space guardian preserving analog wisdom amid digital outage; tape fragment as memory beacon transforms hidden trope. Risk in poetic hush tone heightens quiet impact without gimmick.</comment>
