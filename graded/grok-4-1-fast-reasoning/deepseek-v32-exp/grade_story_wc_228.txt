<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between nostalgia and present pull, embodied in trembling fingers tracing shell; change earned via causal path to discovery, foreclosing past-clinging with emotional cost. Minor diagnostic tone in "nostalgia had been a cage" edges below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure at shell discovery and return ("placed the shell back... silent acknowledgment"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of release; orientation anchored early at quay; one tightening via wrong turn suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cave fissures and pool constrain discovery and charge final image as sanctuary; sensory brine/light selective via painterly bias, mirroring internal fragmentation without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clear from thicket to chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (promise confrontation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to shell deepening that narrows nostalgic options; agency in wandering/return forecloses path with legible realization cost; no live antagonist needed for internal pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges organically from shell reprise (early promise to faded return), reweighting nostalgia in CR ending image without moralizing; ambiguity in "fractures can let in light" invites reflection via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with painterly perceptual signature (strokes as "whisper," light "like fleeting dreams"); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density; purposeful compression in cave navigation legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; purposeful "temporary eternity" recurrence pattern-taught without loop; minor paraphrase in nostalgia descriptors ("salt-stung present," "mournful cry") dings slightly but misses closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia trope via self-painted shell in hidden cave, transforming into CR on fleeting peace; wrong turn as gift risks bold internal pivot, inevitable in hindsight without gimmick.</comment>
