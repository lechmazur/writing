<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's reticence creates internal conflict peaking in the daunting preparation to testify, earned through prior sonic work; contradictory impulses act in her slow-then-confident speaking. Minor slip in embodied emotion via repeated "weathered innocence" telling over showing in eyes fixation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tapping crystal to coalescing rhythms, delivering CR closure in "She stood, holding the crystal aloft, ready to speak" with cost of broken reticence legible. Orientation anchored early in library at dawn; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal as recurring object constrains choices (retrieval, tapping) and charges final image ("crystal’s final chime faded"); dawn light evolution mirrors internal shift from shadows to golden renewal. Sensory hierarchy (auditory echoes amid visual gloom) reflects scholarly focus without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode and testify) tightens via sequence coalescence into "rhythm like a heartbeat," narrowing reticence; agency in documentation and standing forces trade-off with felt isolation cost. Escalation accumulative, deepening knowledge under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dormant language growth emerges organically from sonic shards to network realization, resonant in final "fractal sequence" without moralizing; reweights premise via library's tomb-to-womb shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature scholarly-selective (sonic rhythms over bustle memory); rhythmic modulation builds to confident voice amplification, no head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in echo-weaving beats; minor −0.5 for "fractured sequences" paraphrase loops (three uses without new pressure) and "suspended hush" repetition dulling late hush-deepening. No closure touch, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh post-dictionary sonic evolution premise transformed via crystal's prismatic whispers; risk-taking in accumulative linguistic heartbeat inevitability heightens renewal stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
