<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mnemonic gift as curse embodied concretely sharpens internal conflict, enabling the pivotal recall of the combination; micro-choices like tracing the lock and sketching faces reveal values under pressure. Final shift feels earned through purge without tidy epiphany. Minor summary in aftermath dilutes peak embodiment slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds from gallery flight through cave discovery to sketching release, culminating in Charged Poise RR ("felt a shift... seal had been broken... torrent") with legible cost in tears and fragility. Orientation anchored early; single scene with purposeful shards coheres to on-page closure without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal walls as makeshift canvas constrain and enable the climax sketch; prismatic shimmers amplify emotions, charging the final image of rebirth. Sensory selection (cool air, glittering light) reflects POV urgency and mirrors internal auroral sorrow purposefully. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks descent to pillar cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncork creativity) signaled early tightens accumulatively via mnemonic surge and sketching purge, narrowing to bittersweet reconfiguration with felt cost in "auroral sorrow... tears." Agency in lifting painting and drawing faces drives escalation; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragile renewal emerges organically from lock left behind and cave returns, reweighting criticism's pain without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer to inescapable calling via "gentle dawn, always transforming." Subtext in understanding laughers' fears adds complexity. Minor platitude risk in "soul made whole" but anchored in purge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with artist-perceptual signature (charcoal stains, mnemonic clarity); lyrical rhythm modulates from ache to torrent without slippage. Voice texture particular in sensory bias toward light/shadows. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in cave beats propels via varied rhythm; purposeful "auroral sorrow" recurrence charges closure without muddle. Minor overwrite in repeated "echo of laughter" bookend feels patterned but borders template cadence; no loops obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic curse in crystal cave transforms artist-block trope; lock's reinterpretation (not fixed, understood) offers non-obvious turn growing from particulars. Risk in lyric tone heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
