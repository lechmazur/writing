<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve wonder roots actions consistently, intensifying through smeltings to earned endurance at ending. Interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, relying on stated paradoxes via identities. Minor slip in embodied conflict at pivotal whispers ("You are both storm and calm") keeps from higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of repetitive smeltings building to Charged Poise closure. Final image ("The bamboo creel swayed in the breeze") reconfigures eternal routine with conceptual cost of endless cycles legible on page. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective (tidal pools, titan-gears' clicks, receding waters) filters through Elian's serene priorities. Bamboo creel as micro-setting constrains choices (holds fragile identities) and charges final image, mirroring internal harmony. Sensory hierarchy purposeful, evolving causally with tides/moon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve identities/wonder vs lunar shattering) signaled early, accumulates density through smeltings to stance crystallization. One tightening via waning moon softens fluctuations, foreclosing volatility with felt cost ("they would shatter under the moon's pull"). Agency in endurance fits lens without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in contradiction emerges organically from smeltings and images (storm/calm merged). Final image (creel whispering secrets, atrium sleeping) offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting routine without moralizing. Complexity lingers in eternal cycle's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (serene wonder in mundane gears/tides). Rhythmic prose modulates with accumulating poise; purposeful repetition taught early as cycle motif. No dialogue or head-hopping; diction biased to Elian's clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with rhythm varying purposefully around cycle motif; sensory propulsion weaves action/atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "smelting" descriptions ("lifted...placed...whispered" template across identities) dull two beats (−0.4), but closure image clear. No artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of librarian, creel, migrating identities transforms tropes into fresh eternal-present frame. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes of routine's wonder without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
