<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to translate heartbeats into maps roots her deliberate ritual choices, with patience embodied in "did not rush, even as the cold seeped into her bones." Interiority concrete via alchemical priorities, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds patterns to Charged Poise closure at "sealed the final symbol," with cost legible in endured cold and foreclosed haste. Single scene anchors orientation immediately; one tightening via complexifying patterns suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subarctic crater's thin air and cold constrain patience-testing choices, charging final image of transformed orchard. Sensory selection (clawing branches, misting breath) filters through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal potential without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ritual success escalates accumulatively via growing pattern complexity and flash-paper ignitions, narrowing to final seal with physical cost ("cold seeped into her bones"). Agency in micro-gestures forecloses rushed failure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via transformation emerges organically from ritual particulars, resonating in final breeze through trees reweighting stillness. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "path ahead... uncertain" without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in alchemical noticing (sigils, vibrations); rhythmic modulation builds lyric texture under pressure. Purposeful repetition of "moving stillness" taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere without loops; "flash-paper" ignitions propel rhythmically. Minor repetition of "stillness" purposeful for tone, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of flash-paper alchemy and heartbeat maps transforms withered setting into site of empathy; risk in lyric ritual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via patience's payoff.</comment>
