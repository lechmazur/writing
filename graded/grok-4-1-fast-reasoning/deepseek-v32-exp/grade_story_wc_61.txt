<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve light intensifies credibly from anomaly discovery to encoding choice, with embodied unease via cold gear. Interiority concrete via sonar echoes and petal sighs, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—more serene acceptance than crisis-driven conflict. Final renunciation of reignition earned by prior pattern revelation, foreclosing destructive path with garden's fade as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pings mapping anomaly to gear's decline truth, culminating in CR where encoding reconfigures preservation (before: map/decline; after: sonic legacy) with undeniable cost of fading garden. Orientation anchored early in nebula garden transit. One tightening via pattern realization suffices; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nebula garden vividly selective (sonar sketches, petal sighs), constraining choices via core ark and dimming light. Petals as recurring micro-setting mirror internal elegy, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: cosmic timescales and echoes over visuals; no white-room, integrates via transit action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve garden light/memory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via anomaly and decline pattern, narrowing to encode-or-lose. Agency in sonar shift and gear insertion forecloses reignition with visible cost (garden softens, Elara vanishes). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at dissemination; cost legible in fading petals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of finite cycles approximating infinity emerges organically from gear patterns and petal sighs, reweighted by break via encoding without moralizing. Final CR image (pings as perpetual whisper) offers non-literal answer to preservation question, charging prior motifs with legacy cost. Subtext in light-vs-fire tension enriches without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cosmic-sentimental perceptual signature (echoes paint void, beauty approximates infinity). Voice texture distinct in rhythmic prose modulating from unease to peace; purposeful lyric compression taught early via pings pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short pings amid eons), high density integrates image/action without scaffolds. Minor paraphrase loops ("sonar pinged," "falling petals") purposeful as motif, not artifact; no filter stacks or template cadence dulling closure. Propulsion clear, final line recharges echoes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic keeper encoding nebula death via sonar/gear transforms cycle tropes through sonic legacy. Risky lyric structure heightens inevitability of CR, with petal sighs as bold recurring charge. No template echoes; premise commits to infinity's approximation without retreat.</comment>
