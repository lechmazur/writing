<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely in "breath hitched" and "clawed at her," driving micro-choices against duty; motivation to "stand by the unremembered" anchors internal conflict with felt progress. Final endurance of fear yields earned stasis, foreclosing isolation with personal cost. Minor epiphanic summary in closing lines ("phase transitions... of her own spirit") slightly undercuts prior embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from tunnel squeeze to chamber light, tightening to charged poise in ghostly gratitude and escape. Closure as RR legible in "ghostly figures materialized... smiling in gratitude," with cost in imminent tides ("emerged... just as the currents reversed"). Orientation anchored early; single scene causality intact, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phase transitions constrain choices ("stepped through a gaseous barrier"), cables spark as tactile hazard, gold fleck charges paths and hologram—recurrent micro-setting alters tactics. Atmosphere via "crashing hush" mirrors internal tension, evolving to "respectful quiet." Sensory hierarchy (claustrophobic touch/pressure dominant) filters through POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (codex return between tides) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via phase risks narrowing options ("one misstep could trap her"). Protagonist agency in navigation forces trade-offs; cost legible in hurried return amid shifting water. Climax tightens to stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of honoring unremembered emerges organically via duty vs fear, resonant in researcher holograms shifting phases—reweights premise without statement. Final image ("gold fleck’s light now a warm memory") offers non-literal answer on remembrance's healing cost. Minor friction in closing platitude ("some things... deserve to be remembered") borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: claustrophobic narrowing to gold fleck glows and hush. Voice texture modulates rhythmically ("crashing hush deepened, broken only by the hum"), diction biased to explorer's sensory dread. No dialogue; purposeful compression in transitions legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("walls shift, phases transitioning from solid to mist"), but "crashing hush" loops thrice without fresh pressure, paraphrase in end summaries ("unremembered were no longer alone"). Minor template cadence in repetitive gold fleck clauses dulls peak chamber beat. Rhythm varies, no heavy artifacts touching closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: phase-transition facility with illuminant codex tracking energies transforms spelunking trope into metaphysical duty. Gold fleck's evolving guidance feels inevitable; risk in tidal/phase perils heightens without gimmick. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity in ghostly payoff.</comment>
