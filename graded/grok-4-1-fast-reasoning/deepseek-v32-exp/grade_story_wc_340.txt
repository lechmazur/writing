<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to seek joy beneath anguish roots choices like decoding the diary, with embodied anticipation in "heart pattering"; minor slip in label-only "warmly inquisitive nature" without deeper trade-off, but final kinship realization earns change with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as floors build decoding density to CR closure—"she found the joy she sought, glowing softly beneath the surface"—with legible cost in emotional reconfiguration; orientation anchored early in elevator ascent, one tightening at halfway turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice shaft's prismatic patterns and cold metal constrain decoding via light filtration, charging final summit image; sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities, integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through floor-linked revelations narrowing anguish-to-joy arc; agency in persistent decoding forces realization with felt emotional price at "heart swelled."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from diary particulars mirroring Elara's quest, resonant CR in final image reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity in joy's transformation lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in affectionate observations like "gaze, affectionate yet detached"; rhythmic prose modulates effectively, diction purposeful without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in stacked modifiers like "warmly inquisitive anticipation" and "needle of frost and silence" creates minor figurative muddle; repetitive "joy beneath anguish" phrasing loops slightly, dulling peak density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fantasy elevator-decoding premise synthesizes airship relic and ice cipher freshly, with goggles' reprise transforming ascent into emotional parallel; risk in textural progression heightens stakes organically.</comment>
