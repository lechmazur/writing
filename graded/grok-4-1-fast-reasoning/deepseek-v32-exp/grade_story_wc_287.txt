<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's wistfully pragmatic nature shown through embodied ache yielding to acceptance, with micro-choices like rowing and mirroring revealing values hierarchy. Internal conflict surfaces in loss's bone-deep ache versus ritual endurance. Minor label-speak ("wistfully pragmatic") slightly abstracts traits without full contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: petal drop anchors orientation immediately, density builds through rowing ritual to cliff reflection as tightening, closure via bud's Charged Poise reconfigures loss to renewal with prior ache as felt cost. Single scene coherent, no disorientation debt. Lens taught early via hush and rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor and rosebush micro-settings constrain choices (rowing path, bare frame prompts descent) and charge final bud image. Sensory hierarchy (moonlight dips, oar cadence) POV-filtered by gardener's light-seeking bias. Cliff crevices purposefully guide mirroring tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-hope amid loss) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual deepening (oar rhythm to mirror beam), narrowing to personal renewal. Agency in endurance forecloses despair path, cost in bone-ache legible before bud crystallizes poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of light-amplifying renewal emerges organically from petal-to-bud arc and mirror ritual, final tooth-gleam reweights cycle without moralizing. Subtext in tool's unlocking metaphor tensions loss's hush. Particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature biases toward glimmers (petal spiral, moon-sheet). Voice modulates rhythmically with ritual intensity; purposeful poetic compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Patterned lyric repetition ("instill," "hush," "oars") mostly purposeful for textural build but creates paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated purpose/light instilling) dulling mid-density. Rhythmic variety supports meditation beats; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms lock-tool into renewal symbol, fire-escape garden-harbor ritual offers non-obvious light-reflection angle on grief cycles. Risky quiet lyricism heightens renewal stakes without gimmick.</comment>
