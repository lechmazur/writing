<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to honor histories intensifies credibly through vision of Anya's courage, embodied in heart swelling and mental push; micro-choices like tracing brushstrokes reveal values. Interiority concrete via fragment's warmth and resonance. Minor slip in summary phrasing like "between childhood and now" dilutes peak embodiment without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: market density builds to painting irregularities, vision shard tightens via pattern match, CR closure in "story loose, ready to be told" with cost of mist-like slip legible in final descent image. Orientation anchored early (Elara on bridges seeking painting). One meaningful deepening suffices; fragment constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fragment as micro-setting constrains intuition and charges closure pulse; market's ozone/parchment and swaying planks selectively filter through Elara's sensitivity, mirroring blur of times. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (intuition over buzz). Vivid evolution from stalls to cliff back integrates without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfasten Anya's history) signaled early, tightens via brushstroke pattern forcing mental push; agency in leaning/tracing forecloses ignorance with felt cost of elusiveness. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise in lingering instant, narrowing to renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked histories emerges organically via Anya's erased courage contrasting grand tales, resonant in final "story honored and given voice" reweighting anchors without moral state. Particulars like waves/lens fractures shift motif meaning. Invites ambiguity in elusiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in intuition-led noticing (flaring, humming); rhythmic modulation peaks in vision's wind-whipping intimacy. Prose texture poetic yet controlled, diction biased to dream-like tangibility. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive motif phrasing ("between childhood and now," "anchors of intuition") creates minor paraphrase loops across paragraphs (−0.6), but purposeful pattern taught early pays off at closure without obscuring. High density in vision beat; rhythm varies with scene urgency. No filter stacks or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy market and intuitive translation transforms overlooked-history trope via painting unfastening and lens anchors; risk in vision shard heightens stakes coherently. Non-obvious elusively tangible constraint feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
