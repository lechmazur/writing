<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Psychometric reading embodies contradictory terror/awe, earning resolve solidification and final surrender with compass left as cost; sensibly eccentric traits shown in calibrated methods without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as petrichor density and insights build to CR/RR closure: compass spins into water, left as offering, reconfiguring quest with conceptual cost of ineffable embrace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Limestone descent and obsidian lagoon constrain path and charge final ripples/faces image; resonant hush recurs to mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explanations fail) deepens via psychometric clarity from fear to serenity, narrowing to agency in dipping fingers/leaving compass with foreclosed collection cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Petrichor presence vs. vials unused offers resonant answer to collecting transient vs. eternal ineffable; emerges from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory/perceptual signature (scent promise, stone weight) biases noticing; rhythmic hush modulation stable in third-limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dense propulsion through descent; "resonant hush" pattern taught early pays off at closure without loops or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Petrichor collector delving psychometry to hinged lagoon synthesizes fresh mystic quest; compass reprise risks/supports non-obvious repricing.</comment>
