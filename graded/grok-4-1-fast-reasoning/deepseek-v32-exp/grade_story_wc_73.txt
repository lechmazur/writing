<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to capture missed opportunity roots choices like dice rolls and proofs effectively, earning closure acceptance; label-speak ("balancedly daring") and tidy epiphany slightly undermine embodied contradiction in realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via proofs and dice to rupture as pattern break; on-page CR ("texture... resonance in the chaos") lands with conceptual cost of finite acceptance, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase and chipped die as micro-settings constrain calculations and charge final image ("dice rested in her palm"), mirroring internal boundless confinement with purposeful sensory selection (cold stone, humming air).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture texture via perpetual motion proofs) signaled early, escalates via stochastic dice to rupture cadence shift narrowing to acceptance; agency in proofs forces trade-off with felt cost in echoed laughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection's beauty emerges organically from dice/proofs/rupture; final image reweights premise resonantly, but closing line ("opportunities... transformed") verges on explicit thesis, muting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with math/chance perceptual signature; voice texture modulates rhythmically with ascent intensity, diction purposeful despite minor abstract drifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("infinite staircase," "perpetual motion," "missed opportunity") creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs, dulling closure propulsion; overwriting in realization with stacked abstractions adds density drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of infinite ascent, math proofs, and chipped dice transforms confinement trope into chaos acceptance; risk in abstract proofs heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
