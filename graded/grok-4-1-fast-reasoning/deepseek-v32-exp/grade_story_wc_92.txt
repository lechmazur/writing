<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in sparking revolution, rooted in dissident traits, but interiority relies on labels like "calmly inventive nature had foreseen this" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices showing simultaneous impulses. No deep internal conflict dramatized; success feels competent but untested by genuine struggle or blind spots. Final smile earns minor endurance but lacks prior causal buildup of cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout therefore sundial decoding therefore armory intrigue; orientation anchored early in fort/twilight/Elara. Closure as Charged Poise in "small, satisfied smile in the darkness," reconfiguring options with felt secrecy cost (guards confused). One tightening via blackout window narrows path effectively; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminous fort's dying light and blackout constrain choices, enabling stealth; half-painted sundial as micro-setting charges decoding beat and mirrors conspiracy. Sensory details (humming walls, cool metal, shadows on rusted weapons) selective via Elara's priorities, integrated into action. Evolves causally from twilight to persistent dark, pressuring distribution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early, tightens causally via blackout window forcing quick distribution; agency in sundial alignment and panel prying forecloses exposure risk with on-page cost (guards nearby). Escalation coherent under causal lens, one meaningful narrowing sufficient; revolution pamphlets as visible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of subtle rebellion emerges organically from whispers/pamphlets vs. oppression, reweighted in final image of stirring heart under sleeping masters. Subtext in shadows as co-conspirators avoids direct statement; lingering ambiguity on ignition success fits complexity. No moralizing, but resonance relies on repeated motifs without fresh counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (night as ally); voice texture poetic and consistent, modulating hush in stealth beats. No dialogue, so n/a; diction selective (e.g., "winking hush") reflects secretive mind without register drift. Rhythmic control good, but minor compression in repetitive phrasing dulls peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn in ending (e.g., "cradle of sparks" x4+, "calmly inventive" repeats, "silent revolution" variations across final paragraphs) create template cadence and obscure propulsion. Density low from redundancies like sequential "The [element] had [past action]" stems; artifacts pervade final third, dulling closure image. Overwriting with stock phrases ("tide turning," "web woven") violates ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cipher sundial/quill intrigue transforms rebellion trope via fantasy elements, organic to causal chain. Risk in hush tone heightens subtlety; memorable perspective on blackout as gift. Derivative feel from assembled specifics slightly hedges boldness.</comment>
