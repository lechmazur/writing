<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris's sincerely insincere duality drives detached guidance with rare satisfaction flicker at end, earning Elara's shift; her embodied tremble and softened plans show contradictory impulses resolving with cost. Minor diagnostic labels like "insincerity sincere" slightly abstract peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chimes, mirror, cloak build density to Charged Poise closure where Elara sees "spectrum of choices" with fraying certainty cost legible in her shudder and assured grip. Single scene anchors early (lighthouse, dawn by para 1); no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Breezy dawn lighthouse constrains via wind stirring chimes and whipping around cloak drape, charging final sea-watch image; selective sensory (whispers, notes, pale light) mirrors internal softening. Micro-setting (bench, gallery chimes) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. nuance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through shard peer and cloak drape narrowing rigid plans; Elara's agency in accepting/returning shard forecloses binary with felt shudder cost. No live options fully tested beyond one deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nuance-over-certainty emerges organically via cloak/mirror/chimes shifting from conflict to "gradient of experiences"; final waves-watch reconfigures premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity. No moralizing; irony in Aris's hired detachment enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited (Aris-dominant, clean Elara focal shifts); poetic diction/rhythm modulates tension, perceptual bias in chime "deciphering" signature. Dialogue subtextual ("Certainty blinds us") advances; minor filter verbs in actions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overload (cloak/shard/chimes metaphors in most sentences) risks coherence in peak cloak beat; minor paraphrase loops (chimes "speak/decipher" twice, doubt/nuance echoes). Rhythmic variety supports read-aloud propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conscience-mercenary via tangible metaphors (literal cloak unhook, hollow shard gaze-through) transforms doubt trope; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in Elara's spectrum realization.</comment>
