<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through ritual knotting; embodied emotions peak credibly at tears during butterfly brush. Internal acceptance of loss feels earned without despair, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices like weaving and untying reveal values with transience cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reverence builds to Charged Poise CR in wing release after butterfly brush, reconfiguring loss with emotional cost legible in "tears pricking" and "task complete." Single scene anchored early; one tightening via prolonged wait to arrival. No orientation debt; lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Verdant grotto constrains witnessing with isolation and misty breath on skin during weaving; recurring mist and wind charge final drift. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elian's priorities (fragile wing veins); details evolve causally (glow in diffused light). Mirrors internal transience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor migration) signaled early, tightens via wait to butterfly arrival narrowing to poignant brush; agency in untying forecloses with tears cost. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise; visible emotional price alters stance from ache to peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of graceful loss emerges from particulars (wing veins mapping paths, butterfly echo); final drift offers resonant CR reweighting interruption into resilience without moral. Ambiguity lingers in transience beauty; no tidy assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (iridescent fragility, blushing stillness); rhythm modulates from deliberate weave to held breath at arrival. Elevated diction fits esoteric voice; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but paraphrase loops on "transiently rooted" and "blushing stillness" across build-up dull minor beats (-0.4); figurative coherent without muddle. Peak arrival clean; rhythm varies for wait tension. No template cadence or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinction via temporary signals in cloud grotto; transforms trope through esoteric honoring with knot/release risk. Bold lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight butterfly-wing overlap.</comment>
