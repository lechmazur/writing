<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-rooted, compelling choices like interpreting cracks; embodied emotion in "heart pounding with a dare"; final change earned but internal contradiction mild, lacking deeper flaw-driven struggle at climax thrust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore from pavement arrows to vault entry to sphere punch DC; on-page closure cost legible in "healing the cracks in her own soul"; one tightening at dead-end convergence suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded streets and starlit vault constrain navigation choices vividly; sensory selection (pulsing fissures, glittering vapors) mirrors analytical perception; charges threshold moment without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant quest stake signaled early, tightens via maze navigation under causal lens; agency in punch thrust forecloses illusion path with renewal cost; escalation coherent but single deepening limits intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Redemption-through-truth theme emerges from particulars like frozen tears and sphere burst; resonant CR in fading vault reweights premise without moralizing; earned via struggle, avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with pattern-biased perception ("artistic swirls of cracks"); rhythmic prose modulates from steady footsteps to vibrating punch; no head-hopping, perceptual signature distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in finale ("route forever changed... mapped... redemption"); overwriting with stacked modifiers ("swirling vapors that glittered with captured starlight") dulls vault climax propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pavement arrows as map and phantom punch unlocking truths; surreal logic risks pay off in causal quest without gimmickry; transformation of tropes via analytical surrealism.</comment>
