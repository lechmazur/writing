<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through astrophysics lens preprocessing the ruin; earned change to humility at "kindled humility warm her chest" with embodied cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of observations tightening to CR closure; cost legible in final "calm certainty of cycles" reweighting drama as illusion. Orientation anchored early in wreckage; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains observation and charges final dust image; sensory details like "wet earth and shattered dreams" selective via POV bias. Recurring glass sliver guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to strip drama signaled early, escalates accumulatively via daily dust patterns narrowing to humbled stance; agency in patient returns forecloses dramatic view with felt smallness. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges organically from dust evolution, resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer via "one particle at a time."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature blending scientific precision and lyric texture; syntax modulates from analytical to quiet cadence at close. No dialogue; voice coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length; minor synonym churn on "slow" transformation phrasing (e.g., "slow, inexorable shifts" to "slower, grander narrative") dulls one beat slightly. No loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star decay to butterfly dust in greenhouse transforms tropes of loss; risk in lyric observation heightens stakes via irreplaceable anchor image.</comment>
