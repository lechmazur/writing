<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's confident uncertainty drives micro-choices like revising logs and composing the signal, with embodied tremble in hands at the priority transmission revealing internal conflict. Interiority particular via cosmic metaphors tied to her profession. Minor slip in abstract "therapy-speak" summaries of traits, but pivotal choice at climax feels earned without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: data network builds density toward anomaly's pulse mirroring her "wrong seeds," culminating in CR closure where stabilization reconfigures failure into connection with conceptual cost of endless reinterpretation. Orientation anchored early (Outpost in anomaly post-mistake). One tightening via priority transmission narrows to dialogue; final image ("she had threshed a profound meaning") makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring pen constrains choices (tracing air, clasped at end) and charges final image, while anomaly setting evolves causally (swells to hum) mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy via warped light/time filtered through interpreter's priorities. Micro-setting (console, pen) integrates purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh meaning from failure) signaled early; network data deepens to anomaly's response, forcing synthesis signal with agency in calibration proposal. Under accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights to Charged Poise. Cost legible in "hopeful correction" amid uncertainty, charging final peace image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reinterpretation emerges organically from particulars (logs, signal dialogue, seeds-to-connection), with final image offering non-literal resonant answer to failure's premise. Subtext in pen's "new kind of writing" recharges motifs without moralizing. Complex ambiguity lingers in "endless, uncertain... process."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in cosmic idiom ("light bent in impossible curves," "time felt thin"); diction/rhythm modulates from churning anomaly to quieting hum. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful and legible under lens. Elevated register fits interpreter's voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "dried-up pen... reminder of a time when marks were made with intention" advances character/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors early ("swell and churn," "crooked story"), but purposeful and non-muddled at closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi signal dialogue with heirloom pen as conduit transforms failure trope into relational cosmic connection. Risk in abstract "confidently uncertain" frame pays off via anomaly stabilization. Non-obvious angle on editing history as mutual calibration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
