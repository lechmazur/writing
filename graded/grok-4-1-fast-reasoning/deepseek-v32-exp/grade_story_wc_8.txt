<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in fierce clarity drives deciphering the "veritas" clue; embodied emotion in "cold and sharp" anger channels into research without therapy-speak. Interiority particular via life parallel, revealing sacrifice empathy. Minor label reliance on "emotional rationality" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening parallels and discoveries building density to CR closure: "veritas" reprices letter as innocence plea with conceptual cost of historical sacrifice legible in final peace. Orientation anchored early in station. One tightening at marginal word suffices; cost felt in rosebush's "painful but necessary" thorns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rosebush anchors timeframe and charges final image, constraining start ("after the final petal dropped") and reconfiguring truth's pain. Ivy rustles urging action, mirroring internal secrets; damp earth/old roses sensory bias fits historian's cataloging. Details evolve tactilely without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early tightens accumulatively at "veritas" discovery, narrowing to proof with agency in deciphering/photographing. Cost legible in sacrificed honor parallel and personal silence memory altering empathy. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically via scribe/modern parallels and letter ambiguity, reweighted non-literally in "truth deserved its freedom." Final rosebush image resonates with painful integrity sans moralizing. Subtext in hidden "veritas" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with historian's perceptual signature in decay cataloging and Latin ambiguity spotting. Prose texture modulates from clinical to thrilled at clue ("hands steady despite the thrill"). No dialogue; rhythmic control under realization peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density weaves setting into action; rhythm varies with scene breath. Paraphrase loops in "noble lie"/parallels phrasing (e.g., repeated "drawing parallels") dulls mid-section momentum without touching closure. No major artifacts in peak "veritas" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medieval letter as coded innocence via modern scandal parallels transforms trope. Station/rosebush frame offers non-obvious historian sanctuary; risk in reflective mode heightens quiet CR without gimmick.</comment>
