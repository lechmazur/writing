<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's ironic flaw as closure seeker drives the internal arc, with embodied pain (stitches protest) and micro-choice to lean forward revealing values; final acceptance of telepathy as tunnel forecloses prior wound-probing path with emotional cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density (scar → coffee ring → fern → acorn tunnel → realization); CR closure lands at "scars are tunnels" (line 356) with conceptual cost of reweighting her life's pursuit, oriented early (tower post-surgery by para 1).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower micro-setting (frosted windowsill drip, oak table) and recurring objects (bandage constrains probing, fern enables telepathy) charge final palm-over-bandage image; sensory hierarchy (throb, metallic taste) reflects post-anesthesia haze narrowing to clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher scar's story) deepens accumulatively via fern's root-tunnel guidance narrowing options from excavation to witness; agency in receptive listening forces stance shift, with felt cost in tear (line 204) charging olive tree affirmation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reverent witnessing over forceful excavation emerges organically from particulars (acorn's blind tunneling, coffee ring's circle); final hourglass melt reconfigures scar motif without statement, satisfying 9+ test with lingering ambiguity on "displaced miracles."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (fractal lacework, verdant wave); rhythmic modulation from foggy haze to crystalline clarity mirrors emotional arc, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., coffee ring maps memory/loss), varied rhythm passes ear test; deduct for figurative overload in peak insight beat (fern to acorn, lines 122-194) with mixed vehicles (glacial sand, blind faith shoot) risking coherence under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-reading obsession, plant telepathy, and acorn tunnel miracle transforms introspection trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative design heightens quiet stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early fern cue.</comment>
