<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via analytic observation of grief as physics, embodied in "stone in his chest"; contradictory impulses (dispassionate data vs. personal echo in transmission) act in closure beat, earning shift without diagnostic slips touching pivotal release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably from silt-drift entry to snow globe settling; on-page Charged Poise closure reconfigures letting-go premise with felt emotional cost in "stone... shift—not vanish, but settle"; orientation anchored by word 30, one tightening via tape-to-grief parallel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library micro-setting constrains via corrosion/anemones, charges final image; snow globe as recurring tool/object embodies tactile evolution ("clouded yet unbroken," "particles settling"); sensory hierarchy (silt, rebreather breaths, rust) filters through diver's bias without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through globe shake/tape/transmission; agency in untangling forecloses clinging path with on-page cost ("stone... shift"); coherent pressure to closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (globe turbulence-to-stasis, frayed transmission); final image non-literally reweights surrender without moralizing—"glitter... transformed... honoring the journey"; resonant ambiguity in grief-as-wisdom lingers via counter-readings of analytic ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with analytic perceptual signature ("viscosity, terminal velocity"); rhythmic modulation heightens melancholy ("each breath... measured counterpoint"); purposeful compression in reflective shards taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via physics diction, but minor synonym loop in settling ("surrendered to order," "dissipate... settle," "soft finality") dulls final third slightly; rhythm varies purposefully, no scaffold obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diver's analytic grief-model via snow globe physics transforms sunken-treasure trope; risk in metaphorical equivalence (tape/globe/soul) heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from early "vectors of surrender."</comment>
