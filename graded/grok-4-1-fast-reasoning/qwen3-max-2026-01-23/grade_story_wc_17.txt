<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's obsession drives discoveries to an earned shift from curiosity to covenant, with embodied tears and heavier heart revealing contradictory joy/grief. Interiority concrete via vibrations and echoes. Minor label-speak ("sensitively perceptive") slightly genericizes traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vibrations to negative glimpse and CR closure ("Legacy was not a weight to crush..."), reweighting premise with emotional cost in final image. Single scene, orientation anchored early. Minor redundancy in realization beats doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and stone fireplace constrain actions (brushing decay, sunlit patch for viewing); vibrations felt in mortar charge perceptual signature. Sensory details (rustle, ash) selective and purposeful. Post-climate specifics vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (walls' dreams) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via diaries/negative to reweight legacy with felt cost (heavier heart, solemn duty). Glimpse forces stance crystallization. One tightening sufficient; agency in handling artifacts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Legacy's burden emerges organically from burning diaries vs. preserved negative, resolving in resonant CR ("thread connecting past joy to future remembrance") without moralizing. Complexity in joy/grief balance lingers. Final image recharges prior joy glimpse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (echoes, vibrations bias noticing); poetic diction/rhythm consistent and modulates to charged poise at end. No head-hopping. Minor register elevation in epiphanies borders ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "legacy's burden" (4x verbatim-ish) and "dreams" dull ending closure image; template cadence in repetitive "She [action/emotion]" runs across revelation beats. Density high otherwise, rhythm varies. Figuratives consistent ivy/stone motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-climate "corridor echo cartographer" mapping walls' dreams via negative transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in CR without gimmickry. No close echoes of templates.</comment>
