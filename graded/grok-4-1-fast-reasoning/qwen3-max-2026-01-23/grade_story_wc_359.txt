<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to certify wonder intensifies through embodied synesthetic choices and weary triumph; tears freezing on cheeks reveal joy under physical cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, yielding smooth harmony over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via escalating resonance density from strikes to reborn silence; Conceptual Repricing closure lands cleanly in "The returning silence was reborn: warm, humming with latent joy," with weary body as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora fissure constrain choices by guiding synesthetic interpretation and enabling resonance; final "ice humming a permanent testament" charges closure image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through layered unfettering, narrowing to spirit-soaring proof despite bodily weariness; cost legible in "body weary but spirit soaring."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's necessity emerges organically from particulars like photon journeys and ice chorus; resonant final image reweights hush-to-song without moralizing, though "proven awe’s necessity beyond doubt" borders explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("emerald ribbons as ascending scales") persists stably, with rhythmic modulation from repose to climax; no head-hopping, elision purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Figurative density overwhelms peak strikes ("shard of crystalline cerulean blue... prismatic sparks"), mixing vehicles and dulling propulsion slightly; rhythm varies but synonym churn on "light/resonance" loops mildly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthesia-fused aurora-bell ritual transforms wonder trope into inevitable, risky lyric synthesis; "final note was silent white—a convergence of all colors" feels fresh and hindsight-charged.</comment>
