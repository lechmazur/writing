<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's perceptively calm presence enables absorbing history and guiding Kai without flinching, earning his realization; contradictory impulses subtle in tracing markers while sharing trophies. Kai applies pressure as idealist seeking wisdom, forcing micro-choice to dissuade. Final renunciation of money shows earned change with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via markers/money/dialogue to CR closure—leaving inheritance reconfigures territory as inner peace, cost legible in "final offering to the cycle." Orientation anchored early (circus train at dusk). Single scene, one tightening through Kai's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Train constrains via territorial markers dictating lesson; dust, groan, amber light sensory and purposeful, mirroring internal states (e.g., "dust motes dancing like forgotten memories"). Dusk evolves to "forgiving dusk," charging final image. POV bias filters circus fossils through Leo's calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths circle) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Kai's venture pressure and markers' history paralleling robber/startup falls. Leo's agency in dissuading forecloses domination path. Cost felt in leaving money, charging poise forward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (hunger vs. service) emerges organically from parallels (robbery/circus/startup), resonant CR in final image reweighting territory without moralizing. Money shifts from trophy to offering. Ambiguity lingers in "conscious journey forward."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (calm cataloging strata); voice rhythmic, diction polished (e.g., "crystalline clarity"). Dialogue natural/subtextual—Kai stammers idealism, Leo indirection via walls/markers advances theme. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy dialogue amid lyric opens); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative (e.g., "rusted spine," "historical strata") coherent. Propulsion peaks in dialogue, breathes in silence. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: robber's trophies parallel VC "ambush," circus train strata recharge startup fall. Risky reflective mode pays off in CR without gimmick. Irreplaceable particulars (SV carving, user map ghost) transform trope.</comment>
