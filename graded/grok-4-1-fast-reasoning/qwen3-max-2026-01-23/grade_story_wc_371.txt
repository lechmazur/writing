<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's embodied tear into soil captures contradictory sorrow/hope, compelling the bread-sharing choice with visible emotional cost; motivation roots consistently in noticing erosion, driving guerrilla planting as renunciation of despair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds from ivy-cloaked arrival to bread reprise; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with pocket crust's transformation (235), legible cost in tear baptism (169).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard constrains planting on eastern wall and charges final bloom image; ivy, moss, soil filter through Elara's noticer bias, mirroring internal reclamation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred amid loss) signaled early tightens via tear-deepened memory flood during planting, forcing resilience stance; agency in seed placement and bread-breaking forecloses grief path under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sacred-in-ordinary emerges organically from soil uncloaking and bread steam, resonating in final "absolution blooms" image that reweights loss without moralizing; ambiguity in tenuous peace lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with noticer perceptual signature ("fading scent of yeast") stable in single POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, modulating rhythm with scene intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in "tenuous absolution/resilience" cluster near closure dull charge; rhythmic variety strong overall, but repetitive "quiet/gentle" stems create minor template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening as absolution ritual transforms grief tropes; courtyard bread miracle risks bold reclamation angle, inevitable in hindsight via noticer arc.</comment>
