<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via meteorological lens (e.g., "barometric notation and cloud classification"); contradictory impulses act in rejecting panic for lateral progress; final endurance earned with cost in disguised message risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anomaly discovery to crimson clay realization to charged release; on-page Charged Poise closure ("resolve firm as the courtyard stones") reconfigures threat with felt risk cost; orientation anchored early at gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (jasmine whisper, flagstone kiss) filtered through storm recorder bias; courtyard micro-setting constrains logging/release choices and charges final starlit image; recurring olive tree/sundial anchor without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant integrity stake signaled early, tightens accumulatively via clay probe → lateral disguise tactic narrowing flight/confrontation options; agency in endurance/release bears visible risk cost to trusted contact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of persistent integrity emerges organically from lateral response and final anchoring image; resonant non-literal answer in smile/horizon gaze reweights fear without moralizing; particulars like clay vial avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (sky's subtle language, atmospheric scars); rhythmic texture modulates tension to poise; no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (e.g., "frayed edges of her vigilance," "fortified calm") during peak intuition slightly dulls; no loops or artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-spying on quarantine via pigeon hack-back; lateral progress turn grows inevitably from recorder traits; risk in quiet defiance transforms surveillance trope organically.</comment>
