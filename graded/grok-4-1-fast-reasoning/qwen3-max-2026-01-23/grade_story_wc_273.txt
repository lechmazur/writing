<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion via "serene anger simmered: a calm, focused heat"; motivation roots choices like drone activation and final renunciation, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ink patterns echo eclipse dust, tightening to drone's disappearance and CR closure ("He would not rebuild the drone"); cost legible in loss and release, with patterns as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind-carved stones and encampment constrain drone path and charge final image ("wind sighed... erasing all evidence"); sensory details (warmth-held tunnels, polished stone) filter through tracker's bias, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (eclipse mystery) escalates accumulatively via ink mirroring patterns, forcing realization with drone loss as visible cost; agency in activation narrows options to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual anchors emerges organically from dust/ink patterns to CR ("time does not slow physically... heightened mind perceives"); final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing ("swirling, ephemeral patterns echoing the eclipse’s celestial dance"); rhythmic modulation under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel (e.g., ink spill beat layers senses/action); minor paraphrase loop in "serene anger" repeats (3x) slightly dulls without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh perceptual twist on time dilation via ink patterns and drone; transforms tropes organically, with risk in quiet CR closure heightening stakes.</comment>
