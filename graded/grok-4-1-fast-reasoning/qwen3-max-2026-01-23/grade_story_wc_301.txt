<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in cradling the accordion amid regret, with the final play of middle C earning change through prior neglect emblem; no unearned epiphanies, as solace arises from concrete action. Interiority particular via river-trained perceptions. Flaw of silence/neglect complicates and resolves organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from map/accordion entry to graffiti CR, with closure in leaving the map (felt cost: forsaking charted path). Orientation anchored by ~50 words at gates. No shards/transitions needed; single scene tightens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accordion constrains choice (play despite tape) and charges final image slung over shoulder; ivy/restroom graffiti guide to revelation, sensory hierarchy river-specific (textures/gradients). Details evolve (dust tear path) mirroring internal erosion. Micro-setting (patched bellows) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness path) signaled early, deepens via graffiti to note-play renunciation of map; agency in methodical inhale/press forecloses paper reliance with emotional cost (release tear). Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>River motif emerges organically, reweighted from external survey to internal flow in graffiti/note; final image (accordion hip-rest, river glint) non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity in neglect's permanence embraced. Earned from particulars, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (riverbed eyes on graffiti, emotional sediment); rhythmic modulation builds to breathy note vibration. Lyrical compression taught early (ivy whisper, dappled light), legible at closure. No POV issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "pulled the bellows apart; the patched tape held firm"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dulling closure. Minor figurative density in entry but purposeful; metaphors coherent (river smooths stone).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chronicler pilgrimage, graffiti oracle, taped accordion as flawed instrument; transforms healing trope via river erosion logic. Risky quiet CR inevitable from setup; no derivatives.</comment>
