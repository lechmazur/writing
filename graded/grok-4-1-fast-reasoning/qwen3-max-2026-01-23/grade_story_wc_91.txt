<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand transformation drives the release with embodied bittersweet joy and micro-choice of uncorking jars. Interiority concrete via sand-sifting and tears; backstory anchored without flattening pressure. Minor slip: reflective backstory summaries slightly exceed BRR efficiency, but tilts present release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory buildup (sand, rumbles, alignment) to bug release as CR, reweighting transformation with cost of sole possession lost. Orientation anchored early (coastal road to beach). Closure cost legible in "lightness of release" and empty jars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Black sand, volcano rumble, celestial alignment constrain release timing and charge final hush image. Sensory hierarchy (warm grit, bug flicker) mirrors internal unspooling. Evolving details (rumble softens) integrate purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grasp transformation's texture) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via alignment "knowing" and release narrowing to selfless act. Cost felt in "heart swelling with bittersweet joy" and possession forfeiture. Coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of accidental grace via release emerges organically from bug swirl calming volcano, reweighting coincidences without moralizing. Final image (hush in soul, celestial witness) answers transformation non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in textured noticing (grain as "violent creation cooled"). Voice modulates rhythmically to hush cadence. Brief Mano glimpse at closure reads as witness, not hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to release; hush motif patterned, not looped. Minor artifact: "whispering hush"/"vibrant hush" repetitions verge on paraphrase in reflective beats, slightly dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bugs as "summer light" accidentally fulfill prophecy, transforming release into miracle. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable inflection in volcano hush from Elara's unawareness.</comment>
