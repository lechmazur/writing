<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied perfectly in the daily knife-sheathing ritual, earning the endurance of her pacifist path with felt cost; interiority concrete and particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in the final sheathing vow; cost legible in "conscious burial of violence"; orientation anchored early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sandbag scrap as micro-setting constrains choices (ties stem) and charges final image; dome/ roses purposefully filter perception, mirroring internal resolve without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming violence to nurture) signaled early, escalates via ritual deepening under accumulative lens; one tightening in stem-tying forecloses violent path with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-chaos emerges organically from particulars like scrap-to-stem; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("engraved quiet," petal chime) biases noticing toward resilience; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation suiting tranquil intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but minor paraphrase loops ("tranquil blaze" defined redundantly; "weave continuity" twice) dull momentum slightly; no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifist gardening as violence transformation, with knife/scrap as bold, irreplaceable risks heightening stakes organically.</comment>
