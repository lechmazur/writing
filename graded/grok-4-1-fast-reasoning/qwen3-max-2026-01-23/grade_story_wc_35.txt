<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under contagion pressure, as in "phantom grief tightened his throat, tears welled," reveal hierarchy of values; earned endurance via kitchen discipline anchors change. Minor abstraction in "emotional cartography" slightly distances interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure at "coral warmed... tasting of peace," cost legible in "trembling with exhaustion yet cleansed." Orientation anchored early in courtyard puddles; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal pools and coral pavilion constrain choices (pool directs digging, ice demands touch) and charge final image ("single melted drop... final tear of release"). Sensory details purposefully filtered through chef's notice, evolving with absorption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of subsuming remorse signaled early, tightens via absorptive deepening under Accumulative lens, forcing trade-off in contagion risk; agency in mental refining narrows options with embodied cost peaking at "weight settled deep in his bones."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of refining pain emerges organically from particulars, resonant non-literal answer in final image reweighting "polish[ing] its sharpest shard" motif without moralizing; complexity lingers in internalized "quiet strength, sturdy enough... brittle enough."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct chef perceptual signature in cooking metaphors ("slow-rising dough, perfect consommé") modulates rhythm under stress; stable close third-person limited with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via chef-inflected syntax; minor figurative density in climax absorption ("sandpaper... cooked the remorse—adding...") borders coherence slip but stays voice-motivated without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-tasting chef and paradoxical coral-ice pavilion transforms tropes into inevitable alchemical arc; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens emotional stakes, fresh in "sandpaper rough memories" motif.</comment>
