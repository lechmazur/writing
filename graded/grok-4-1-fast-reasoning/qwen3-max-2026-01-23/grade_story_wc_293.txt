<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong arc from haunted loss to renewed creation via fiddle-playing choice; embodied awe in "wave of luminous disbelief washed over him"; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, tilting to declarative epiphany over conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from observation to resonant reconfiguration in final playing ("melody weaving scaffold’s rhythmic flutters with ghost of lost bridge"); closure Charged Poise with cost of abandoning elegies legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap flutters as recurring micro-setting constrain revelation and charge final image of transformation; sensory details (ozone, dust motes) selectively bias through observant POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming song escalates texturally from recounting to glowing flake to bow-drawn note; agency in placing flake on strings forecloses mourning with felt cost in "honoring fragments, not the whole."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented grace emerges organically from glass cracks and flutters; final image reweights "never" into blueprint without moralizing, though direct "true creation embraces" line slightly overtells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature in "dynamically observant" cataloging; rhythmic prose modulates from observation to swelling music without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene swell, high density in image integration; paraphrase loops in ending realizations ("sculpt possibility from ashes of 'never'" repeats twice, fragments thrice) dull peak momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vanishing hitchhiker, cracked glass flake, and fluttering scaffolds into pixelated rebirth; scaffold "secret mapped" turn feels inevitable from observant traits.</comment>
