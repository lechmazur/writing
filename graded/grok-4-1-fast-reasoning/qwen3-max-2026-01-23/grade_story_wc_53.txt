<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's resolute scavenging and embodied regret propel micro-choices like turning the wheel; internal contradiction peaks in tears and apology to ghost. Minor therapy-speak in "erosion is part of the art" tidies resolution without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as fragment density builds to integration at "Translucent fingers brushed her hand," delivering on-page RR with legible cost of dissolved separation. Orientation anchored early in lagoon and halt; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon's swirling currents and emotion islands constrain Elara's path across iridescent surface and charge closure exhale. Sensory details like "clouds pooled like liquid mercury" mirror fractured internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of negotiation escalates accumulatively via fragment amplification, tightening at sculptor's story to force merger with cost in "decades of separation dissolved." Agency in offering wheel forecloses isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions theme emerges via concrete fragments, reweighted non-literally in final "I am enough" image answering compromise vs. failure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in chronologically confused weaving of timelines; lyrical rhythm modulates from stillness to swirl without leakage. Sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "joy like amber" builds texture without muddle; minor "eroded" refrain echoes taught early. No loops dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of camera wheel unlocking ambitions in cloud carousel transforms regret trope; bold integration payoff feels inevitable from lagoon logic.</comment>
