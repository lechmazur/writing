<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between repair and vivification act in scene via blood catalyst and surrender; final vivification earned by failures with embodied cost in frozen tears. Stoically sensitive trait shown concretely in perceiving metal's "song" others miss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: failure density builds to pattern break ("creative destruction") and RR closure in staff's pulse with legible cost ("tears of joy froze"). Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains via embers for metamorphosis and mirrors staff's frozen bloom in frost fractals; recurring snowdrop charges final apex. Sensory details (cold cinders, frosting lashes) filter through alchemist priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify to escape destiny) signaled early; escalation via deepening insight ("the break was...fertile void") driven by agency under Accumulative lens, foreclosing repair path with felt cost in surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth from destruction emerges via particulars (fracture to vines); final image of staff's glow reconfigures brokenness as "infinite beginnings" without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to stifling destiny.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in alchemical metaphors ("liquid moonlight"); rhythmic control modulates from desperation to calm at "whispered, 'Show me your true shape'". No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Slight figurative density in peak ("frost crystallized in fractal patterns") risks minor muddle but supports textural lens without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy tropes via "frozen bloom" and vivification from bishop's symbol; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in charged closure without gimmickry. Transformation of rigid crozier feels inevitable.</comment>
