<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied (tremor in spirit, tear tracing dust), with micro-choices under pressure (aligning crank to antinode) revealing values. Motivation intensifies consistently to compel discovery, earning the final reconfiguration from burden to purpose. Minor tidiness in epiphany feels slightly rationalized rather than fully contradictory in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from musing to visualization to dust discovery, culminating in on-page CR (letter reweights dynasty as purposeful) with legible emotional cost (tear, weight lifted). Orientation anchored early (Elara in sepia room, evening). One tightening via intuition focus to wall suffices; persistent constraint of silence/bridge shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust bands as fossilized echo constrain choice (guide handle alignment), charging final image (hand over horn sees potential). Sensory details selective/POV-filtered (scent of paper/beeswax, golden shadows mirroring internal shift). Micro-setting (western wall, vellum volume) integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening intuition (visualize waves → dust → panel), narrowing to CR with agency in method. Cost felt in spirit tremor/release, foreclosing burdened path. Visible price alters stance without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy as release emerges organically from particulars (dust waves, letter's "purpose"), reweighting premise in final image (crank as compass, dynasty cradle). Resonant non-literal answer via reconfiguration avoids moralizing. Earned irony in "ender" as liberator lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (soul-seeing, resonant architecture). Lyrical texture modulates rhythmically (long shadows to charged poise). Purposeful compression in visualization taught early, legible at closure; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task (e.g., "dust had settled not randomly, but in precise... bands" advances plot/atmosphere). Rhythm varies read-aloud; figurative pattern (waves/shadows) coherent without muddle in discovery beat. Minor overwriting in openings, but no loops or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: standing waves as literal/intuitive bridge transforms hidden-message trope via physics (nodes/antinodes dust). Risky lyricism heightens stakes of internalized discovery. Fresh angle on legacy feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
