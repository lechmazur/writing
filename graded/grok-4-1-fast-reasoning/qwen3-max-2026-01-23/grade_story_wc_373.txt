<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dual vow to protect truce while documenting fragility creates contradictory impulses enacted in interventions; final declaration earned by causal buildup of evidence against Silas (204-230). Father's absence embodied as hollow chest and felt presence adds particularity without summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via false starts (105-133) linking to Silas's snap (164) and shatter (176); on-page RR closure in truce repair (243) with shamed silence as legible cost. Single scene oriented immediately; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pier's splintered bones and slick planks constrain movement in crowded aisles; sensory selection (salt, whispers, lap of water) mirrors urgency. Sunrise gilds cracks (275), charging final image with environment-shaped endurance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect/document truce signaled early, escalates causally through three false starts tightening coil (143); agency peaks in exposure narrowing Silas's options with ink/dye evidence cost (212-230).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust's fracture/mend emerges via captured gasp (188) reweighted in resilient repair sounds (260); final image (293) offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual bias (whiskey-scented air as father); dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Silas lies," 204). Rhythm modulates tension without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied syntax; purposeful "comforting unease" motif avoids loops. Minor figurative density coherent, no muddle in climax (230); ignores generator word counts as non-textual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sonic capture of trust via wax cylinder in moonshine pirate market transforms tropes organically; false starts and ink-cuff reveal offer fresh causal ingenuity tied to closure.</comment>
