<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in trauma decryption, with micro-choices like tracing glyphs revealing values under pressure; past camp boy memory earns change without tidy epiphany. Minor diagnostic slips like "shrewdly innocent gaze" slightly abstract emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from observation to decryption-whisper closure (Charged Poise RR); "Will the dark stay forever?" triggers tightening memory link with felt emotional cost reshaping past knots. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brain coral constrains tactile focus and charges final placement image; twilight mist mirrors anxiety reconfiguration without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy (tactile glyphs, watercolor haze) reflects translator POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (grafting wounds via decryption) signaled early, tightens via memory-deepening under accumulative lens, forcing vulnerable whisper agency; cost legible in softened "rigid knots of her past." One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-to-strength emerges organically from cast glyphs paralleling camp boy, reweighted in final coral placement without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "rope braided...for connection."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (codes in chaos); rhythmic modulation peaks in decryption beats, diction controlled and voice-specific without filter stacks or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; figurative layering ("watercolor haze of indigo and pearl") coherent but dense in opening risks slight overwrite (-0.3). No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator decoding kid's cast as trauma bridge transforms hospital vigil trope; coral-graft conceit feels inevitable from Pacific roots, risking bold lyricism without gimmickry.</comment>
