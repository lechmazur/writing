<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in 30-year quest compels songs under timing pressure; embodied emotions peak in tears tracing dust on cheeks; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-stakes singing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of songs builds to alignment's RR closure; golden tapestry completion and grape miracle reconfigure grove with felt cost of Elara's lifelong effort; orientation anchored early in arbor/dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Verdant arbor's dew, moss, and alignment constrain ritual choices; sensory details evolve causally from hush to hum, charging final restored image; body (kneeling, aching joints) mirrors stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoration tightens via precise alignment under Accumulative lens; songs' activation forecloses failure with visible cost in vine's glow-to-tapestry arc; agency in singing narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory's renewal emerges from golden stories' vivid village scenes; final arbor echoes offer non-literal resonant answer without moralizing; subtext in woven traditions lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with whimsical perceptual signature (gears, stones in pockets); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to swelling voice; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical density purposeful with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language (liquid gold unspooling) coherent in ritual beat; minor overwriting in opening descriptions but propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer ritual with vine-spun stories transforms fantasy tropes; golden narratives as healing agent inevitable from vine activation; risks lyric mode heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
