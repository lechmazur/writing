<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in marrow/time unwinding and joint reversal; contradictory impulses to share vs. withhold grief act in the trance decision to guard Elara's memory. Final endurance of withholding earned by ripple revelations with felt emotional cost. No label-speak flattens peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ripple density building to spiral CR; orientation anchored in first paragraph (grotto, Aris, night). Closure cost legible in "guarded for twenty reverse-lived years" and pond's unification. One tightening via interfering rings suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto/pond constrains trance and ring observation; floating platform enables settling/casting with tactile hum. Starlight ripples and sycamore mirror internal reversal selectively. Body as micro-setting (reversing bones) charges final rise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (master patterns for teaching) signaled early, deepens via ring interactions to spiral repricing narrowing grasp impulse. Agency in stone-throw/focus forecloses frantic revelation with grief cost felt on-page. Textural escalation reweights options undeniably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing-as-translation emerges via rings/spiral mirroring sycamore, reweighting loss into resilience without statement. Final image answers withholding question resonantly via crystallized purpose. No moralizing; ambiguity in pain lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited perceptual signature biases to temporal layers/ripples; diction/rhythm modulates from sync'd breath to deepened starlight. Lyrical compression taught early via magnetic hum, legible at closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., splash punctuates silence, expands rings); rhythm varies for trance propulsion. Purposeful ring repetition accumulates without loops; no artifacts dull spiral image. Zero paraphrase in peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reverse aging synthesized freshly via ripple temporal layers, transforming loss trope into pattern-language with risk-taking CR. Premise implications (withheld grief) followed fully; sycamore/seed spiral inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
