<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to illuminate assumptions drives consistent probing, with Elara's flicker and palette reveal earning her change via prior rhetorical pressure. Contradictory impulses show in Elara's trembling vs. emerging spark. Minor embodiment slips (e.g., "choked sob" generic) prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of loops/questions builds to RR closure in palette opening and crimson squeeze, with cost in tear/sob making before/after legible. Orientation anchored early in chapel/anchor. Persistent constraint of narrowing time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chapel as "solidified silence" and flickering window constrain choices, charging final hum of restoration. Sensory hierarchy (bones vibrate, chill recedes) reflects Kael's perceptual bias. Recurring silence-as-canvas mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt possession/anchor unravel) signaled early, tightens texturally via groaning anchor and "narrowing corridor," forcing rhetorical escalation. Agency in Kael's questions narrows Elara's isolation; cost felt in "liquid light" tear. Closure convergence clean under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of spectrum wholeness vs. reduction emerges via cobalt-to-crimson arc, resonant in final blend as non-literal answer reweighting prior vacuum assumption. Subtext in silences/gestures invites ambiguity without confusion. No moralizing; irony in hidden colors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in silence-decoration motif; rhythmic modulation with loops under pressure. Stable third-close POV on Kael, minor slippage to Elara's eyes unintrusive. Dialogue sparse but subtext-rich, naturalistic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overwriting via figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "cold vine coiling," "frayed edges knitting") muddles clarity without full pattern payoff, docking −0.8. Some paraphrase loops on "silence/stillness." Propulsion strong otherwise, high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop-pedal exorcism and color-spectrum epiphany transforms possession trope organically. Risky rhetorical structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via palette reveal. No derivatives; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
