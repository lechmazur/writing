<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rigidity trait drives initial dismissal of dust but yields to contradictory curiosity in kneeling/documentation choices; arc earns via micro-shifts like sketching over equations, embodied in "humility warmed his chest." Flaw complicates without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: daily observations densify to CR closure—"the lightness of belonging"—with legible cost in forfeited control ("frantic need to control meaning"); orientation anchored early, no shards violate scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Leaf/dust micro-setting constrains gaze/returns and charges final sacred-text image; sensory progression (iridescent powder to rainbows) mirrors POV scientist bias, evolves causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (strip drama) tightens accumulatively via observation density overriding efficiency, forcing surrender; agency in tarp-securing forecloses detachment with felt humility cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of decay-as-renewal emerges organically from dust shifts refusing equations; final leaf image reweights cosmic work non-literally, though bordering echo in "meaning accumulates quietly" slightly mutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (geometry/maps in decay); rhythmic modulation builds lyric texture under observation pressure, no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but patterned repetition ("dust patterns," "gradual change") creates minor paraphrase loops across middle beats, not obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Neutron-star/greenhouse synthesis transforms scientist trope via tactile decay poetry; risk in quiet accumulative arc feels inevitable, heightening humility stakes organically.</comment>
