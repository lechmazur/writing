<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's sensory interiority and micro-choices under the call's pressure reveal particular traits tied to loss; man's distinct frayed voice adds relational crucible. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "teach endings how to begin" feels told but doesn't flatten pivotal dialogue beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: Elara's final harbor image reconfigures estrangement with felt cost of sustained vigil. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene fits defaults, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's dripping pipes and booth constrain isolation, mirroring loop motif; glass disc charges final image as compass. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's melodic bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief signaled early via wrong-number purpose; call deepens pressure accumulatively, man's sob to breath narrowing to release hum with on-page cost of renouncing endless dialing. Agency in Elara's scale and urging forecloses loop path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loops as song conditions emerges via disc/call parallels, final harbor reweighting estrangement without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in melodic filters stable in close third; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, man's stammer vs. Elara's calm distinguishing voices. Rhythmic modulation heightens call's poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors woven into action; minor mixed vehicles (circulatory echoes, disc rotation) purposeful under textural lens but verge on overwrite in opening. No loops obscuring closure; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of booth therapist via harmonica/tunnel loops transforms grief trope; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
