<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in ritual polishing compels endurance against Kael; contradictory resolve in ignoring meter shows interior depth. Micro-choices like pressing cobalt marble reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds to CR closure in maze exhale and resonance image; cost legible in Kael's cracked meter and flight. Orientation anchored early in garden maze at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains via thorns sealing path, charges final image; phoenix vine mirrors stakes. Sensory details like jasmine and damp earth filter through Elara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (care vs. luck) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with Kael intrusion narrowing options. Agency in marble press forecloses threat with relational cost to closed hearts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mended deception emerges via polishing fissures with light, reweights premise in maze response without statement. Final resonance image answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with garden-biased perceptual signature; dialogue subtext sharp in "measure chance" vs. "measure care." Rhythm modulates from ritual calm to confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels texture, but stacked metaphors (veins like roots, emerald curtain) risk coherence in opening. No loops; rhythm varies with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Luck meters vs. living maze transforms trope of tech vs. nature; cracked marbles as chronicles synthesize fresh ingenuity tied to closure.</comment>
