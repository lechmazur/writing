<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's kindly methodical traits compel precise caching and stepping out, with embodied sense memories (cherry pipe tobacco) rooting motivation in contradiction between isolation and aid. Final step-out earns change via prior causality, foreclosing solitude with relational cost. Evans as secondary applies recognition pressure without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from caching to sunbeam placement ("precisely where the first direct sunbeam would strike it at 6:18 AM"), culminating in Charged Poise RR as Elara steps into dawn light, reconfiguring isolation with felt visibility cost. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library's pipe chases and ventilation grate constrain Elara's tactics; recurring light evolution (charcoal to sapphire hush to swirling gold) charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (scent of aged paper triggering memory) filters through POV, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. targeted visibility) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via timed placement and watchful wait, narrowing to Evans' gaze locking on fragment. Agency in retreat and step-out forecloses hiding path; cost legible in pounding heart and tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of intentional visibility as mercy emerges via tape's sparrow etching reprise, shifting from personal memory to shared sanctuary without statement. Final nod offers non-literal resonant answer to isolation's question, reweighting prior caching with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature via sensory bias (lemon polish sense memory); rhythmic modulation builds tension to dawn release. Sparse dialogue ("Elara?") natural, subtext-rich; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action, sense, interior (e.g., "Minutes stretched like taffy"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts. Figurative language purposeful (dust motes "igniting...into swirling gold") without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crawl space dweller premise synthesizes hidden preservation with emotional bridge, transformed via tape fragment's specificity; quiet dawn connection feels inevitable yet risky. No derivative echoes; bold in accumulative hush-to-light cadence.</comment>
