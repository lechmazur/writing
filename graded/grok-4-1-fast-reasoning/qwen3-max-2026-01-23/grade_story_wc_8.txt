<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of parallels tightening to CR closure in "the station felt peaceful, not haunted," where cost of myth's passing is legible in the bittersweet reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy and petal as micro-setting constrain the reflective action and charge the final image ("ivy seemed to sigh in release," "gilding the ivy"), mirroring internal release without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of sunlight-gilded ivy and lighter satchel offers resonant non-literal answer to noble lies' corrosion, reweighting particulars like the letter and station without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of historian's precise parallels and selective sensory bias (e.g., "rustling ivy") sustains rhythmic control under reflective pressure, with stable close-third POV.</comment>
