<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and earned change from errant seeker to guardian via micro-choices like tracing numerals; minor diagnostic slips like "thoughtfully clear focus" slightly abstract conflicting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to coordinates revelation as tightening; CR closure lands cleanly in "serene upheaval settled within her bones" with legible cost of foreclosed vengeance path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sundial as micro-setting constrains discovery and charges final pocketed image; sensory details like "moss-slick deck" and "canal’s gentle lap" mirror internal reconfiguration purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of integrity salvage deepens via revelation narrowing options from phantom chase to exposure; cost felt in old self's on-page burial, though internal pressure lacks sharper external complication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration; dense figuratives like "cathedral of deceit" purposeful but borderline overwrought in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of betrayal via hidden coordinates transforms expedition trope; bold lyric risk in quiet realization heightens quiet stakes organically.</comment>
