<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism and bone-setter traits drive concrete micro-choices like examining the tooth's cleft, embodying internal conflict between doubt and ache. Final resolve to educate elders feels earned via prior causality. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "shrewdly innocent precision" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure via tooth's "hairline cleft," reconfiguring village narrative with felt emotional cost in "sob escaped... liberation." Orientation anchored early in garden post-dawn discovery; single scene coherent, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden details like "dewy grass," "weeping willow," and "rosemary beds" filter through Elara's botanical/medical gaze, constraining her ritual under the willow and charging final "Lyra’s Compass" image. Sensory hierarchy matches calm urgency; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. superstition) signaled early, tightens via tooth revelation narrowing options to empathetic realignment. Agency in inspection forecloses faerie narrative; cost legible in "hollow ache." Accumulative deepening reweights without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bone-setting motif emerges organically to theme of mending beliefs, resonant in "turn this painful collective mistake into a constellation." Final image answers certainty question non-literally. Minor overtness in "mistakes... become constellations" borders echo but ties to particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in medical-botanical noticing (e.g., "fracture lines," "organic imperfection"). Lyrical rhythm modulates reflective intensity; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice distinct, prose compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but paraphrase loops around "cleft"/"bone" metaphors (e.g., repeated fracture alignments) and figurative density in reflective beats dull propulsion slightly. No closure artifacts; varied syntax supports cadence. Minor synonym churn on "yearned."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with bone-setter skepticism and constellation metaphor transforms tropes via tooth's irreplaceable flaw. Risky lyric reflection heightens thematic stakes without gimmick; "Lyra’s Compass" feels inevitable.</comment>
