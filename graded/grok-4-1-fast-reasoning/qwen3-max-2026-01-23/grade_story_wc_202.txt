<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in reverence over nostalgia, shown through embodied tears and micro-choices like tracing the star, earning her closure change. Interiority particular via child-memories anchored to present cues without unearned epiphanies. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses slightly limits peak complexity, but closure renunciation feels compelled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early pattern of painting-details taught by Cora's murmur builds density to RR closure ("The anchors held"), with legible cost in permanent shard-placement foreclosing personal possession. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (market, role, purpose). Single tightening via cumulative resonances suffices; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Market's comet dust and rope bridge constrain choices (stall navigation, descent), charging final image of transformed rooftops. Sensory details selective via translator bias (intuitions in brushstrokes), integrated into action. Paintings as micro-setting mirror internal states, evolving to niche placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect history) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through three painting-deepening revelations narrowing doubt to certainty. Agency in studying/holding fragment forces trade-off at closure (personal to communal anchor). Cost felt in tears and cooled glow; pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked histories/light-shadow emerges organically from particulars (knot, sparrow, Tear), reweighted in "every light leaves a shadow" callback without statement. Final image resonates non-literally, embracing ambiguity of eternal instants. No moralizing; complexity in Hemlock's solitude honors without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with translator's perceptual signature (resonances, ghost-spray). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with intensity (short sentences in "time dissolved"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Truth hides"), advances intuition anchors. No head-hopping; elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density in revelation beats (storm-lashed, resonance hummed) borders overwriting without harm to closure (-0.4). No loops/scaffold; propulsion clear via image-chains. Clean mechanics; specificity replaces generics (Sailor's Promise knot).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: translator decoding painting-anchors transforms intuition trope into causal reverence-engine. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; no derivatives. Final reconfiguration (city transformed) inevitable from particulars, bold without gimmick.</comment>
