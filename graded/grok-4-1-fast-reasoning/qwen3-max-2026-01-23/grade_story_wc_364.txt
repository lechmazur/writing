<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's meek-to-confident arc earns closure via embodied ritual and bartered memory cost, revealing traits through soot-stained hands and reverent movements; minor deduction for internal conflict told in backstory rather than simultaneous impulses in peak ritual beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure in restored arches and "abiding peace" filling sacrifice's hollow; orientation anchored by word 46, cost legible in "hollow space left by his barter."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glow-moss lantern, damp walls, and root-pierced cavern constrain ritual choices and mirror resolve; recurring azure light evolves from shattered to defiant, charging final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax resilience) signaled early tightens via ritual deepening under Accumulative lens, narrowing to sacrifice-tested agency; cost felt in memory void but lacks micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings emerges organically from silk ritual and restored grove, reweighting rubble-to-resilience without statement; final apple blossom offers resonant non-literal answer to sacrifice's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (soot-hands, blacksmith lens) and rhythmic modulation under stress; distinct diction like "coax resilience" sustains lyric texture to Charged Poise end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., silk pulsing advances plot/atmosphere); minor template cadence in action stems ("moved with," "felt") across descent but no closure touch or loops dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes transformed via blacksmith-magician barter and root-vein mechanics into fresh "coax from rubble" synthesis; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in azure defiance image.</comment>
