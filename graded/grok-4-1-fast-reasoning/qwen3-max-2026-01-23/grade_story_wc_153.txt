<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (pride tightening throat vs. vulnerability in sob) act simultaneously in the ritual beat, earning the final release of grief with embodied cost; Elara's compassionate certainty forces Kael's micro-choice to engage. Distinct voices in sparse dialogue reveal character under pressure. Flawless integration of flaw (defensive pride) into closure without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of spirits' chorus and shard luminescence builds to CR closure ("You are forgiven" in condensation), reweighting the premise of needed apology with emotional cost legible in Kael's sob and burden dissolving. Orientation anchored early (mangrove quest by para 1). Single scene with visionary shard pays off without shard-teaching waiver needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mangrove roots, blackwater, and shard constrain choices (journey mud, moonlight ritual placement) and charge final image (warm shard pulsing in hand). Sensory hierarchy (phosphorescent spirits' harmonies softening edges) reflects Kael's regret-filtered urgency. Micro-setting (condensation window) mirrors internal states through action without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal unsent regret) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ritual deepening (Elara's tracing evokes vision, narrowing to pre-decision hinge). Cost unmistakable in sob tearing chest, foreclosing grief path. Agency in yielding to evocation under coherent spirit pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love transcending silence emerges organically from shard ritual and Lena's whispered forgiveness in vision, offering resonant non-literal answer (new spirits' melody of peace) that reweights prior regret-material without moralizing. Final image (upturned face in moonlight) charges particulars with lingering ambiguity on silence's power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (regret as pounding rhythm, mud yielding without judgment) biases details character-specifically; Elara's dialogue subtextually pursues goal ("Look deeper"). Rhythmic control modulates from labyrinth density to visionary compression under stress. Clean free indirect in vision without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., condensation tracing advances revelation); rhythm varies read-aloud without monotony. Minor overwriting deduction for figurative density in opening ("bruised twilight, gnarled roots... noose of pride") persisting slightly into ritual without full pattern payoff, but closure image clear. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove mysticism and gargoyle shard transforms apology trope into pre-decision hinge realization; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via spirits' evolving chorus to charged closure without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight from letter jars to forgiveness reprise.</comment>
