<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Spatially imaginative trait roots motivation in concrete actions like pressing thumbs to sprockets, earning the realization; embodied emotions in "quiet ache stored" avoid labels. Minor slip in epiphany bordering unearned rationalization, but prior incubation anchors it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure—"unused love is stored... in the mercy of release"—with conceptual cost in soul-shaking transformation legible at "profound peace." Vision shard transitions legibly; orientation anchored early in booth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Projection booth constrains incubation choice; film strip as micro-setting charges final warm vessel image. Sensory details like "developer fluid" and "gas-lit room" filter through POV spatial bias, mirroring internal landscapes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to locate unused love—deepens accumulatively in vision's "extra second of held glance," narrowing to non-physical truth with felt cost in foreclosed quest. Agency via psychometry sustains pressure to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from film negative as metaphor for unsaid love, resonating in final "spatial map of release" without moralizing; reweights premise via Clara's ache preserved in halides.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with spatial perceptual signature—"hills of joy, valleys of sorrow"—modulates rhythmically; stable close third-person POV heightens immersion in psychometry without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; minor metaphor pile-up ("symphony of sorrow... emotional architecture") risks coherence in vision beat but pattern-taught as voice. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of psychometry and celluloid uncovers unused love in "silver halides," transforming mystic tropes through film-specific logic; fresh spatial-emotional mapping feels inevitable at close.</comment>
