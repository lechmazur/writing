<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority embodied in trembling fingers and tear amid hush; contradictory regret/acceptance drives fork release as earned renunciation with visible cost. Realization moment integrates clockwork as "quiet cousin" via miracle note, feeling character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in fork-nestled crystal and harmonized departure, reweighting dream with emotional cost legible in softened regret. Single scene oriented early; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains gentle steps and amplifies fork, charging final gilded image; petrichor, hush filter through POV's precise senses, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace with dream) signaled early, tightens via resonant note into stance crystallization; agency in kneeling/press/release forecloses abandonment path with felt integration cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transplanted dream emerges from fork-crystal vibration and clock-metronome realization, resonant in final walking image without moralizing; subtext in hush-to-embrace shift lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with selective perceptual signature (gear-like precision in senses); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from glacial to warm, consistent without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory images, but patterned artifacts (−1.2): "excruciatingly gentle" x3 and "petrichor nostalgia" loops create template cadence in opening/mid beats; no closure touch but dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh clock-music synthesis via quartz amplification transforms regret trope; risk in lyric hush-build to quiet CR feels organic, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
