<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied as "serpent tightening" conflicts with motivation's "quiet flame," driving micro-choices like focusing on gold's pulse; transformation to "profound peace" earned at message reveal with tears as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as descent density builds to Phase Transition Array activation, delivering CR/RR closure via frozen gold and message that reweights erasure with emotional cost in "tears welled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal "crashing hush" and ladder constrain choices throughout, with facility's "copper coils and frosted glass" charging climax; micro-object gold fleck recharges final image as "permanent star."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of witnessing grandfather tightens texturally against claustrophobia and tide, forcing endurance at valve turn; cost legible in "scramble up the ladder as a wave surged," altering escape tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance vs. silence emerges via cable "whispers" and message, resonant in final "enduring undersea cables" image reweighting premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("salt and decay," "fractal patterns") modulates with pressure; stable close-third POV biases toward gold's rhythm, rhythmic control heightens descent tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative ("cathedral of forgotten science") propels; minor metaphor density in chamber scene coherent, no loops obscure cause-effect or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious phase-transition cable reading and illuminant gold synthesize alchemy-science organically, transforming spelunker trope via "visible phase transition from vapor to ice" at climax.</comment>
