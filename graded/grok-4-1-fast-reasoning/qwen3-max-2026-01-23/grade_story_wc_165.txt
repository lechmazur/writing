<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Corbin's analytical traits drive precise, character-specific actions like verifying the seventh arch; old man's transformation earns validation with embodied warmth in chest. Minimal internal contradiction limits deeper complexity, but motivation compels the key nod of acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build to resonant reconfiguration at man's tearful smile and Corbin's nod; closure Charged Poise with cost of bishop's loss legible in "journeying in a stranger’s pocket." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via wave surge suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal advance, starlight on bishop, and moss-lined crevice constrain placement and charge discovery moment; sensory hierarchy (tide rhythm, footsteps) reflects Corbin's priorities. Final music intertwining with sea recharges setting without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrating serendipity signaled early tightens via man's approach and light flash narrowing to discovery; agency in observation and nod forecloses doubt with validation cost. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wonder amid routine emerges from particulars like bishop's "diagonal gaze seaward"; final image of music as "gentle offering" resonates non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in silent transaction invites ambiguity on connection's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature of subtle cues (rain-scent, footsteps); rhythmic prose modulates from attentive setup to resonant close. No dialogue; purposeful compression of observation sustains texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion via varied syntax and sensory density; minor paraphrase loops in "quiet" motifs ("quiet rebellion," "quiet life’s work") slightly dull momentum without touching closure. No major artifacts; read-aloud rhythm supports cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess bishop as serendipity vessel transforms routine setting into "silent poem"; risk of non-verbal climax heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from tidal/celestial calculations feels non-obvious.</comment>
