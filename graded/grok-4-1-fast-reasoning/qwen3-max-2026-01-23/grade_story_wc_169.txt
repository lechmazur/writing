<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through ritual to self-revitalization, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; serene competence without genuine struggle softens earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from ritual to village success to multi-timeline feedback loop, landing Charged Poise closure in sea whisper with felt cost of faltering timelines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto and tideline treasures constrain pattern-making choices and charge final sea image, mirroring internal polishing with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hope equations tightens accumulatively via shared dream success and feedback loop, narrowing to persistent cost of unseen drifts; agency in observation forecloses apathy path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spiral patterns shifting from village reawakening to multiverse resonance reweight hope as gentle process, emergent without moralizing; final tide embrace answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of mathematical grace stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation heightens watchful poise without elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but figurative layering (spirals, helices) slightly overwrites early propulsion without obscuring closure chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Multiverse gardener launching hope equations via tideline math transforms reverie tropes into inevitable serene upheaval; risky lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
