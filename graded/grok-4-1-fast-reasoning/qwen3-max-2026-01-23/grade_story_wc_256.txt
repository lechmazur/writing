<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover connection's texture drives concrete micro-choices like using the lens and bells, earning her change and Dr. Aris's awe. Interiority embodied via tears and listening to silence; contradictory impulses in gentle challenging of precision. Minor label-speak in repeated "powerfully gentle" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/sound builds to RR closure in Resonator's hum and melody emergence, reconfiguring lab with conceptual cost to Aris's certainty ("clinical certainty dissolved"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent. Lens taught early via shadows/sounds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Golden shadows and Resonator constrain choices, fracturing light into prismatic shards charges final image; sensory hierarchy (sound/light over sterile cases) reflects Elara's bias. Details tactile/lived-in, evolve causally (deepen/swirl). Carbide lens as micro-setting enables awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken sounds via connection vs precision) signaled early, textural escalation via prism-song density narrows options, forcing lab's stance crystallization. Agency in Elara's offering; cost legible in flatline then warmth ("a warmth felt in the chest"). One decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection as gardening vs archaeology emerges from particulars (lens on Resonator, music box melody), resonant CR in lab's transformation without moralizing. Subtext in silence's fertility; final image reweights sterile cases as "cradle of living dialogue."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in sound/light metaphors ("struck bell," "prismatic shards"); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("question that assumption"). Rhythm modulates with intensity; minor convergence in awe moment intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful light motifs propels, but figurative overload in peak ("golden shadows deepened, swirling like stirred ink") risks coherence (-0.4). Minor paraphrase loops ("powerfully gentle" x2); rhythm varies, no major scaffolds. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound archival lab with prism-song ritual transforms tropes; carbide lens and "lost sounds" yield non-obvious emotional bridge. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmick; "music box melody" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
