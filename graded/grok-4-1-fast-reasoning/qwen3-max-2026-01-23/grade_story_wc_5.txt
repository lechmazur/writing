<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in translating pulse to map compels ritual choices with embodied patience in gnarled fingers and blood drop; interiority concrete via tree's rhythm. Mild internal conflict as antithesis of craft mentioned but not dramatized simultaneously in pivotal vigil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building ritual pattern to RR closure: paper blooms into map, bud swells with dew-scent cost of vigil ache legible in final lines. Orientation anchored early in crater orchard; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard constrains via geometry pooling starlight, frozen earth testing precise placements; final bud glistens, recharging withered setting. Sensory hierarchy (hush, plume breath, dew scent) filters through alchemist's patient bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of permanence vs erosion tightens accumulatively to beam's descent not flashing to ash; agency in blood anchor forecloses failure with vigil cost felt in aching joints charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of heartbeat-to-map hope emerges via light weaving pulse into cartography; final bud/exhale offers resonant reconfiguration without moral, reweighting vanishing craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (celestial geometries, rhythms as drums) modulates rhythm under ritual stress; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off in transformed paper image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density ("liquid silver," "rivers of light") borders overwriting in climax without muddle; no loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual mapping pulse to starlight transforms endurance tropes; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes via fragile bud without gimmick.</comment>
