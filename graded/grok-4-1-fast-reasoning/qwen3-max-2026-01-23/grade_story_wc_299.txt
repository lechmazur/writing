<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between fact-insulation and emotional surrender peaks in "the ritual failed," earning the pivot to chronicler with visible cost of abandoning appraisals; minor diagnostic phrasing like "tidal wave of shame" slightly abstracts but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fact-density builds to memory pattern-break ("ritual failed") and Charged Poise closure ("pen scratch... authentically his own") with legible emotional cost in foreclosed appraisal path; orientation anchors early in trailer/quarry intro.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Trailer micro-setting (C-sharp floorboards, grimy window) and evolving cliffs constrain isolation-to-redemption arc, charging final "rose and gold" image; sensory filter via appraiser's facts (Cambrian limestone) feels lived-in without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose post-loss deepens accumulatively when ritual fails, forcing agency in emotional release and writing choice that forecloses old validation path; cost felt in "abandon auction houses," reweighting options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unapplauded service emerges organically from cloth/memory particulars, resonating in non-literal final image of pen-on-paper amid cliffs without moralizing; "echo valley longing" borders echo but integrates as charged motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fact-ritual diction ("Fane Acoustics weave") and rhythmic modulation under stress maintain stable close-third POV; no head-hopping or elision issues, prose texture reflects appraiser's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion (e.g., "frayed edges a compass"); minor paraphrase loops in "echo valley" repetitions purposeful for tone but slightly drag mid-section without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie grit/appraiser eye transforms midlife-pivot trope via relic-driven internal arc; "confidently uncertain" paradox on worthless cloth feels inevitable and risks emotional specificity over generic redemption.</comment>
