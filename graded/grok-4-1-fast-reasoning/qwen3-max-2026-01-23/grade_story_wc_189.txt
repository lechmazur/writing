<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via jade cicada and tidal observations compelling Elara's tangential method; Kael's change earned through mirrored vulnerability. Minor diagnostic slips like "warmly observant empathy swelled" slightly abstract peak emotion without full contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations layer to cadence shift at Kael's "old shell was too tight" whisper, delivering Charged Poise RR with legible relational cost in tear and softening. Orientation anchored early in grotto/tidal pool; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (starlight-fractured water, retreating tide trails) filtered through chronicler's bias constrain foresight choices and charge final refilling-pool image. Micro-setting (crab, anemone) mirrors stakes purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating pause via transition insight) signaled early, tightens texturally through deepening observations forcing Elara's memory prompt; Kael's seismic breath as agency-driven reversal narrows relational options with vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges organically from crab shell/anemone/cicada particulars, reweighted non-literally in final tide-reclaiming image without moralizing. Subtext in silences and peripherals charges quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (nature granularities); dialogue natural/subtextual ("old shell too tight" echoes crab). Rhythmic lyricism modulates with emotional softening, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in observational cadence, but minor paraphrase loops in cicada/transition refs (−0.4); no closure harm, read-aloud propulsion strong. Varied syntax supports textural build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal microcosms as relational foresight tool transforms reconciliation trope; tangential method and cicada reprise feel inevitable from established pattern without gimmickry.</comment>
