<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in vow drives all micro-choices with embodied grace; interiority concrete in pattern-seeing. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during threshold focus, keeping serenity dominant without tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to mandala snap (139), delivering RR closure in stabilized light and tear (203-205, 234) with felt cost of finality. Orientation anchored early; constraint of threshold shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurora and grotto constrain threshold perception (aurora stills 145), charge final image (aurora bows 262); selective sensory hush/hum mirrors ritual priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early (60), tightens accumulatively to mandala/infusion with agency in invitation-weaving (168); cost legible in passed threshold and release (187).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final vial galaxy (225) resonates as non-literal defiance of oblivion, reweighting patterns-into-memory without moralizing; emerges organically from ritual particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luminous perceptual signature (patterns in static) and rhythmic hush-modulation sustain close third POV; purposeful compression taught early, legible at charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene hush-to-release; high density but coherent figures (no muddle). Minor overwrite deduction for figurative density in infusion beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh cosmic-mortician ritual synthesis feels inevitable; lyric risk heightens stakes via pattern constraint, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
