<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's warmly inquisitive nature drives consistent micro-choices like donning the goggles (106), earning his realization; embodied emotion peaks in "throat tightened" (147). Internal conflict subtle but present via personal pilgrimage mirroring captain's loss. No strong contradictory impulses in peak beat limit 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelation density builds via floor chimes and light shifts, culminating in CR closure at "eyes trained to find the scattered light" (355) with perceptual cost legible. Single scene, orientation anchored by ~50 words. Lens taught early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scattered light recurs as micro-setting constraining revelation (95,198), charging final image; vivid sensory integration (hiss, whir, prismatic shards). POV bias filters spire's crystalline details purposefully. No white-room; spatial choreography tight in elevator.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher for joy beneath anguish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via light angles revealing deeper passages, narrowing to affectionate detachment (226). Agency in peering through goggles forecloses ignorance with emotional cost. One decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from captain's entries paralleling Kael's sister (190), resonant CR in "joy is not the absence of anguish, but its quiet, enduring companion" (291) reweights premise without statement. No moralizing; ambiguity in persistent grief lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (inquisitive lens on glyphs, memories); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. Lyrical diction purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding. Voice coherent, biased noticing (light on diary).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; figurative language (118,214) pattern-taught via light motif pays off without muddle. Minor overwriting in revelation beat ("shimmer, softening, realigning") risks opacity but clarity holds at closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: goggles as emotional lens via refracted light transforms cipher trope into personal epiphany. Risky lyric ascent heightens stakes without gimmickry; inevitable hindsight from elevator climb motif.</comment>
