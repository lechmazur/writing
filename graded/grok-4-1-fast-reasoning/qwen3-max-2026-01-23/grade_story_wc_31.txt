<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Defining attribute ("hiding behind truth") precisely constrains early deflection of grief but crumbles earned at log-reading climax, with embodied tears mingling seawater as pivotal cost; interiority concrete and contradictory impulses act in scene without epiphanic shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory/textural buildup to CR closure in key-leaving gesture and realization ("love’s chromatic signature was eternal"), with legible emotional cost at tears flooding "without resistance"; single scene anchors orientation early, one tightening via chest discovery suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains access (rusted hatch, mudflats) and charges final image (lantern light flooding log’s sentence), with POV-filtered sensory details (gilded spines, drifting silt) mirroring internal quest; porthole lanterns evolve causally with timeframe for purposeful vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover color of sound) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via log discovery narrowing obsession into grief confrontation; agency in key-turning and chest-closing forecloses hiding with on-page tear cost, one tightening coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of luminous vows emerges organically from log particulars ("liquid topaz" laughter) to resonant CR answer in final realization ("dawn’s gold" for Elara’s voice), reweighting premise without moralizing; no Thematic Echo despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV with light-obsessed perceptual signature ("honeyed light"); rhythmic modulation heightens emotional peaks (e.g., "gritty sigh" key-turn), no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("cathedral of drowned knowledge") integrated into action, varied rhythm propels to charged closure image; minor density slip in repetitive light descriptors but no loops or artifacts dulling peak tears beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic quest ("color of sound") in sunken library transforms grief tropes via specific log vows and key-leaving risk; inevitable hindsight from purposeful wandering to eternal light premise without hedging.</comment>
