<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find stories' dwelling fuses grandmother's folds with hyperbolic geometry in a earned internal shift (181-196), embodying contradictory impulses between seeking and internalizing with visible solitude's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of imagery and memory builds to CR closure at "She no longer sought a location" (251), with cost legible in shift from external quest to internalized atlas; orientation anchored early in library scene; single flashback shard transitions legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vellum chart and scarf as micro-settings constrain the reawakening ritual (92-109) and charge final image of "living atlas of connection" (251); sensory details like lavender and silk texture filter through Elara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of locating stories tightens via reawakening deepening (121-196) under Accumulative lens, narrowing external search to internal reconfiguration with felt cost of filled solitude; agency in ritual focus forecloses prior digital rejection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of curved narrative space emerges implicitly from scarf folds and geometry map, answered non-literally in final "infinite geometry" image (259) that reweights analog soul without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with geometric-poetic perceptual signature ("hyperbolic crochet model," 29) modulates rhythmically through memory immersion; stable single POV; sparse dialogue in flashback natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but inline word-count artifacts like (19) create minor scaffold obscuring immersion; no loops or muddled metaphors touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library fused with hyperbolic story geometry offers fresh synthesis, transformed tropes via Elara's ritual yielding inevitable CR hindsight payoff.</comment>
