<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses peak in pressing the stone despite nerve pain, earning the final memorial choice; motivation rooted in guilt compels higher-stakes micro-choices. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "unpardonable silence" edges toward label-speak but stays anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening realizations from discoloration press to bolt discovery to desk placement; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with legible emotional cost in "frostbitten hope" rooting amid pain. Orientation anchored early in fortress duties; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "exhaling air scented of aged wood" and dust-shrouded piano constrain choices (pain on steps) and charge final image (open door crack). POV-filtered specificity mirrors internal fracture without overt symbolism; micro-setting (bolt, stone) elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cost of silence/safety) signaled early, deepens via bolt linking Kael's care to her guilt; agency in investigating forecloses return to blind routine with felt cost (tears freezing). Escalation coherent under accumulative lens, though internal-heavy limits visceral peaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence vs. vigilant truth emerges organically from particulars like protocol fracture and bolt anchor; final nod and bolt on desk offer resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Complexity lingers in earned ambiguity of ongoing pain-as-purpose.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature in frost-laden diction modulating from hush to hum; Kael's ghostly voice natural and subtextual. Rhythmic control supports pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative texture ("nerve-fire," "ice flower") taught early, varying rhythm propels without loops; minor density in reflective beats doesn't obscure closure image of bolt placement. Varied syntax and strong verbs maintain propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane fortress duties and hidden chamber discovery transforms guilt trope via bolt's specific memory-charge; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious "acoustic purity" protocol drives ingenuity.</comment>
