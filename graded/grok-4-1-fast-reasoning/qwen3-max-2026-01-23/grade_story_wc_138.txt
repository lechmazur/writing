<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's quest for "what happens after goodbye" compels the pivotal step through the tear, earned by embodied ennui as "weight heavier than stone" clashing with his "fragile ember"; transformation to purpose via tears shows contradictory impulses resolved with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from solitude to revelation; on-page CR in "after goodbye came remembrance" reweights premise with conceptual cost of lifted curse, legible in amulet's dissolution and sanctuary's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic geode constrains initial boredom and charges final image as crystals gain "soft internal luminescence, colors deeper, warmer"; sensory details like "bioluminescent fungi light" filter through dimensional awareness bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping boredom tightens via storm-amulet anomaly narrowing to journey choice; accumulation forces stance crystallization in revelation with felt cost of tears washing "dust and despair."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance as goodbye's after emerges organically from absorbed farewells and library repository; final "rainbows that felt like promises" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of "dimensional awareness" perceiving fields as "luminous silken threads"; rhythmic control modulates from torment to peace, prose texture apt for mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in opening metaphors like "boredom to a flawless, suffocating sheen" slightly dulls early propulsion without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortality trope via "spatial mutiny" and goodbye repository feels inevitable; risk of cosmic lyricism heightens stakes through particular magnetic curse mechanics.</comment>
