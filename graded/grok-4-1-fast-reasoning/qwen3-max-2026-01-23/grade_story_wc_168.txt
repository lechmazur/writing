<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scarred arms tightening and gently skilled hands tracing fractures embody resilience and internal conflict; realization of innocence as resilient seed earned via concrete cues like soot-smudged drawing and box's fractures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from ridge solitude to CR closure in "Enlightenment bloomed... evolution into wisdom," reconfiguring innocence with legible cost of acceptance; orientation anchored immediately in Elias, path, box.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridge granite, compassionate moonlight, and porcelain cracks as micro-setting constrain reflection and charge final image of box as compass; sensory selectivity (boots whispering, pine breeze) mirrors scarred grace without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to enlighten on bargained innocence tightens accumulatively through deepening reflections on cracks/scars; agency in honoring fractures forecloses pristine preservation with felt cost of transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Scars/cracks/embers motif emerges organically to reweight innocence as evolved wisdom; resonant CR in final keeper-of-embers image answers central question non-literally, though "syntax of scars" edges toward direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in fracture-as-map noticing; rhythmic poetic diction ("hard softness," "searing personal pain") modulates intensity consistently without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density (metaphors in most sentences) and paraphrase loops (multiple adjacent restatements of transformation/cracks as endurance) dull propulsion in reflective climax; template cadence in "He [reflect/action]" runs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter trauma via porcelain alchemy and scar-syntax language transforms reflection trope; bold lyric risk in celestial framing heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
