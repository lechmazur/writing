<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in past-life ache compel the healing breaths; final transformation to "active compassion" earned with felt emotional cost in tears and release. Contradictory impulses (regret vs. curiosity) act simultaneously in the obscura-peering ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as breaths tighten revelations into CR closure; "golden light brightened, then softened, flowing... dissolving the memory’s sharp edges" delivers legible conceptual cost of regret transmuted. Orientation anchored early in viaduct scene; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (jasmine perfume, moss-veined railing) filters through artist's priorities, constraining choices like obscura assembly; recurring sparks and stone heart charge final glowing viaduct image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate/release stored love) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via breath-deepening density narrowing to stone heart; agency in "conscious pause at the peak of inhalation" forecloses regret path with on-page cost of dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved love as "potential... stored until compassion breathes it into release" emerges organically from breaths and sparks, resonant in final "her breath a quiet prayer" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of light/shadow alchemy stable in single POV; rhythmic syntax modulates with breath cycles, heightening ritual pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in breath sequence, but dense figurative layering ("inverted world bloom," "cerulean beam") borders overwriting in revelation beat without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura as spiritual lens with breath-alchemy transforms love/regret trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
