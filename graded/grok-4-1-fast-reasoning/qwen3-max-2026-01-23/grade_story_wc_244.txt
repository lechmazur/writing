<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—jocularity as armor vs. scoffing at absurdity—earning final choice to pass stone with visible cost of abandoning solo quest. Interiority concrete and particular, rooted in moon rock memory; change credible via anchored backstory tilting present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density and rumor chain build to RR closure in "Her motivation transformed," reconfiguring loneliness premise with felt opportunity cost of permanent post. Orientation anchored early in station description; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station and moon rock micro-setting constrain waiting choice and charge final image: "ivy was not decay, but resilient life," mirroring internal shift through tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness cure) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at stranger's arrival—"the precise timeframe when the story changed"—forcing stance crystallization via passing stone, with legible cost in dissolved jocularity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from stone-passing and rumor chains, culminating in non-literal resonant answer: notebook invitation reweights isolation without moralizing. Final image of "calm anticipation" invites reflection via charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature—professional lens filters wildflowers defiantly amid cracks; rhythmic modulation under pressure, minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("Sunlight fractured through centuries of emerald vines") slightly dulls propulsion without obscuring closure; no loops or artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logistician seeking connection via moon rock reciprocity chain transforms loneliness trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
