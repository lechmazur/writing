<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's devotion motivates precise ritual choices, embodied in her tear of connection during the climax; interiority concrete via humming and guiding echoes. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, yielding earned stasis without peak ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to name-emergence tightening, resolving in Charged Poise closure ("Your fracture gives them voice") with felt solitude cost legible in final murmur. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits defaults without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal library and cracked tube constrain ritual choices (lens adjustment, echo capture) and charge final image (fingertip trace); sensory details (whispers, glow) filtered through Elara's priorities integrate purposefully. No white-room; micro-setting (tube, orchids) evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) signaled early, escalates via light-triggered density under Accumulative lens, narrowing to foxglove-weighted echoes; agency in guiding culminates in endurance with visible cost (solitary duty honored). One tightening suffices; cost unmistakable in tear and realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness-to-remembrance emerges organically via crack/echo motif shifting to "beauty emerges from brokenness"; final image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Minor overtness in closing line ("highest form of love") tempers peak resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (systematic tenderness in noticing petals, runes); rhythmic modulation heightens ritual pressure. No dialogue or head-hopping; diction biased to Elara's devotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (whispering shoes to pulsing orchids); density high but "foxglove regret" loops twice without payoff dull momentum slightly. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("note both whole and broken") during peak avoids muddle but risks elevation drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct feelings library, sonic orchids, cracked-tube ritual transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes via irreplaceable premise logic. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
