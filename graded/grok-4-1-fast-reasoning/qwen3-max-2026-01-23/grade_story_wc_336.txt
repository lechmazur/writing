<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in traits intensifies credibly to compel the weaving choice, embodied in gnarled hands and tear; interiority concrete via perceptual weave. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, reading more declarative than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: seed pulses and worlds harmonize with felt emotional cost in the tear. Single continuous scene fits defaults; orientation anchored immediately in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (mist like liquid silver, emerald moss) filtered through orchard pruner's priorities constrains perception during weaving, charging final seed glow. Environment mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wonder signaled early tightens accumulatively via gray threat vision and strand-gathering agency, narrowing to seed-channeling with legible tear-cost at peak. Escalation coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. gray emerges organically from color threads and weave, reweighted non-literally in final bud's gold-green hint. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing, though complexity leans declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in chromatic emotion-weaving; rhythmic poetic texture modulates effectively. Elevated diction risks register drift from pruner's lexicon in sustained lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density in every weaving sentence (e.g., "threads of light swirled—crimson of forgotten apples") creates list-like paraphrase loops on colors/light, dulling propulsion. Template cadence in repetitive wonder/light phrasing triggers −1.2 total artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of essence-weaving into seed transforms folklore trope through pruner's sensory particulars and wonder-stake. Risky lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
