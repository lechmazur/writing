<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation from the audit violation roots defiance in personal trauma, compelling micro-choices like planting the seed; Dr. Petrova applies confirming pressure via coded reply. Internal conflict subtle but embodied in trembling hands vs. steady voice. Final beacon shift earned but lacks strong contradictory impulses in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed planting to converging arrivals and cicada song, yielding Charged Poise closure where moonlight ripple and star reconfigure individual spark into collective garden with dawn risk cost legible in "dawn would bring risk" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse as sanctuary constrains surveillance evasion, with humid nightshade air and silvered glass charging final image; sensory details like pinned butterflies and fern adjustment filter through Aris's botanical bias, evolving with twilight bleed to pulse as cathedral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unmonitored thought via gardens tightens through news convergence and cicada activation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to moonrise warp with agency in seed's promise; cost felt in personal audit echo and dawn risk, charging poise without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective defiance via living manuscript emerges organically from garden patterns and spark motifs, reweighted in final "defiance was not a solitary act, but a garden tended together" image answering taxation's gravity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Aris with perceptual signature in cryptic-botanical diction ("soil pH has shifted"); dialogue subtextual and idiomatic, advancing via coded confirmations; rhythmic control modulates from cryptic murmur to resonant hum under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "root pushing through darkness" propel without loops; rhythm varies read-aloud from short urgent whispers to expansive final image. Minor elevated diction fits voice but borders register drift in epiphanic close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical ciphers against cognitive taxation transforms resistance tropes via precise garden geometry and cicada mimicry; risk in "biologically impossible" song heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from seed linchpin.</comment>
