<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in aesthetic drive compels paraphrase choices effectively, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; smooth conviction without internal friction limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through successive paraphrases building to Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in "scar was healed" and fragile union image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz pillars constrain paraphrase action and charge final "gateway" image; sensory details (hum, shimmer) filtered through aesthetic POV bias vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to dissolve boundary tightens accumulatively via paraphrases narrowing divide; agency in lines like "Where stone stood firm let light now flow" forces trade-off, cost felt in boundary's "sigh."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of poetry connecting via dissolution emerges organically; final "living paraphrase of boundaries made permeable by beauty" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (aesthetic noticing of "watercolor" blur, "diamond sparks") stable; rhythm syncs with quartz hum/thrum under rising intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but minor paraphrase loops in ending reflection ("not to conquer but to connect not to destroy but to dissolve") create redundancy dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of language-as-magic in paraphrase premise feels inevitable; bold poetic risk heightens aesthetic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
