<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's disenchantment roots clear motivation, with embodied internal conflict (hollowing spirit vs. steady flame) driving micro-choices like shedding cloak; fox encounter reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final purpose earned via revelation with felt cost of self-confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (climb, fox exhale, grotto entry) narrows to CR closure in starlight tapestry, reweighting kingdom as mirror; orientation anchored early; one tightening at revelation suffices with undeniable conceptual cost in "wounded spirit" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Treacherous path and dew-slick ledge constrain climb choices; azurite veins and obsidian altar charge revelation image; sensory hierarchy (thinning air sharpening skin, sizzling drops) mirrors internal urgency without tourist catalog; cobalt grotto subtly guides to core alcove.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams before light fades) signaled early via obsidian warning; density increases through climb pressure and fox micro-turn, deepening to self-mending realization; agency in speech to starlight forces trade-off, with cost legible in foreclosed withdrawal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragile strength emerges organically from particulars (fireflies mirroring hope sparks, starlight as kingdom wound); subtext in lacy menace transforming perception; final image reconfigures sovereignty non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (softly commanding voice stirring amid stone/sky); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from menace to rose-gold purpose; single dialogue line natural, subtext-laden; no head-hopping, compression purposeful for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths on ledge, flowing prose in chamber); high density integrates action/image; figurative language consistent in lyric pattern without muddle, though "delicate, intricate" near-repeat nudges minor opacity; closure image propels cleanly.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mythic climb trope transformed via introspective starlight mirror and firefly hope weave; fresh synthesis of disenchantment as communal wound feels inevitable; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
