<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's immunity and family-driven resolve compel micro-choices like touching the compass and noting coordinates, earning her shift from grief to navigation. Interiority embodied in breath catching at the glimpse and steady hands amid thrill. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "motivation was no longer passive grief" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via ritual to glimpse pattern-break, culminating in CR closure ("True north had always been the journey itself") with conceptual cost of reframed exile. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. One tightening at Lyre glimpse narrows passive grief into active hypothesis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distorted starlight and warped viewport constrain sketching, mirroring internal shift; gilded compass as micro-setting charges final image, guiding resolve. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (astronomical bias). Compass touch in pivotal moment elevates to 9+ test pass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode legacy via sketching) signaled early, tightens at glimpse forcing hypothesis and note-taking agency. Accumulative escalation via cadence shift reweights solitude as partnership with cost of endless expedition. Minor abstractness in stakes keeps from higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity as true north emerges organically from sketch-ritual, glimpse, and compass callbacks, resonating in final "symphony waiting for her next stroke." Non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing. Strong counter-reading in pariah isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: temporal/astral bias in "light...smeared across minutes like ink." Rhythmic modulation builds to crystalline end. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("no longer" reframings of grief-to-purpose across 6+ lines) and synonym churn ("confusion shattered...deliberate exploration") dull density in reflective beats (-0.8). Rhythm varies but template cadence in endings ("She was no longer..."). Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal anomaly breadcrumbs and generational sketching trains perception for sci-fi myth-making. Glimpse-to-navigation turn inevitable from setup. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
