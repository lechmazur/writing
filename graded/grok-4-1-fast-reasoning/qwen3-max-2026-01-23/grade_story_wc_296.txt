<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied contradiction in unbending (shoulders loosening, tears of release); final acceptance earned via prior rigidity causal chain, with visible emotional cost; single-POV interiority particular and pressure-tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: expanding circles densify to RR closure (thawing confession) with legible cost in soul's unbending; orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shard violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vortex and lake constrain ritual choices (vines target essence); final sapling charges image; selective sensory (swirling mist, thorny vines) mirrors internal thaw without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, deepens via memory circle revelation narrowing to self-confrontation; agency in unbending forecloses armored path with on-page vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-compassion emerges organically from plant's cleansing and confession thaw; resonant final image reweights solitude without moralizing; minor over-articulation in "wound to heal" line tempers peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (warlike serenity bias); rhythmic modulation peaks in chant circles; purposeful poetic compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops; figurative language coherent and pattern-taught (thorns/ice motifs); minor density in opening metaphors avoids peak beat muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of purifying carnivore plant and circle ritual transforms druid tropes; unbending as core turn inevitable from particulars; risk in lyric fantasy heightens emotional stakes.</comment>
