<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the hesitation beat ("clutch the pearl’s solitary burden, or release it"), earning the closure choice through embodied grief (choked sob at wife's etching) and inspector traits spotting the shell's gleam; no unearned epiphanies, flaws complicate via fanciful belief balanced with practical hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from cave hush to shell discoveries to ritual eruption; on-page RR closure ("vault door within his chest swing open") with legible emotional cost in the final image of lighter burden and transformed purpose; orientation anchored early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain choice (quartz cradle nests shell) and charge final image (golden light flows from crowned shell, illuminating facets); sensory hierarchy via inspector's eyes (hairline fractures in steel → pearlescent gleam); subtle mirroring of isolation dissolving without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (dissolve heart walls) signaled early, deepens texturally through mirrored confessions narrowing to hesitation reversal; agency in crowning forecloses isolation with felt cost ("burden transformed"); one decisive intensification suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (empathy vs. isolation apocalypse) emerges organically from pearl-shell union and light wave, reweighting bunker life in final realization without statement; resonant non-literal answer in "quiet rebellion" image lingering with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (inspector's fracture-trained eyes); rhythmic modulation builds to compression in hesitation ("Time compressed into the single, suspended duration"); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short hesitation sentence amid flowing prose) propels to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; selective overwriting enhances textural lens without opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker isolation and cave ritual transforms grief tropes via shell-etchings mirroring regrets; risk-taking in geologic-breath lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at pearl placement.</comment>
