<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation to hush prophecy intensifies through embodied focus ("tranquil blaze"), compelling the climax hush with earned satisfaction. Interiority concrete via silence mapping, revealing character-specific calm under pressure. Minor abstractness in "recognize the lie" lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from flow to fracture detection to hush, yielding RR closure as prophecy unravels and wing dissolves with felt cost (wing's purpose fulfilled). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early ("nocturnal haven"). Lens taught by midpoint, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal haven and brook constrain ritual (merges awareness with brook's rhythm), charging final image (brook as "liquid hope"). Sensory hierarchy auditory-focused, purposeful for silence mapping. Vivid, selective details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush coded prophecy) signaled early, escalates via deepening to fracture ("cold sting") and hush narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Agency in exhale forecloses discord with legible cost (prophecy's dissolution). One tightening sufficient, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate silence over discord emerges organically from hush unraveling prophecy. Final image reweights prophecy as lie without literal statement. Borders thematic echo in "proving that the most powerful magic lies in...listen deeply and respond with compassion," replacing image density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in silence contours ("valley" between chirps). Voice rhythmic, modulates intensity ("tranquil blaze" to "embers"). Purposeful poetic compression legible under Accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax hush beat with stacked figures ("silvery ripples, softening...thorned vine to salt in water") muddles propulsion (−0.6). Paraphrase loops on peace/silence ("profound calm...clean silence...unbroken peace") dull density. Rhythm varies but template cadence in descriptive runs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-mapping ritual transforms prophecy trope via origami wing and hush. Risky lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars like "mapping silence" feel inevitable at closure.</comment>
