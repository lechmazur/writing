<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driven motivation to harvest failure insight compels ritual micro-choices under regret's pressure; embodied tears and steady breath mark earned shift from pride to yielding humility in flute vision climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to on-page CR closure—"true strength lay in yielding"—with legible emotional cost in tears and lighter spirit; orientation anchored early in canyon by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sun-warmed sandstone, juniper limb alignments, and canyon walls constrain ritual choices and charge final resonant hush; sensory hush deepens insight image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting insight tightens via flute note's deepening vision of past tear, forcing acceptance renunciation with tears as felt cost; agency in sustained playing forecloses rigid control path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of humility in listening emerges organically from weave fracture vision to reed-bending strength realization; final ember-carrying walk reweights premise without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of reverent quiet bias; rhythmic diction modulates from frantic echoes to imbued peace, perceptual filter consistent in stone-spirit press.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful hush repetitions building texture; minor "avalanchingly quiet" loop and "solemn action of uncase" awkwardness slightly dull propulsion but pattern serves lyric hush payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sonic weaving ritual synthesizes relic mysticism with failure harvest into fresh, grounded insight arc; canyon lean-in risks lyric compression heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
