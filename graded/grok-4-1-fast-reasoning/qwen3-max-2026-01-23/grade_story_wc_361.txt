<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion peaks in tears freezing on cheeks during germination; jitter-to-steady arc earned via pendant resonance. Interiority concrete and particular, with micro-choice to kneel revealing values. Minor epiphanic summary at end slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from memory gust to pendant hum to earth trembling, culminating in Conceptual Repricing via plant as memory-to-myth bridge. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (ridgeway, courier). Closure cost legible in reframed absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and frost-rimed stones constrain resonance ritual and charge final plant image; sensory details (pine scent, granite crunch) selective via POV urgency. Micro-setting (cracked stone, barren earth) guides germination choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle wonder vs. jitter) signaled early, tightens texturally via pendant activation forcing跪下 and germination. Cost felt in tears and foreclosed void. Escalation coherent but internal-heavy, lacking sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of germinating wonder from routine emerges organically through plant as living bridge; final image reweights memory-to-myth without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in ridgeway's transformed potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibrations, auroral pulses); rhythmic prose modulates from jittery to steady poise. No head-hopping or leakage; voice biased toward relic-courier's wonder-seeking lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative overload in climax ("spun moonlight," "swirling with captured auroral light") risks muddle; minor "vibration"/"luminous" repetition dulls peak propulsion without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sympathetic resonance magic transforming personal memory into shared legend via germinating plant; pendant's attribute risks bold premise implications fully without retreat, heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
