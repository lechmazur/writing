<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in sacred thresholds drives persistent micro-choices like tracing wood grain; embodied emotions peak in the tear amid acceptance. Interiority particular via maze echoes in whorls, earning change without unearned epiphany. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "featherly determined resolve" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure: "She had discovered the answer" reconfigures grief into purpose with emotional cost legible in tear and "necessary distances honored." Orientation anchored early in prism terrace; single scene fits scope. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and bench constrain reflection, with emerald light shift illuminating spiral grain to charge final image. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's tactile grain analysis and fractured light mirrors internal states purposefully. Micro-setting (logbook, bench) evolves causally, grounding ethereal space tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why thresholds sacred) signaled early, tightens via logbook code deepening to "life’s metaphor," narrowing to acceptance under accumulative lens. Agency in intuiting connection forecloses grief path with felt tear cost. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, charging ending without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges organically from mazes, flight diversion, wood echoes; final terrace edge image offers resonant answer without moralizing. Mother's recalled words interweave subtext, avoiding binaries via painful gap transformed. Minor echo in realization line ("thresholds feel sacred precisely because") borders directness but ties to particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in maze/wood bias; lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compressing insight at "SEEK CLEAR" glow. Purposeful elision of backstory anchors to present cues like bench whorls. Diction controlled, perceptual filters consistent under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels via image integration, but "fractured hush" recurs 5x and "necessary distances" loops paraphrase-style across beats, dulling late momentum. Minor figurative density in opening ("breathless space... fractured hush") without pattern payoff risks overwrite. Closure image clear despite artifacts not touching CR unit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn mazes, pilot codes, butterfly effect into threshold metaphor transforms grief tropes via prism refraction. Risky lyric structure heightens emotional specificity without gimmick; final reconfiguration inevitable from logbook-maze linkage. No derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
