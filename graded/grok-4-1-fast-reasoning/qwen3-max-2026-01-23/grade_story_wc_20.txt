<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via tear tracing "clean path through grime" embodies regret without labels; micro-choices like precise coin placement reveal values under pressure. Contradictory resolve vs. guilt acts in pouring starlight despite echoes of failure. Minor diagnostic slips like "balanced alchemist" don't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual density builds to resonant reconfiguration: crucible fuses with "golden veins," reweighting guilt as "sacred anchor." Orientation anchored early ("rain-washed foundry"); closure cost legible in "no longer a burden but a guiding star." No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rainwater "pooling like liquid obsidian" and sapphire flames constrain ritual (hearth, anvil); sensory hierarchy narrows to glow and hum under focus. Final image charges closure: dawn gilds "pulsed" crucible. POV bias filters grimy intimacy purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem Kael's failure) signaled early, deepens via luminous echoes and tear into pouring—agency forecloses erasure for "honoring fractures." Accumulative pressure reweights with humility cost; no reversals needed. Minor abstractness in "philosophy of kintsugi" doesn't dull peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of fracture-to-resilience emerges via shards-to-veins; final "luminous seams" non-literal answer to redemption sans erasure. Subtext in coin's pulse and name's weight avoids sermonizing. Slight over-articulation in ending lines borders thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV; perceptual signature biases to alchemical mysticism ("factually mystical warmth"). Rhythm modulates from heavy air to "light upon her tongue." No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density in ritual beats, but "luminous" loops (regret, gold, seams) and paraphrase in ending ("mended... renewed") create minor churn. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no template cadence. Figurative coherence holds, but overwriting in echoes dulls one peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi-alchemy-mysticism transforms tropes via "factually mystical" ritual; risk in solo redemption arc heightens emotional specificity. Irreplaceable coin-shard fusion inevitable from setup.</comment>
