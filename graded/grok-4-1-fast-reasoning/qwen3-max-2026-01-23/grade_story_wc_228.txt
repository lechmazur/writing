<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (cling to grief vs. release) act vividly in the cave placement beat, earned by prior causal buildup from mirror crack to fall; embodied emotions like "quiet ache" and pigment fingers root traits concretely. Final renunciation forecloses possession path with felt cost, scaling perfectly to length. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mirror crack through fall and cave to CR closure where shell placement reweights grief with legible cost ("beauty resides in the fractures"). Orientation anchors early (quay painter, harbor); one tightening (wrong turn) suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled fissure constrains pivotal fall; bioluminescent pool and sand charge final image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory details (salt air, echoing darkness) selective via painter's bias (light gradients, sea-glass). Environment evolves causally, pressuring navigation without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (promise-keeping vs. release) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fall deepening knowledge; agency in shell placement forecloses clinging path with on-page cost. Moral calculus (preservation as devotion illusion) sharpens peak. No abstract stakes or unearned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" emerges organically from shell's gradient to cave realization, final image reweights without moralizing; resonance from particulars like painted gull and light shift lingers ambiguously. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with painter's perceptual signature (colors bleeding, sea poetry); rhythmic prose modulates from urgent ("tumbling into fissure") to poised closure. No head-hopping or register drift; diction reflects nostalgic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (e.g., "liquid starlight") taught early, varying rhythm without loops; minor figurative density in cave beat doesn't obscure closure propulsion. No scaffold, template cadence, or muddled vehicles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-fracture and painter's lens transforms release trope; cave oasis and shell reprise feel inevitable from harbor setup. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
