<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in rational love for sister drives foraging and smuggling; involuntary truthfulness constrains via checkpoint honesty, enabling passage with risk; embodied resolve shows contradictory hope vs. failure awareness without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via orchard images and ritual anticipation to Charged Poise closure; truffle find tightens stakes with cost of potential ritual failure legible in final resolve; single scene with anchored flashback shard holds coherence, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains foraging post-storm and mirrors psyche's fractured resilience, charging ridge-top image; sensory details (rain-slicked stones, damp soil) selectively filter through Elara's rational gaze, evolving with ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sister's safety signaled early, tightens texturally via truffle discovery narrowing to ritual attempt; pressure coheres in smuggling past and failure risk, with agency in endurance foreclosing despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fractured grace theme emerges organically from battered orchard and ritual acts, reweighted in final rebellion image without moralizing; subtext of rational cultivation vs. virus pain lingers via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of rational observation (e.g., "subtle bulge of the truffle"); lyrical rhythm modulates with resolve, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, motif without loops dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase in repeated "fractured grace" purposeful but slightly overwrites closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus, truffle ritual, hanging orchard transforms healing tropes into inevitable rational rebellion; risk in discredited method heightens stakes organically.</comment>
