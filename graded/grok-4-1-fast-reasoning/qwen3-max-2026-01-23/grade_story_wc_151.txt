<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to craft resonant pseudonyms drives concrete micro-choices like evaluating "Lyra" vs. "Corbin"; chalk deciphering reveals contradictory impulses between meticulous craft and spontaneous truth, earning the final name shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from name evaluation to chalk discovery to mailing; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with legible emotional cost in "clipboard felt lighter" and ritual release, orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Golden arcade's polished floor supplies chalk codes that constrain name choice; dawn light evolves to "gild the arcade" in final image, charging nostalgic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of perfect farewell pseudonym tightens accumulatively via chalk reversal (tears, new insight), narrowing calculated options to resonant release; agency in kneeling/deciphering forecloses prior names with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in margins emerges via chalk vs. clipboard but weakens with overt statements like "the margin had spoken louder than the text" and mentor quote in final paragraphs, bordering on moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias to overlooked details (chalk amid grandeur); rhythmic modulation heightens dawn's resonance without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Evocative rhythm but paraphrase loops in final third ("meaning...in the margins" thrice, "futuristic nostalgia" repeated) dull propulsion; minor synonym churn on "resonance" creates artifact drag touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh pseudonym-via-chalk synthesis transforms sci-fi tropes into human-digital tension; chalk bird's "mission accomplished" offers ingenious, hindsight-inevitable turn grown from setting particulars.</comment>
