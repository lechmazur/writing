<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to bridge wisdom drives micro-choices like using the ribbon, with embodied emotion in the throat lump; internal conflict between old roots and new growth acts simultaneously in repair attempts. Final reconciliation earned via prior causality, foreclosing rigid repair path with relational cost. Minor slip in overt diagnostic phrasing during epiphany, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from repair insufficiency to bag revelation to ribbon weaving, culminating in Charged Poise RR at mother-daughter touch on ribbon with emotional cost legible in tears and apology. Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara in cathedral-orchard). Lens taught early via reclamation imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: orchard sway vulnerabilities demand cherry-branch supports and ribbon weaving; quartz eye magnifies fractures. Sensory details selective via POV (moss, blossoms, whispers mirror renewal). Final image charges with fluttering ribbon in breeze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (generational bridge) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tool insufficiency deepening to ribbon realization narrowing rigid vs. flexible repair options. Agency in persisting with bag contents forecloses old ways with vulnerability cost. Minor abstractness in stake declaration slightly mutes visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilient promises emerges organically from orchard breach, ribbon weaving, and dialogue; final image of shared pew reweights "deciduous vows" non-literally. Subtext in silences and traces carries ambiguity. −0.4 for thematic echo in Elara's line "Vows aren’t unbreakable chains...", bordering sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (quartz-eye focus on fractures/stories); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to terse in emotional peaks. Dialogue natural, subtextual ("You used my ribbon"), distinct voices (Elara rough, Lyra whispered). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm suits accumulative build; metaphors purposeful (amber tears, golden scar) without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening sunlight-fractured description (−0.2), but no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Propulsion clear to final knot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quartz-eye mender weaving daughter's ribbon into cathedral-orchard vows transforms mother-daughter rift trope; deciduous concept inevitable from breach imagery. Risky lush-fantasy realism heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
