<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's observant trait and compulsion drive concrete micro-choices like dust analysis and ladder ascent; vow to find Clara feels earned with solemn cost, though minimal contradictory impulses limit peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: observations because light dies therefore ghost manifests therefore panel opens; closure RR via ghost's fade with legible 70-year burden cost in "weightless burden of seventy years dissolving."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust patterns and ceiling seam constrain choices, charging final image; fluorescent buzz dying anchors timeframe and perceptual hierarchy via Leo's professional attunement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover ceiling secret) signaled early tightens via ghost's mime narrowing to panel discovery; agency in patient wait and vow forecloses inaction with felt vow-cost, though no live trade-off in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Love as persistent "crack in the façade" emerges via barrel/photo particulars, reweighted non-literally in chime and warm photo image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (dust as "historical document") stable; rhythmic modulation builds from buzz-vibration to serene stillness without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful sensory weave (buzz in teeth, ethereal gleam); minor figurative density in opener ("sigh of stale air") without muddle, varied syntax propels to chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech/ghostseer probing circus ceilings via dust-horology yields inevitable photo revelation; risk in non-verbal ghost plea heightens ingenuity.</comment>
