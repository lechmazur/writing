<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's diligently curious nature drives consistent micro-choices like sketching shadows and cross-referencing glyphs, embodied in her quickened pulse and whispered translations. Interiority feels particular through cartographer's reverence for echoes and logbooks. No deep flaws or contradictory impulses complicate her path, keeping it idealized without genuine struggle, but change to "keeper of light" earns via prior effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns in starlings, shadows, glyphs, and phrasebook build density to DC closure when pressing squares reveals orb. Orientation anchors early in airship vigil. One tightening via shadow sequence matching verse creates legible before/after with felt cost in her sustained isolation; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains climax choice, dust glyphs charge discovery; starling shadows and teak deck evolve tactilely through action. Sensory hierarchy fits POV: visual patterns prioritized amid "distant wings." Airship conduits hum and balloons swell mirror internal restoration, integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore ship via discovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through pattern cross-referencing narrowing to square sequence. Agency in noting and pressing forecloses failed vigil path with emotional cost (tears). No reversals needed; pressure coheres to charged final hum, though smooth resolution mutes visceral price slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of kindred spirits' quiet maps emerges organically from phrasebook marginalia and final notation reweighting isolation as embrace. Starling spiral callbacks prior murmuration without moralizing. Resonance in orb's warmth answers discovery question non-literally, though triumphant arc leans sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with cartographer's perceptual bias: "language written in shadow and wingbeat." Voice texture modulates from hushed reverence to resonant hum, syntax rhythmic without monotony. Elevated diction ("cerulean silence") fits fantasy idiom consistently; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer sensory propulsion like "amber light bled across the horizon." Rhythms vary for ear, openings diverse. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("stranded luminance both literal and metaphorical") risks muddle but doesn't obscure closure; ignore bracketed counts per policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Starling shadows on hopscotch unlocking aether-orb synthesizes fresh puzzle from airship tropes, inevitable via glyph-phrasebook buildup. Risky lyric pattern of whispers and dances heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Transformation test passes: specifics like square sequence defy swap.</comment>
