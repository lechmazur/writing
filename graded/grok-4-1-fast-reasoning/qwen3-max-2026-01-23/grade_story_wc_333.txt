<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through actions like untying the ribbon, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; competent execution without deep internal struggle or blind spots compounding pressure earns strong but not exceptional score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("luminescent essence rose... seed of grace cast into the cosmos") where cost is legible in fear's recoil and hair dulling; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent, persistent celestial constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keystone fracture and Vega's light constrain pivotal choice and charge final image of transformation; sensory details selective (whispering oaks, silk whisper) mirror internal release without overt symbolism, spatial choreography precise throughout nexus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate trapped idea) tightens via star-revealed fracture forcing tender disorientation over force; agency in pressing hair forecloses violent path with felt cost in shadows writhing, coherent escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love transcending fear's prison emerges organically from particulars like enveloped secrets dissolving; final image of essence ascending offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing, inviting lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of empathetic mysticism; rhythmic modulation supports pressure, diction purposeful though occasionally elevated, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in descriptive peaks ("shadowed nexus... cosmic possibility") risks figurative density without full pattern payoff; no loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphysical locksmith premise synthesizes empathy/tools into indispensable turns; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens cosmic stakes organically, transforming lockpicking trope through lived tenderness.</comment>
