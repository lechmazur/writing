<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's warmly attentive stillness enables concrete micro-choices like using the feather as quill, revealing hierarchy of values; interiority particular in perceiving ripple-erased shadows. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, keeping it from exceptional. Final offering of kite shows earned renunciation with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from kite snap (*twang*) to feather discovery and writing, culminating in CR closure where star in "beautifully incomplete sky" reconfigures incomplete as resilient beauty with acceptance cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via unplanned grace suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Feather's "vanes shifting from lagoon-cobalt to ember-copper" constrains choice as quill and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (sight-touch in warmth up arm) reflects poet's bias. Setting evolves causally from post-rain polish to indigo dusk, mirroring internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, deepens via feather's "paradox of delicate strength" narrowing to write rather than lament; agency in tending snap into verse forecloses pity with child's sorrow cost. Textural escalation coherent, one cadence shift sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: snap-feather-writing reweights discord as "renewal’s canvas," final star offers non-literal answer to woven dawns without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "string surrenders...to teach the kite the wind’s true name."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in reverent fracture-seeing; rhythmic control modulates from hush to deepening indigo, prose syntax mirrors poet's harmonizing mind. No head-hopping or withholding; elision purposeful in myth-echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with lines like "light mended night’s fractures thread by fragile thread" advancing image+momentum; rhythm varies read-aloud. Figurative density pattern-taught early pays off in closure without muddle, minor repetition of "harmonizing" purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic drake feather into poet's method transforms kite-loss trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable "lightning’s echo." Inevitable hindsight from "woven dawns" premise.</comment>
