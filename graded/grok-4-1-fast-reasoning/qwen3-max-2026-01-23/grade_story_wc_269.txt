<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tapping density builds to revelation; on-page Charged Poise closure via AI visualization reconfigures "drifting moored" with conceptual cost of ecological silence's primacy, cost legible in "Tears streamed... understanding."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tapping as biometric/ecological cartography transforms climate grief trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens remembrance stakes, inevitable in hindsight via rhythm patterns.</comment>
