<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to witness transformation rooted in traits like loose grip on reality drives serene endurance; embodied perception shines in burrowing descent ("cool clay against skin"). Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ test; no pivotal flawed choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of decay/growth images builds to CR closure via sapling and inscription reweighting permanence with conceptual cost of embracing flux. Orientation anchored early ("overgrown library tended by Elara"); tremor-to-return tightening coheres one dominant stake. No causality breaks; journey ellipsis motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Environment (catacombs, refuge) constrains choices like burrowing and charges final sapling image; sensory details ("wet paper and loam," "phosphorescent flow") selective via POV bias. Micro-object swan as setting enables passage; evolved details (moss stitching flagstones) mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness change) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via river cracks and return to sapling; agency in unfolding swan forecloses stasis paths with felt surrender cost. Quiet pressure coheres under lens; one tightening (tremor) narrows to observation endurance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation's peace emerges organically from particulars like fern-sprouting encyclopedias and inscription; final image ("sapling oak... leaves trembling") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting decay/growth. Subtext in silence honors ambiguity without moralizing; no Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (loose-reality whispers as tangible); rhythmic prose ("slow song," "gentle tide") modulates serenely, diction biased to regenerative motifs. No elision withholding; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at charged poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mushrooms blooming in forgotten armchairs" advances setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor overwrite in repeated "regenerative silence" phrasing, but pattern-taught without closure muddle; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living library and origami-burrow transforms tropes via specific loose-reality logic; risk in lyric fantasy heightens thematic stakes. Swan folds as ingenious turn grows from particulars; no derivative echoes, inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
