<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's interiority shines in "felt the weight of generations," embodying grief-wonder fusion; Lyra's arc from doubt to "poised understanding" earned via tracing. Minor label-speak ("balancedly curious resolve") slightly abstracts traits without full embodiment cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chain demo to holotank bloom, culminating in Charged Poise RR at Lyra's "I feel oriented" with generational cost felt in Kael's lighter heart. Orientation anchored early; closure cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Benthic city's "bioluminescent pathways pulsed... against eternal twilight" and crystalflex viewport constrain starless navigation, charging chain link's reprise; holotank integrates tactilely via scanner. Micro-setting (chain) shapes choices, mirroring internal expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (perception expansion vs. buried doubt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Lyra's trace succeeding in holotank; agency in guiding hand, cost in "arduous path to surface" felt. Minor abstractness in stakes before demo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of stitching starlight into spirit emerges via chain-star overlay, reweighted non-literally in "new starlight... within the human heart." Avoids moralizing until subtle final murmur; resonance from particulars like 78-degree angle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Kael with perceptual bias ("ocean’s lethal grace"); dialogue natural/subtextual (Lyra's doubt yields to vow-like hold). Rhythmic control modulates to hushed awe; minor convergence in student whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("unfolded horizons," "somber marvel") in final third dull closure image, with paraphrase churn (multiple hope/expansion restatements); syntax varies but elevated diction drifts in peak ("cognitive expansion"). Density high elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of drowned world, alien star-wisdom, and rusted chain as geometric key transforms tropes; irreplaceable premise shines in holotank match of "seventy-eight-degree angle perfectly bridging Merak and Dubhe."</comment>
