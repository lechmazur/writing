<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Collective family unity shows as resilient unit under blight pressure, with Kael's skepticism ("That rusted relic?") warring memory to compel action; individuals archetypal (pragmatic engineer, intuitive botanist), lacking deeper contradictory impulses in pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: messages build pattern to bell discovery and ritual tightening; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page in "A silent chime vibrated...blight blackened," reweighting orchard/family with ghost's departure cost ("My watch ends").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain mirror placement ("scaled the floating arches with ropes"), charging final beam path; verdigris carvings and mossy pedestal evolve tactilely through goal-directed action, mirroring internal persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Blights orchard/family survival stake signaled early, tightens via reexamination revealing "harmonic key" and nebula alignment, forcing collective trade-off (heights risk for mirrors); cost legible in ghost's felt loss at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Brambled hope theme emerges from shared tending to final "nebula blazed...celestial benediction"; Elara's whisper ("Strangers become family...") borders thematic echo but anchors in her departure image without replacing pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person collective POV stable, perceptual bias toward orchard patterns ("spiraling apple...impossible hues"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Kael's "How do we aim the light?" pursues goal), rhythmic control heightens dusk tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("A beam of liquid-silver light lanced down"), metaphors purposeful (brambled hope motif taught early); minor overwrite in opening descriptors but no loops touching purification climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-oracle in low-grav orchard with nebula harmonic ritual transforms tropes; floating arches/nebula alignment risk heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via chalk pattern.</comment>
