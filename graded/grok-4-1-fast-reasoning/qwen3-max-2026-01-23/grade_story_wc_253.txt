<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the ritual narration shielding the void while carving reveals vulnerability; final softening and tear earn change through prior causality. Splinter-prick moment embodies moral ambiguity with felt cost, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shavings/memories densify to bird placement as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting grief with tear as legible cost. Turbine shadow sweep in final line charges before/after. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via blood-prayer suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turbines' hum and shadows constrain ritual perception and charge final image, mirroring internal alchemy; dust motes and knife curls tactilely lived-in. Sensory hierarchy reflects grief-narrowed focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through carving/memory integration to stance crystallization; agency in endurance forecloses mask with tear-cost. One tightening via splinter narrows to prayer, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remade hush emerges from ritual particulars, final breath/image resonantly reweights Mandate's force into chosen quiet without moral. Bouquet-bird synthesis ties ambiguity organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with theatrical perceptual signature (dramatic narration as internal voice); rhythmic modulation peaks in softening whisper. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors cohere (turbines "carving sky," shavings as memories) without muddle in peak blood-tear beat. Varied rhythm, no loops; minor figurative density in opener contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Mandate dystopia, whittling ritual, turbine alchemy transforms grief tropes; risk in solo accumulative drive heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
