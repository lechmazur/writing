<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to inscribe the verse intensifies through her tide-dancer intuition during the ritual, earning her release from exile with felt cost. Kael's awe and resolve show embodied change without stock phrasing. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than shown acting simultaneously in pivotal inscription beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from observation to inscription, delivering Charged Poise closure when "the spontaneous anchor... dissolved into gentle, purposeful release"—cost legible in exile's end. Orientation anchored early in garden under stars. Single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's stars and gaps constrain inscription choices, charging final image of Elara watching Kael through the archway. Sensory details like jasmine, dew, and breeze filter through Elara's perceptual bias, evolving with ritual. No white-room; micro-setting as lived crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of midwifing Kael's fledge tightens via inscription deepening under Accumulative lens, narrowing Elara's anchor with moonstone's consumption. Agency in her precise glyphs forces trade-off of relic for resolve. Cost unmistakable in dissolving anchor and Kael's departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inscribed defiance against the ban emerges organically from ritual glyphs and final realization: ban "possessed no power over a future inscribed on willing skin." Resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity in choice-based freedom lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with distinct poetic texture: syntax flows like "obsidian grace," modulating rhythm in inscription peak. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden: "This verse is not memory... a compass." Perceptual signature in gap-observations biases vividly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm matching ritual's build; openings diversify without monotony. Figurative language dense in inscription ("sweeping crescent curve") but pattern-taught poetic, no muddle. Minor overwrite in star-gap metaphors slightly blurs peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide-dancing tattoos from star gaps defies memory ban organically. Risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens cosmic defiance stakes. Final Elara "rising on thermals of purpose" feels inevitable, transforming exile trope boldly.</comment>
