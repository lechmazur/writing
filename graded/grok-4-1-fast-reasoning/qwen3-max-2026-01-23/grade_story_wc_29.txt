<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in celestial expertise drives micro-choices like bypassing filters, with embodied resolve ("resolve settled in his bones"); minor slips in label-speak ("ethereal grit") feel diagnostic without full embodiment, slightly undercutting peak tears moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as signal density builds to pattern break at broadcast success ("jagged scar...softening"); Charged Poise closure lands on-page with cost ("tricksters would adapt...face Croft’s wrath"), oriented early via basement sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station console, charts, and quad window constrain choices (hijack transmitter, view calming) and charge final image ("hand rested on...chart"); sensory hierarchy (subsonic thrum, oscilloscope glow) filters through Aris's perceptual bias effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit tricksters) signaled early tightens via pulsar alignment to agency-driven interference, foreclosing compliance path; cost legible in Croft's footsteps and adaptive foes, though Dean's memo feels slightly declared over tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of resonance over force emerges organically from frequency warfare to final "precise, compassionate interference"; resonant non-literal close reweights cosmic game, but "ethereal grit" fusion borders overt articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (frequencies as "whispers," "silent scream"); rhythmic control modulates urgency without head-hopping, elevated diction consistent with interpreter's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor paraphrase loops ("cautiously hopeful" reprises thrice) and figurative density ("flowers after drought") slightly dull peak oscilloscope beat without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subsonic cosmic manipulation via quasar harmonic transforms radio trope ingeniously; risk in quiet victory amid looming wrath heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from charts' marginalia.</comment>
