<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and endurance in final wiring act, with gnarled hands and slowing breath revealing character under mortality's pressure; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, muting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through daily rituals to Charged Poise closure at "deep chime resonated... marrow," reconfiguring orchard's silence with Kael's felt life-cost; orientation anchored immediately, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "hidden groove" in pillars constrain wiring choices and charge final warmth image; sensory hierarchy (hum, click, shiver) reflects botanical POV perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore covenant before death) tightens accumulatively via orchard responses, culminating in agency-driven final connection; cost legible in "breath grew shallow" and marrow chime, though no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies reciprocity emerges organically from copper threads and final acorn drop, reweighting death as seed without moralizing; resonant non-literal closure image avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (botanical whispers, stone sighs); rhythmic control heightens ritual beats, prose texture reverent yet precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in ending affirmations ("stone remembered. Oak responded," etc.) slightly dull cadence; closure image clear, rhythm varies naturally elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical architecture and dying restoration transforms tropes into inevitable copper-veined covenant; risk in lyric compression pays off at humming pillars.</comment>
