<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in choosing pain over illusion culminate in earned renunciation of the mercury glass (290), revealing values hierarchy with embodied cost; interiority particular via textures and ancestral gifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as textured memory seeding builds to CR closure via stone's message (237) reweighting exile with pain cost (190); single scene oriented early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore constrains discovery (81) and charges final image as evolving cradle (314); tactile details like stone veins and feather barbules mirror internal shift purposefully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of internal home emerges implicitly from seeding struggle to resonant CR image (237, 251) reweighting prior motifs without moralizing; ambiguity in "shape" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
