<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's acoustically perceptive trait roots motivation in embodied sensitivity, shown via expanding awareness of "drip of condensation, a root's sigh"; micro-choices like inverting bowl compel higher stakes. Interior contradiction emerges in exquisite pain of silence versus deliberate seeding of sound. Earned change: tears of awe after arm aches, foreclosing restoration for unfinished beauty. Minor epiphanic tidy-up in "she understood unbind" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from silence to resonant note weaving hush into "golden thread," culminating in Charged Poise RR where hush becomes "companion holding space." Orientation anchored early ("sunken orchard greenhouse"). One tightening: breeze stirs ash, shoot trembles, reweighting stake with fatigue cost ("arm ached with beautiful fatigue"). Closure cost legible in bowl's final tremor and leaving it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy acoustic-POV biased: "note reflected off curved glass, echoed within shipwreck ribs." Setting constrains: bowl as resonator, broken panes frame twilight. Final image charged by stars through glass, shipwrecks as witnesses. Purposeful selection mirrors internal shift, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind beauty in silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via note amplification to "Ember Song" nourishing shoot, narrowing void into canvas. Agency: bow on violin-over-bowl forecloses reversal path. Cost unmistakable: "arm ached," tears trace ash. 8.8+ gate met by felt price charging hush reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (unbind potential from despair) emerges organically via particulars: grandfather's memory tilts present playing, final image reprices silence as "pregnant with possibility." Resonant non-literal answer in bowl's tremor echoing unfinished stories. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in invitation to others. Protagonist arc inextricable from seeking beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with acoustic perceptual signature: "acoustically perceptive awareness expanding." Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, prose texture distinct in sonic imagery ("vibrating through stone and bone"). No head-hopping; elision of backstory cued concretely pays off in song choice. Under stress, diction compresses purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, propulsion strong in playing sequence; info density high ("jagged glass refracting light, stubborn apple sapling"). Overwriting drag: figurative density ("velvety blanket," "golden thread," "dancing like forgotten memories") in most descriptive beats without pattern payoff subtracts −0.6. Minor paraphrase on hush repetition purposeful under lens. No loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: violin-on-mendicant-bowl resonator in shipwreck-ringed greenhouse transforms post-fire tropes via acoustic hush. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Turn inevitable: silence yields to unfinished co-existence. Non-obvious angle on renewal elevates.</comment>
