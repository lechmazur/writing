<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's operatively gentle trait constrains reactions like meeting the elder's glare without recoil, building to the earned resignation with embodied tremor; contradictory impulses in calm facade vs. soul tremor act in the confession beat. Redemption motivation roots choices with visible cost in stepping aside. Final choice forecloses commander's shadow with relational price on former enemies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from approach to confession reversal, signing pattern break, to CR closure in resignation walk-away reweighting redemption as absence; cost legible in "path ahead... not paved with ash." Single scene causality tight, orientation anchored in first paragraph terrace/midsummer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sun-bleached limestone, heat waves, aligned moons filter through Kaelen's priorities, constraining ritual on hallowed terrace; clipboard as recurring micro-setting charges altar placement in closure image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to clipboard edge-tracing under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant redemption/peace stake signaled early, tightens via confession narrowing trust options, agency in public admission/resignation foreclosing personal role with felt relational cost; under Accum lens, cadence shift to signing reweights opposition. One deepening sufficient, charges flawed peace image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flawed beauty/price of redemption emerges organically from confession wound-to-anchor shift and final terrace-holding image, offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing; subtext in hesitant nods reweights ideals-in-practice. Complexity lingers in lingering distrust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in gentle phrasing like "prayer on stone"; dialogue subtext-driven (elder's unclenching fist), natural rhythm distinguishes voices. Rhythmic control heightens confession pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric figurative language ("dark flowers on parchment") consistent and pattern-taught early, no loops/artifacts; varied syntax propels from setup to charged final image. Zero scaffold, rhythm modulates with moonrise peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms negotiator trope via self-sabotage resignation as redemption anchor; confession on hallowed ground risks bold power shift. Non-obvious moral calculus elevates familiarity without derivative hedging.</comment>
