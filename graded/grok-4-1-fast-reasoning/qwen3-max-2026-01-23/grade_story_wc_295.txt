<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied fatigue ("fatigue weighed heavy") and contradictory isolation yielding to connection via micro-choice to peer again; final change earned with tears as cost. Minor therapy-speak slip in "profound peace settled" but embodied overall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from glyph-tracing to telegram pivot to Mira observation, landing CR closure ("weight dissolved into connection") with emotional cost legible in tears and steadied heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory micro-setting constrains via telescope for pivotal witnessing; scents (aged paper, brass) and star-dusted sky charge solitude-to-chorus arc, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode amid isolation) tightens via telegram-deepening under Accumulative lens, forcing renunciation of solitude with felt cost in frayed spirit healing; agency in final peer-through forecloses solo burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges organically from star metaphor and telegram reprise, resonant CR in inscribed words ("We hold the light so you may close your eyes") reweighting isolation without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (celestial glyphs, pulsing stars); rhythmic diction modulates from heavy fatigue to dawn gilding, minimal dialogue natural and pressure-applying.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("Mira at its deepest dim—a humble, necessary pause"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor figurative density in closure but purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreams, variable stars, and daylily as fleeting vigilance transforms isolation trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via glyph-star harmony.</comment>
