<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preserving murals and accepting impermanence act through tactile exploration; coin-tracing epiphany is embodied and earned with visible cost of abandonment. Face blindness uniquely roots motivation in texture over sight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure; coin discovery reconfigures limits premise with felt cost of murals' loss in final crack. Orientation anchored early in tree library.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tree trunk's bark shelves and damp wood constrain tactile search and charge coin as micro-setting; fractal coin in final pocket image ties environment to realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to mirror sky tightens via coin's infinite regress narrowing frustration into acceptance; agency in tracing forces renunciation with demolition cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fractal coin reweights sky-mirroring premise non-literally in palm-held cosmos; emergent theme of limits as vessels avoids moralizing, resonating through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tactile perceptual signature ("thumb, calloused from brushwork") biases noticing consistently; rhythmic compression heightens stillness to revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("dust motes drifted like forgotten stars"); no loops, varied rhythm varies with pressure to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face-blind fractals on coin synthesize fresh infinity-in-limits angle; bold tactile lyricism risks and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
