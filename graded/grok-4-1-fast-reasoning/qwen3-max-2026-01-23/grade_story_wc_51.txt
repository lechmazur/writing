<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction between her childhood abandonment fear and merchant compassion acts simultaneously in the whalebone reverie, fueling the final weave arc and earning her endurance against personal solitude. Micro-choices like thread adjustment reveal values hierarchy. Flawless embodiment avoids labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hush to weave intensification to calcification RR (obsidian sculpture placement), with felt cost in Elara's mirrored "boundary-lessly trapped existence." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no disorientation debt. Persistent shuttle constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and whalebone shuttle constrain ritual choices (cool floor, familiar curves guide hands), charging final image of shelf burdens and extinguished lamp. Sensory hierarchy (drips, sighs, lamplight bend) reflects Elara's priorities. Starlight continuity recharges renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (calcify anxiety) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via resistance, thread reorientation, granulation tightening density with agency-driven deepening. Cost legible in patience permeation and her solitude mirror. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of burden transformation vs personal calcification emerges organically from weave particulars, answered non-literally in final flexibility refusal amid "keeper and kept." Shelf of weights recharges motif without moralizing. Complexity lingers in her solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (fractal patterns, hush layers) biased to weaver's empathy. Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity (short breaths at adjustment). No elision or head-hopping; diction purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (advance weave, embody emotion). Rhythmic variety (long hush descriptions to sharp "distant bell"). Zero loops/artifacts; figurative coherence (nautilus spiral mirrors anxiety paths) in peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-weaving alchemy synthesizes ritual fantasy organically; "orienting properly" calculus transforms trope. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
