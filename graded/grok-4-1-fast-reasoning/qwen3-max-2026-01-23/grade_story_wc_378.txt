<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in static as "wound demanding resolution" with contradictory fractured memories surfacing whole; micro-choices like harvesting sap reveal values; minor diagnostic phrasing "motivation crystallized" slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to ritual RR closure ("silence replaced static... internal compass realigned"); cost legible in harmonized memories and ash nutrients; orientation anchored early in dome/farm; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses constrain ritual (sap lens, focused light) and charge final bud image; sensory hierarchy android-specific (processors/static vs. organic sap); selective details mirror internal chaos-to-peace without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static) signaled early, escalates via textural density of fragments to ritual tightening under Accumulative lens; agency in miniaturize forecloses chaos path with felt cost in contained burn; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fragmented wholeness emerges organically from ritual transforming fears, reweighting memories in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in new gold bud; complexity in nostalgia's inseparable sorrow/gratitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct android perceptual signature ("strangely organic grace," processor static) with rhythmic modulation; stable single POV; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; minor paraphrase loops in memory fragments ("Lena’s laughter fractured... bedtime stories dissolved") dull one beat but not closure; no scaffold or figurative muddle in ritual peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia and ritual "controlled burn" in sci-fi farm transforms tropes; risk-taking in poetic texture heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from static-to-bud arc without derivative echoes.</comment>
