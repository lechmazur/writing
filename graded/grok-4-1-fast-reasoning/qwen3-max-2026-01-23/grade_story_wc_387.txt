<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to appreciate hidden effort drives meditative actions like mending and whistling, embodied in gnarled fingers and tea ritual. Interiority concrete via observations but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphanies feel declarative rather than earned through struggle. Final endurance of philosophy credible but low-stakes without visible cost on pivotal whistle beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from net-mending to firefly helix via pattern emergence, culminating in CR closure ("Hidden effort is never truly hidden") with transience cost felt in final images. Orientation anchored early (~first paragraph). Single scene coherent; whistle micro-turn tightens without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (petrichor, emerald foam, obsidian river) filter through philosopher's priorities, constraining tea preparation on damp ledge. Recurring wet stones and moonlight charge final net image, mirroring internal appreciation. No generic placeholders; spatial choreography clear throughout descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening observations (net→whisk→fireflies), narrowing to demure audacity post-whistle. One tightening (firefly reorganization) forces stance crystallization with transience cost legible in "poignant transience." Pressure coherent under lens; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort/patterns emerges organically from net, whisk, fireflies; final CR reweights via demure audacity without moralizing. Resonance in moon paths reprise, but late reflections ("his philosophy crystallized") verge on thematic echo, reducing subtlety at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: meditative bias toward patterns in "miniature galaxies in emerald foam." Rhythmic prose modulates from precise mending to lyrical firefly helix; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but final third paraphrase loops ("hidden effort," "patterns," "demure audacity") across reflections create −0.6 artifact drag dulling closure image. Minor metaphor density in firefly beats coherent, not overwriting. Clean syntax, strong verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms net-mending, tea whisk, firefly moon paths into philosophy of hidden effort; whistle helix turn feels inevitable from established patterns. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative tropes or hedging.</comment>
