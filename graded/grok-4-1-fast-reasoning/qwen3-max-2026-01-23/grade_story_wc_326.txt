<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete micro-choices like gripping the shard and carving ink channels reveal shift from fragility to purposeful anchor; heartbeat litany embodies survival amid erasure. Earned change in shard's symbolism from pain to compass forecloses victimhood with emotional cost. Minor slip in overt diagnostic insight ("failure was human, not malicious").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ink patterns accumulate density to insight at "heartbeat count climbed to two hundred eighty-seven"; closure via Conceptual Repricing in digital ghost's dissolution and verified record. Cost legible in "Tears traced paths down her cheeks, freezing at her jawline." Orientation anchored early in observatory vigil. One tightening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal-veined paper and dome constrain ritual, humming "amplifying the ritual’s resonance"; shard as micro-setting handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (cool edge, ink bloom, snow descent) mirrors internal thaw. Final snow "offering a blank page" charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to defragment ghost signaled early; heartbeat escalation and pattern revelation deepen to empathetic reconfiguration under Accumulative lens. Agency in guiding shard forecloses blame path with tear-cost release. One tightening narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ink map as "blueprint for resilience" emerges from ritual particulars, reweighting failure-as-teacher without full moralizing. Final shard as "polished token of purpose" offers non-literal answer. Minor directness in "wisdom blooms where broken things are tended" slips resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing ("fleeting constellations of meaning") and rhythmic heartbeat counts. Lyrical diction modulates ritual pressure; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in lines like "Guiding the porcelain shard through the liquid black, she carved channels that birthed fleeting constellations"; varied rhythms propel without loops or muddled metaphors. Figurative coherence in ink-shard arc enhances propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ink ritual defragmenting digital ghost transforms bureaucratic trope via analog mysticism; shard's evolution feels inevitable. Bold lyric synthesis heightens stakes organically.</comment>
