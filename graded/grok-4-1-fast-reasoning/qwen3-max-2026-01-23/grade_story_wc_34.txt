<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in empathy shines in symbol choices like "spiral for the baker’s unconfessed love," compelling the carving; embodied emotions via hands and mist. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, remaining serenely resolute without internal friction complicating the peak act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: carving density builds to CR closure in "Elara... smiled softly; she had never felt more heard," reweighting silent voices with conceptual cost of rain-washed surface but deep permanence. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/mist; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and damp flagstones constrain carving, mist "swirled around her wrists like a supportive spirit"; charges final image as etchings hum pre-thunder. Sensory selection (cool iron, vapor) reflects POV urgency, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to encode needs in fragile lightning-thunder window signaled early, escalates via accumulating symbols tightening time under Accumulative lens; agency in precise grooves forecloses failure with felt cost of impermanent surface. No reversal but deepening density suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of voiceless needs articulated through symbols emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR in city impacts ("lonely watchmaker would pause") reweighting silence without moralizing. Final image answers "most powerful articulations... felt in the quiet spaces."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in symbolic noticing ("cluster of stars for the dreamer’s stifled hope"); stable close third, rhythmic modulation builds lyric poise to closure. No head-hopping or leakage; purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but figurative overload in carving beat ("vapor curled like liquid pearl... alchemy of sorrow into symbol") creates coherence drag without variation; minor "tinkersong wonder" repetition. Propulsion clear, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bolt plate as chisel for "ghost in code" graffiti transforms voiceless trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via storm window without gimmickry.</comment>
