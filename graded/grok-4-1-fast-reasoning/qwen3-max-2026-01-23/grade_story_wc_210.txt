<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between nostalgia and resolve act in the memory-weaving scene, earning the final architect transformation with solitude's visible cost; interiority particular via sensory threads like pine resin and net-mending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density builds to crystallized blueprint (DC/CR); closure lands on-page with bottle-planting as vow, cost legible in rejecting magic's false opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Derelict quay, lanterns, and plaza post constrain revival choices and charge final soil-planting image; sensory details like salt wind and rice-paper thump filter through Elara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skill-based revival vs nostalgia) tightens via memory crucible deepening knowledge; agency in conception forecloses magic path, cost felt in "quiet ferocity" and generational horizon charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-made-manifest emerges organically from bottle's wholeness and lantern echoes shifting to craft rituals; final image of planted seed offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in alchemical bias (e.g., "mental crucible"); rhythmic texture modulates from reflective breath to purposeful strokes, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor figurative density in opening fits taught lyric pattern without muddling closure's clean planting image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemist rejecting magic for memory-driven revival; risk in purely reflective "action" (conception via threads) heightens stakes through irreplaceable bottle constraint.</comment>
