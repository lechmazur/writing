<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied nostalgia (driftwood wash, tears freezing) driving micro-choices like tool selection; final realization earned by prior ache and repair causality, showing contradictory longing/fulfillment in the hall's clarity moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building light/gear patterns to CR closure (hum resonates, nostalgia transforms with emotional cost in tears); orientation anchored early (library above clouds by para 1); prophecy path causal without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via ice-domed light revealing gear flaws during uncapping, charging final mirror-dance image; selective sensory (frost-veined shelves, crystalline air) mirrors internal states through POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn repair rhythm) deepens accumulatively when light shows wear patterns, forcing reharmonizing choice with emotional cost (ache to fulfillment); agency in deliberate uncapping tightens under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (rhythm as honoring, not fixing) emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR in final whisper reweighting nostalgia without moralizing; "gentle apology" motif shifts via repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (gear-as-heartbeat, light symphony); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, prose-as-character reflects locksmith's patient cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short tap-twist sentences in repair beat); no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors cohere (light fracturing reveals); minor figurative density in opener purposeful for lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith quest in celestial frozen library transforms tropes via light-as-revelation; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure inevitability.</comment>
