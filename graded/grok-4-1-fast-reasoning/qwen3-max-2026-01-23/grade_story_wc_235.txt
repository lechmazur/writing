<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in embodied jealousy ("hot, corrosive") and micro-choice to dissolve boundaries, earning release; minor diagnostic labels like "feral nostalgia" slightly abstract impulses without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening from grave-memory to dream echoes to scroll inscription; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with legible emotional cost in tear and "fragile, resilient peace."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll and pine table grooves recur to constrain writing/dream choices and charge final reroll image; sensory selectivity (woodsmoke hollow, wind rush) mirrors chronological chaos without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill terror) signaled early, escalates via jealousy surge narrowing to wonder under Accumulative lens; one tightening (past selves' wave) forces trade-off with felt cost in softened pain, charging fragile peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of life's narrative as soaring emerges organically from dream images and scroll words, reweighting grave premise in final dawn image; scroll phrasing borders thematic echo but earns through dream causality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with chronicler-biased perception (time malleability, dream mapping); rhythmic prose modulates from dissonance to poise, no head-hopping, distinct texture in syntax under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (hand arcs line in sleep), varied rhythm propels; minor overwriting in metaphors ("minutes bled," "discarded quiver") accumulates without muddling closure, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grave shock, dream jealousy of selves, auto-written wisdom transforms time trope; risk in nonlinear dream-shard heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via scroll payoff.</comment>
