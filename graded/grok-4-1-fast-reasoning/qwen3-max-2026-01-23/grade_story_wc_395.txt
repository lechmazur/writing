<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to guardianship, with micro-choices like lying to the assistant earning the final renunciation; interiority embodied in tears and breath, though "brightly attentive" borders on label-only without deeper tradeoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (numbers, songs) builds to Psi discovery; CR closure reconfigures absences as sacred with legible cost in log-wiping and burden-as-purpose; orientation anchored early (Elara in archive).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Patch as micro-setting constrains unlocking and charges final image as "compass/key/covenant"; sensory details like "filtered oxygen and old secrets" integrate purposefully through POV bias toward data echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover deleted files) tightens accumulatively via numbers-to-Psi; lie forecloses reporting with guardianship cost felt in "weight was not burden, but purpose"; agency drives without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of intentional absences emerges organically from particulars (deleted sanctuary, sensed protection); final image of "sacred space between" offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in data "echoes" and "whispers"; voice rhythmic and biased toward patterns; minimal dialogue (Vance/Lena) natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varying rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in final reflections ("absences," "echoes") dull closure image slightly without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh digital "sanctuary" reimagines cold case via pattern-hunting in archives; transforms tropes through lived data curation and Psi reveal growing inevitably from particulars.</comment>
