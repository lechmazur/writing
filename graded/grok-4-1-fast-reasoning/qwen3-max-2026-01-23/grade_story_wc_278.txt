<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in the niece's cry translation, embodying guilt as contradictory exhaustion versus withheld response, compelling the hum with visible emotional cost. Interiority particular via tattooist hands trembling over console. Final pocketed amber marks earned reconfiguration without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cries, guilt, time shards builds to RR closure in chime and hush, with cost legible in "guilt’s sharp edges... hushed, softened." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; visionary shards taught early, converge legibly. No causality breaks touch climax hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lab's "lost sounds," reverse clocks, ozone constrain tether action; amber as micro-setting charges final image, cooling post-reconciliation. Sensory hierarchy (tactile ink-fingers, sonic wails) reflects tattooist POV bias. Time chaos guides choices without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt-dissonance) signaled early, deepens texturally when cry matches niece's, forcing hum agency under lens; forecloses dismissal path with remorse cost. Escalation via translation narrows to precise sonic response, charging final chime image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of universal cries needing translation emerges organically from amber-wasp, letters, visions; final "I hear you" reconfigures guilt to "guiding star" without statement. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, lingering in peace constellation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third, perceptual signature via stellar mapping and sonic landscapes; rhythm modulates from chaotic loops to hush cadence. Compression in visions purposeful, taught early, legible at closure; no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring time folds; "tapestry of time" integrates action. Minor overwrite in triple "She saw" visions dulls propulsion slightly (−0.4), but closure image clear, no loops touch chime. Rhythmic hush lands potently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of cry-translation attribute, prehistoric amber, firmware haunt transforms tropes into inevitable convergence; risk in nonlinear visions heightens stakes without gimmick. Wasp as witness across millennia feels fresh, organic to closure.</comment>
