<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied sensations like the gear's vibration; internal shift from fear to trust earned via journey beats. Minor therapy-speak in epiphanies ("organized potential") borders unearned, but doesn't undermine closure change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to gear placement as CR, with cost legible in "old anxieties unravel like loosened threads" and final peace. Orientation anchored early; single tightening via auditory map suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting integrates purposefully—wind through copper pines and iron willows guides choice, constraining path to obsidian tree. Gear as micro-setting charges final image; sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mind's frontier rediscovery) tightens accumulatively via insight hum and map; agency in listening/placing forecloses fear path with felt cost in unraveled anxieties. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of alignment-through-unraveling emerges organically from gear click and wind-song; final image ("hum... steady rhythm of his heart") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Borderline explicitness in "probable miracles... natural blossoming" slightly dilutes subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: mechanical-organic fusion in phrasing like "ticking ferns and steam-hissed rivers." Rhythmic modulation heightens insight beats; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm suits lyric accumulative mode. Minor paraphrase loops ("closed his eyes, listening" recurs) and "unravel" churn don't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical rainforest and inward journey transforms quest trope; translocation attribute and gear reunion feel inevitable, risk-taking in textural drive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
