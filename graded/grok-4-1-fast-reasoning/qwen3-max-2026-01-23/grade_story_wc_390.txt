<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's logically emotional trait drives concrete micro-choices like filing the key's tine, blending engineer's precision with empathetic intuition during strikes. Embodied emotions (pressure behind eyes, tightening chest) reveal internal contradiction without labels in peak beats. Final fulfillment feels earned via iterative struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through iterative strikes toward RR closure in "its light steadied into unwavering gold, its hum settling," reconfiguring dissonance to harmony with felt cost of adaptation. Orientation anchors early (pier, marina, sunset). Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (salt-bleached coat, frost-thick air, Chime's whine) filter through Elara's priorities, constraining choices (ice floor kneel, stone altar strike). Environment charges final image: serene marina under starlight mirrors internal peace. No white-room; choreography tracks descent cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Chime) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via strike refinements narrowing tonal options, forcing agency in microscopic adjustments. Cost legible in physical/emotional strain ("jagged vibration tightening her chest"); convergence at harmony reweights pressure. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges organically from iterative repair, balancing flesh/spirit without statement; final image ("harmony woven would echo long after stars faded") offers non-literal resonant answer to dissonance/forgiveness. Particulars (key strikes, Chime glow) avoid platitudes. Ambiguity lingers in sacred silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: engineer's geometric mapping + empathetic resonance shapes noticing (ice fractures, harmonic rejection). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (short "Strike, listen, refine" under stress). No head-hopping; elision purposeful in descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm, but figurative density ("liquid silver," "forgiveness woven from sound") in peak crypt beats borders overwriting without obscuring closure. Minimal loops; strong verbs anchor action. Read-aloud ear flows with purposeful cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sonic absolution premise ingeniously transforms lighthouse trope into vibrational healing, with key's star-iron tuning feeling inevitable from bloodline duty. Risky ethereal tone heightens stakes organically; no template echoes. Fresh synthesis of logic/emotion in crisis.</comment>
