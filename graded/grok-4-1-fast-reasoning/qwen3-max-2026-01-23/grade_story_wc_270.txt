<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong insurgent grandmother with contradictory impulses (passive tradition vs. active reconstruction) driving the pivotal unsealing choice; embodied tears and scoff at "Elder scrolls" vindicate her arc with felt cost. Interiority particular via plant-telepathy specifics. Minor backstory summary early anchors without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: kite glyph → pine urge → amber find → unseal (DC) with "soft crack" as legible before/after reconfiguration; cost in breaking "broken constraints." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs constrain choices (submerge in hottest pool, moss crevice search) and charge closure via "roots anchored deep into volcanic stone"; sensory selectivity (sulfur bite, steam plumes) reflects Elara's priorities. Pine and pools evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition actively) signaled early, tightens causally at decoding to unseal under Causal lens, foreclosing passive path with "scoffed softly" agency. Cost legible in "tears... vindication." Minor abstract declaration before pivotal crack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges from unseal action and Silvershade growth mirroring "amber light"; final image reweights tradition without moralizing. Pine's "*honored the seal's deepest intent*" offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (plant-telepathy ripples); voice rhythmic and biased toward renewal motifs. Kaela's dialogue natural/subtextual, distinct idiom. Minor filter in "sensed the resin softening" but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to unseal climax; purposeful lyricism (bubbles "dance like joyful spirits") without muddle. Minor paraphrase near end ("gratitude flooded... singing renewal") but no closure dull. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant-telepathy, insurgent elder, amber embryo transforms destiny trope; kite script turn inevitable from glyphs. Risky lyric causality heightens stakes organically.</comment>
