<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied doubt "cold as the lake’s surface" dissolving into bone-deep certainty; contradictory impulses act via mental retracing under data pressure. Minor diagnostic slips like "groundedly imaginative" feel label-like without full embodied cost. Final micro-choice to lift quill earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: data density builds to doubt tightening, retracing deepens to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "dissolving fear" as blank page reconfigures from void to field. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "ice so thick... drowned pines" and volcanic stone scent filters through cartographer's priorities, constraining model via lake view. Charges final image: gazing at lake sees "sleeping giant." Micro-setting (quill, vellum) shapes poised choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed innovation) signaled early, tightens via doubt/retrace under Accum lens, narrowing to endurance of certainty. Agency in mental retracing forecloses fear path with felt cost. One deepening suffices; no multi-reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of constraint-to-catalyst emerges organically from data fusion and doubt; final poised quill offers resonant answer, reweighting blank vellum without moral. No overt statements; ambiguity in variables lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: pattern-seeing diction like "each variable a thread." Rhythmic control modulates to reverent poise; purposeful compression in data summary taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, but minor overwriting in peak poise ("crack spreading like hope’s lightning") risks muddle without payoff. No loops or scaffolds; figurative consistent if elevated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh "ignorance cartographer" premise synthesizes prediction and fantasy subversion; poised ending risks bold lyric poise, heightening stakes organically. Transformation of frozen stagnation trope feels inevitable via model.</comment>
