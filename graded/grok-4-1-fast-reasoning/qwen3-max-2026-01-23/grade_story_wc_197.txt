<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her archivist past and vow against indifference, compelling micro-choices like following the puddle map under pressure. Interiority feels embodied in steady hands and defiant smile at enforcers' arrival. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses slightly tempers perfection, but endurance earns stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to Charged Poise closure as truth broadcasts before enforcers arrive ("it was too late"). Orientation anchors immediately at lagoon's edge. One tightening via booth discovery narrows to projection with legible cost in her stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Auric lagoon's minerals amplify signal and carry truth skyward, constraining dusk timing and projection choice. Puddle reflection as micro-setting maps path and charges final image of her eyes. Sensory details (damp earth, starlight through oaks) weave purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcast truth before capture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pathfinding and projection under unraveling plans. Agency in resourcefulness forecloses flight option with on-page cost as shouts approach. Enforcers complicate without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. indifference emerges organically through microfilm faces on water and final ripple ghost. Resonant non-literal answer in "some doors, once opened, stay open" reweights prior burial without moralizing. Particulars like names (Anya Petrova) ground universality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: archivist filters via reflections and ledgers. Rhythmic prose modulates from measured steps to quiet fire, diction biased toward light/water metaphors. No head-hopping or withholding; elisions serve mystery payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., key "slid into the lock with gritty resistance, then turned with a decisive click"). Minor paraphrase echoes like repeated "truth" motifs purposeful in textural lens. Rhythm varies, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: defunct phone booth microfilm projected on auric lagoon via puddle map transforms rebel trope through low-tech ingenuity. Risky lyric closure (standing firm) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from opening unraveling.</comment>
