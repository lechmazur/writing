<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's affectionate skepticism drives contradictory impulses—compassion pulls against doubt—in somatic micro-choices during the painting. Final shift in certainty earned by prior causality (shock, geode, pill residue). Minor slip: epiphany line ("skepticism tempered by profound affection") borders tidy rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: somatic density builds from shock/geode to painting/image. On-page RR (Charged Poise) in final image and Elara's refined role, with legible cost ("certainty shift"; geode kept despite recall). Orientation anchored early (studio post-shock); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Studio micro-setting (safelight, strobe, wand) constrains choices (darkness forces somatic guidance); geode/body as recurring objects charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (ozone tingle to fractal facets). Details tactile, integrated (wand sweeps mirror spine coolness).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate pathways vs. skepticism) signaled early via Maya's plea; tightening via shock-catalyst somatic escalation narrows to body-led painting. Agency in surrender to markers forecloses doubt-path with felt cost (certainty reconfiguration). Coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (empathy visible over proof) emerges from particulars (somatic painting yields willow image). Final image reweights premise non-literally (willowglass hope refracts grief). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "subjective, yet... undeniable truth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person (Elara); perceptual signature somatic/fractal (e.g., "pressure behind her sternum echoing laughter"). Voice rhythmic, modulates intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Did you feel it too?" confirms shared resonance).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion matches beats (short somatic cues build to long exposure). "Fractally precise" patterned, not loop; rhythm varies. Minor overwrite: stacked figures in opening ("visceral reminder... charged with quiet significance") borders density slip, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: somatic light-painting via geode/pill residue transforms telepathy trope into embodied art. Risk in fractal/somatic method heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: shock catalyzes closure willow repricing.</comment>
