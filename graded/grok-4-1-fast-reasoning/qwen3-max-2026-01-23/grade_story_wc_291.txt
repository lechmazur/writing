<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness roots precise, texture-driven choices like tracing moss-slick stones, compelling the search with embodied emotion (pulse stilled). Interior conflict emerges in her guarded solitude pierced by Clara's journal ("lance" echoing her method), earning her empathy shift with felt cost. Minor tidy epiphany ("understood completely") slightly undercuts contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ribbon cue to groove, carving, journal reveal. On-page RR (Charged Poise) lands decisively as Elara places fragment against carving, reconfiguring her stance with emotional cost legible in tears. Orientation anchors quarry/quest early; single scene causality tightens options without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry micro-setting constrains via submerged ledge/moss ("fingertips found sharp groove"), charging final image (sun gilding mist-wreathed walls). Sensory hierarchy (texture over visual) reflects Elara's bias; details evolve causally (moss parted, hush hums). Purposeful selection mirrors internal opposites without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken empathy via Clara's truth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through carving/journal discoveries narrowing to personal reconfiguration. Agency in methodical lancing forecloses ignorance path with emotional cost (tears, pierced solitude). One decisive deepening suffices; cost unmistakable in vow-sealing placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges organically from particulars (silk/stone, mask/quarry), reweighting Elara's premise in journal's CR without statement. Final image (fragment against carving) offers non-literal resonance, charging prior motifs with ambiguity (freedom vs. loss). No moralizing; complexity lingers in her ignited empathy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: texture/essence over faces ("painted souls"). Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity (short sentences in reveal: "Her pulse stilled."). Prose texture distinct, compression purposeful; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (long atmospheric opens to clipped reveals); density high with multi-job lines (e.g., flint description ties method/action). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("mist clung like breath") risks figurative density in setup, but purposeful for textural lens without muddling closure. No loops; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's textural cold-case solve transforms tropes via opposites unification, feeling inevitable in carving/ribbon synthesis. Fresh perceptual angle (details as souls) risks bold POV limits heightening stakes; no derivatives.</comment>
