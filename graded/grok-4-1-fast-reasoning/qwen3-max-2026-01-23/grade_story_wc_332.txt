<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied longing in "mineral-stained fingers" and contradictory void in summoning ritual compel the decade-ache into vitalized recognition; tears as cost earn the inner-home shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds ritual density to darkroom "image bloomed," delivering conceptual repricing of dream as "living truth" with legible emotional cost in tears and settled bones.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turret framing between "islands Kael and Lyra" and silk pouch constrain light-painting choice; whispers evolve from mystery to "joyful chorus," charging final inner-light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dream capture tightens via "It was not the courtyard" reversal, deepening to essence emergence that reweights absence with tears-cost; minor abstractness tempers peak agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Photograph's "arched window emerged" offers non-literal answer to longing's cipher, reweighting dream from ghost to "state of being" via particulars without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light angles ("sliver of molten gold") and whisper bias holds stable POV; rhythm swells to "soft click" under anticipation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in ritual gestures propels to "luminous absence transformed"; varied syntax avoids loops, with purposeful metaphors coherent in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Paints with light" via saffron-moonstone filter transforms photography-dream trope organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens inner revelation stakes inevitably.</comment>
