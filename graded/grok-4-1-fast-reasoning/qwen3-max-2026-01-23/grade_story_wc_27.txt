<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "awkwardly confident grace... slightly clumsy," driving micro-choice to step closer despite mechanic's doubt; final resolve earned via embodied resonance costing anxiety's dissolution, crystallized without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via immersion density building to cadence shift; on-page Charged Poise closure in "hum now resonating within his own chest" reconfigures lull's meaning with legible emotional cost ("knot of anxiety carried since retreat" washed away).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stone circle and bare feet constrain attunement choice and charge final barefoot steps; sensory hierarchy (permacrete cold to marrow hum) filters via mechanic's gaze, evolving causally as light vanishes to star piercing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (meaning in mess) signaled early tightens via hum's deepening wave narrowing despair options; agency in closing eyes/holding glasses forces endurance crystallization with felt cost in anxiety purge, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of enduring truths emerges organically from wreckage-to-stones shift; final image of internalized hum offers resonant reweighting of rebellion's lull without moralizing, charged by grandmother memory callback.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (cosmic decay vs. mechanical notice) modulates rhythm to peak serenity; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's poised diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring resonance build; figurative layering ("thunderous serenity," "glittering like forgotten tears") coherent and pattern-taught without muddle or loops, though pervasive in peak slightly risks overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi decay with prehistoric stones transforms rebellion trope via barefoot attunement; risk-taking in lyric stasis heightens internal stakes, inevitable in hindsight via glasses lineage.</comment>
