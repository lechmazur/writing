<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in legacy drives pivotal offer of lattice; relationship crucible peaks in Elias's grip of absolution. Interiority poetic yet embodied in fingertip on scuffs. Final endurance of non-shouting restraint earned with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (copperlight, lattice, moth) reconfigures belief; Charged Poise closure at "I believe you now" with legacy cost legible in tear. Orientation anchored early; one tightening at eye-to-lattice suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurrent copperlight and jagged reef constrain revelation via scuffed door; moth as micro-setting charges witness image. Sensory selectivity (visual pulse, rime) mirrors hush stakes without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessed truth) signaled early, deepens via lattice sight with agency in gesture; cost unmistakable in Elias's recoil/tear foreclosing doubt. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth threading silence emerges via lattice/scuffs without statement; final cradling hush reweights legacy as resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in moth witness avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases to hush/light; voice rhythm modulates from chase to repose. Dialogue subtext-laden ("I chase no wolf") advances under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels but final paragraphs' paraphrase loops on "hush"/truth (e.g., "chased the hush... cradling it") dull closure image slightly. Rhythms vary read-aloud; motifs purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cry-wolf legacy ingeniously inverted via lattice proof; poetic lighthouse prison synthesis feels inevitable, risking lyric density for fresh hush-as-truth angle.</comment>
