<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots deeply in his vow, shown through precise shard placements that earn his triumph; interiority embodies weariness concretely via slow movements and tightening fingers on the lens, revealing stubborn traits under pressure. Final endurance of his life's work feels compelled by consistent traits without unearned epiphanies. Minor lack of strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds shard-by-shard, culminating in library's glow as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost of weariness transformed. Orientation anchors early (underwater library, Elias's vow). Package incites seamless causal flow to closure; constraint of broken lens shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi, coral-crusted shelves, and water-stained ledgers constrain choices (e.g., embedding in bled-ink voids) and charge final mosaic beacon. Sensory details (kelp strands, whalebone tweezers) filter through Elias's preservative gaze, mirroring internal peace. Environment evolves causally, alive and pivotal to closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving drowned voices) signaled early via vow; accumulative escalation via shard placements deepens pressure, narrowing decay's threat into testimony. Agency in "occupying impossible spaces" forces trade-offs, with tide-cycle cost visible. Entry to 8.8+ gated slightly by softer option foreclosure pre-closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing brokenness emerges organically from lens-to-stories transformation, reweighting "distress signals" without statement; final image ("stories finally at home") answers fear of forgetting non-literally. Resonance from particulars like Captain's journal avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (e.g., "chased stillness" modulating to "cherished"); rhythmic prose reflects Elias's deliberate pace under restorative pressure. No head-hopping or leakage; diction biases toward watery decay yielding to glow. Voice distinct, lyric yet legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "prisms shattered into sharp, sorrowful fragments" advances object, tone, stakes); rhythm varies for propulsion, read-aloud smooth. Minor overwrite in repeated "soft" motifs and metaphor density in peak embedding beats deducts slightly without harming closure. No loops or scaffolds obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lens shards in impossible book-spaces transforms preservation trope into time-spanning testimony; underwater library ingenuity feels inevitable from vow. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious moral calculus on brokenness elevates.</comment>
