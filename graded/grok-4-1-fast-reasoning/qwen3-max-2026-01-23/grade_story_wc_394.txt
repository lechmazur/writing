<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's steadily curious motivation drives ritualistic persistence to earned triumph; embodied tears through grease at climax reveal contradictory awe and irreverence under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through repeated rituals to RR/Charged Poise closure at "visible ripple of gold light" with legible emotional cost in tears; orientation anchored early in workshop on acid sea.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea and workshop constrain actions (hissing critiques, pattering rain) and charge final mirror image reflecting ringing stars; sensory details selectively mirror internal yearning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ringing unheard bell tightens accumulatively via circle vision, forcing transliteration agency with felt marrow cost; one decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of yearning as compass emerges organically from particulars; final sea glow and stars offer resonant non-literal answer to silent bell without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in irreverent awe ("Still dramatic, I see?") modulates rhythm under success; stable single POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion varies with scene needs, high density in workshop symphony; minor dense fig lang at "stubborn flea on furious green beast" nears overwrite but stays voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kaleidoscope visions powering yearning algorithm transforms tropes into inevitable closure; risk-taking in lyric acid-sea world heightens stakes organically.</comment>
