<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in olfactory perceptions and micro-choices like steady hands at the sweet-earth scent; motivation intensifies credibly to earned harmony at "She had not conquered the plant; she had harmonized with its truth." Minor epiphanic directness in tears moment prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from seed to shoot; on-page CR closure in final image reconfigures serenity premise with conceptual cost of embracing "life’s full spectrum." Orientation anchored early in treetop village; no shards or transitions violate scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (ozone tang, subterranean whispers) filter through olfactory bias and constrain choices like leaning close; balcony and pot as micro-setting charge final doodle image. Wildflower hush recurs purposefully to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of serenity cultivation signaled early tightens texturally via ritual beats to shoot emergence, narrowing options with felt cost of stench anticipation embraced. Agency in persistent care forces stance crystallization; one deepening at "pale shoot pierced" suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of undercurrent wisdom emerges organically from doodles, grandma quote, and journal to resonant CR without moralizing; final image reweights motion/peace question non-literally. Direct articulation in "serenity grows not despite the storm" borders echo, capping score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with olfactory perceptual signature stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from ritual slowness to charged dawn. Purposeful compression in time elisions legible under textural lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines in journal beats; rhythm varies purposefully in short ritual sentences. Minor overwriting in stacked modifiers like "intricate doodles of roots and stars hidden on its interior" dulls peak reception of seed; no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower in treetop herbalism transforms growth trope via olfactory serenity quest; risk in poetic phrasing heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: irreplaceable in olfactory-wisdom arc.</comment>
