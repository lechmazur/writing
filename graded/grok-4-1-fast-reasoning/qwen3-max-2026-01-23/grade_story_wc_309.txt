<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in "quiet ache to witness magic untouched by calculation" compels higher-stakes micro-choices like unstrapping shame at keystone; contradictory impulses (guild pressure vs simplicity) act simultaneously in embodied tears and memories poured into stone, earning final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to keystone release (pattern break via reversed mercury), delivering on-page CR closure in moonflower glow that reconfigures automation vs care with cost of guild isolation legible in her smile amid flashing spells.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Spire's crystalline facets and upward mercury-waterfalls constrain ascent and charge reversal when they "stilled, reversed"; recurring keystone glow mirrors internal states, evolving causally to jasmine scent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred simplicity vs automation) signaled early tightens via unstrapping memories that narrow retrieval option; agency in renunciation forecloses guild path with visible cost in left-behind glow and window box tending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of care over command emerges from particulars like poured memories and moonflower; final bloom offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing of "deliberate slowness" vs sterile fireworks; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure at keystone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering in spire ("needle of frozen time") accelerates accumulative propulsion; minor density in ascent descriptions avoids loops but prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fantasy automation vs handmade magic transformed via "accommodates impossibilities" into CR renunciation; fresh synthesis of lyric ascent/descent feels inevitable in moonflower payoff.</comment>
