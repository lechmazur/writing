<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to map endless night via silence is clear and consistent, embodied in precise stylus marks; mild obsession lends focus. Lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices, rendering arc too serene without struggle at pivotal completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of silence layers to Charged Poise closure at "final stroke—a small circle representing storm and calm’s eternal cycle," reweighting night with felt labor cost. Orientation anchors early; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hush—gravel settling, meltwater drip—mirrors internal states, with booklet flakes constraining marks as voids and charging final securing. Hierarchy reflects oracle's silence bias; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map emotional night signaled early, deepens via layered inscriptions under timeframe pressure; one tightening as star pales narrows options. Minimal opposition limits escalation intensity, but agency in endurance yields legible focus cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence's power emerges from mapping voids, not statement; final descent image non-literally answers endless night via preserved hush. Complexity lingers in fragile hope veins without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third, perceptual signature attuned to silence strata; rhythm modulates immersion without head-hopping. Compression of absences taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich rhythm varies, but hush/silence paraphrase loops across layers dull density; heavy figuration in mapping beats borders overwriting without payoff. Bracketed counts ignored; propulsion holds to end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle mapping silence's emotional voids transforms quiet trope; risk in lyric absence-cartography heightens stakes organically to closure cycle.</comment>
