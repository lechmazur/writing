<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong reverent motivation rooted in order's creed drives micro-choices like peripheral focus; embodied emotion peaks in "tear traced dust... connection to wisdom’s timeless flow." Interiority concrete and particular, with "strangely honest" trait constraining direct action. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to 8.7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps build density to cadence shift at silver light blooming and echo settling as RR/Charged Poise. Orientation anchored early in pavilion post-prophet; cost legible in "joints aching but spirit light." No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (boots sensing parapet pulse, dunes' breath) selectively filter through Kael's priorities, constraining peripheral method; pavilion's hum guides attention downward. Recurring sand/dunes charge final image of undisturbed clearing. Micro-setting (clearing boundary) shapes closure perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fading echo) signaled early, tightens via sync with parapet rhythm forming clearing; agency in "infinitesimal weight shifts" forecloses direct focus. Escalation under Accumulative lens via drawn echoes; cost in physical ache and humility felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of peripheral reverence vs. direct command emerges organically from ritual, reweighted in final line: "most sacred acts unfold at awareness’s edge." No moralizing; resonant CR in clearing's vigil invites ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (softened gaze, peripheral sharpening); rhythmic prose modulates serene build to expanded calm. No head-hopping or elision issues; voice biased toward order's humility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (hum, whisper) building texture; varied rhythm propels ritual without loops. Minor patterned paraphrase in echo descriptions ("fading," "dimming," "settled") dings slightly, but no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of line walker ritual via peripheral consecration transforms fantasy tropes; core premise (indirect will weaves sanctuary) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes organically.</comment>
