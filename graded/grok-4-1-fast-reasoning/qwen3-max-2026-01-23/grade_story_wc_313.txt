<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Precisely humane trait and motivation to rescue artifacts compel the pivotal rejection of the authority directive, with embodied grief ("sharp pang...tightened her throat") showing contradictory impulses in the expunge beat; earned renunciation carries visible emotional cost without label-speak dilution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from wind-chime silence to bottle rescue and final climb; on-page Charged Poise closure reconfigures memory from loss to compass ("weight of the bottle a comforting anchor") with legible emotional cost in the mirrored hush image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Slick algal cobblestones and receded reservoir constrain descent and exposure stakes; reservoir's "glassy surface reflected...stars and Oakhaven’s ghostly streets" charges final inversion image, mirroring internal shift through purposeful sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal rescue vs. bureaucratic expunge tightens accumulatively via memory unlock deepening emotional cost; agency in wrapping the bottle forecloses erasure path with felt grief price, cohering pressure to Charged Poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of past as "foundation to honor" emerges organically from artifact bridge and school plan, reweighted in final ridgeway conduit image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to loss/resilience question lingers via mirrored hush counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in selective, humane noticing (e.g., "poignant perfume of return"); rhythmic texture modulates from precise economy to charged poise, no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("shadows pooled thick even at noon, now softened by the violet bleed"); minor overwriting in descriptive runs like dusk bleed slightly muddles peak reflection beat but rhythm varies without loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of resurfacing ghost town and artifact-rescue transforms drowned-past trope via precisely humane lens; risk in quiet accumulative closure heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
