<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as quiet fire drives micro-choices like offering the lens to Hemlock, earning the communal thaw; contradictory dread and hope embodied in breath caught at carving. Hemlock's grief-to-resolve arc pressures via rasped recognition. Minor label-speak ("profoundly historically oriented") does not flatten closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: carving discovery deepens stake, rippling to harvest/bake, landing Charged Poise closure in Hemlock's "The art lives" declaration with adaptation cost legible. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (grotto, waterfall, carvings). Single scene causality tight, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto constrains via moss-slick paths for harvest and oven stones; waterfall's roar/veil charges final hymn image. Sensory hierarchy (mist's rosewater, drips signaling thaw) reflects Elara's priorities. Micro-setting (silver-leaf crevices) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive ritual) signaled early, tightens via silver-leaf realization narrowing perfection to adaptation; agency in Elara's insistence forces communal endurance with grief cost felt in Hemlock's tear. Escalation accumulates density to charged sharing under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of living heritage emerges from carving-to-bread arc, final "culture is a seed" image resonating non-literally via bittersweet flavor without moralizing. Recurring leaf motif reweights honey-dependence premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (verdant filter resolving carvings); voice lyrical yet biased (historical lens on "forgotten histories"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The stone remembers"), distinct from narration. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; figurative pattern ("rose thorn" hope, "healing incantation") taught early pays off in thawed hum without muddle. Minor overwriting in dread descriptions (-0.3) but closure propulsion clean, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silver-leaf twist transforms beekeeper-centric trope into resilient adaptation; hidden city's carvings as memory-anchor fresh synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens communal charge without gimmick.</comment>
