<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in Liam's "Can stars shine without burning?" compels persistent polishing choices, embodied in knee ache and hand strokes; interiority concrete via grandmother's echo. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, smoothing internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through polishing progression to Charged Poise closure in "earthbound state was not confinement but refinement," reweighting limitation with knee's cost legible in "steps deliberate and purposeful despite the ache."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto's drip "like a slow, patient heartbeat" and fissure light constrain polishing, mirroring internal reveal; knee as micro-setting charges final "path home felt sacred beneath her feet," evolving causally with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to craft fireless light tightens accumulatively via polishing cadence to weighing pause, deepening knowledge of "light already sleeping within"; cost felt in physical refinement and foreclosed climbing, charging Liam's envisioned wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of light via patience emerges organically from glass's "cloudy veil" surrender, resonating in final CR of "touch the heavens... with her heart" without moralizing; sea glass motif recharges without token recurrence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with star-watcher signature in "pocket-sized sanctuary of calm" and "dancing stars upon his wall"; rhythmic modulation from "slow, rhythmic strokes" to dawn release heightens meditative pressure without slippage.</comment>
