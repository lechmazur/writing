<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her "gentle, persistent ache" and symphonically minded perception, driving micro-choices like selecting specific cracks. Embodied emotion peaks in the vibration traveling her arm and tears during the first strum. Minor flaw: idealized without sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but closure endurance feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hedgehog cue through layered strums to siskin's trill as Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (dawn grove, Elara post-hedgehog). Closure cost legible in "gentle surrender" crack and emotional release; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details selective (damp litter, cool porcelain, low hum) filter through Elara's bias, with sculpture cracks constraining strums. Grove subtly guides: alders frame sculpture, moss cradles insulator. Recurring sculpture charges final image as "bridge."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music from silence) signaled early, escalates texturally via strum-deepening (low hum to full melody of endurance). Agency in deliberate crack choices narrows to "peace" release. Felt cost in tears and ache charges siskin response; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of conversing with weighted silence emerges via tree's "sorrowful score" unlocked into melody, culminating in "silence... deepened, enriched." Final image (insulator-bridge, alders leaning) reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with symphonic perceptual signature ("absence as... dissonant chord"). Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, prose texture distinct and biased. No elision or head-hopping; compression purposeful for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "strum... low hum vibrated" advances sound/feel/emotion). Figurative density heavy but pattern-taught (musical metaphors) pays off at closure without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops on "silence" (−0.3), but propulsion clear; no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Core premise (strumming tree cracks with insulator for music/empathy) fresh synthesis transforms silence trope organically. Risky lyric structure heightens resonance; insulator reprise inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
