<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through precise actions, but interiority leans atmospheric over deeply contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; strain in bones offers embodied glimpse yet lacks character-particular flaw complicating the rupture choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from frost mandala to rustling crescendo; on-page CR closure via rupture's "eternity compressed" reconfigures library with felt strain cost, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard and frost patterns constrain alignment choice and charge final cloud-sea echo; sensory hierarchy (rustle, ozone, trembling leaves) filters through Elara's cryptic priorities, evolving causally to mirror destabilization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compress eternity) tightens via growing rustling/symphony narrowing system stability; agency in lever pull forecloses stasis with bone-strain cost legible under accumulative lens, though no micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of entropy evolving perfect systems emerges organically from particulars like orbiting books and pulsing trees; final "deeper truth" image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cryptic perceptual signature (refracted light, temporal currents); rhythmic prose modulates from serene to crescendo intensity, diction purposeful and biased to Elara's shaper worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion syncing rhythm to escalation (gentle rustle to silent explosion); minor figurative density in climax coherent and pattern-taught, no loops or scaffolds dulling rupture image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass orchard, frost maps, and eternity compression feels inevitable; bold reality-negotiation premise transforms stasis tropes via specific destabilization payoff.</comment>
