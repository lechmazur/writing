<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to plant second thoughts is embodied in his no-correction method and hearing unspoken words, earning Leo's final shift from "I am not enough" to "You taught me my thoughts matter." Contradictory impulses (humble vs. rebellion) act in the vulnerable king placement. Students add pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from workshop to town placements to observed reconsiderations, culminating in Charged Poise closure as mist lifts on transformed town. One tightening via synchronized displays narrows to quiet success with felt endurance cost. Orientation anchors early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt library and mist-veiled streets constrain choreography (dew-slicked stones, precise grotto alignment). Grotto as micro-setting charges final image, kissed by dawn's gold. Sensory selection (cool weight, pluming breath) reflects Elias's reverent priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humble rebellion vs. rigid certainty) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through placements to town responses (woman's flicker, mail carrier's wonder). Agency in sending students and vulnerable king forecloses shouting path with vulnerability cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet reflection emerges from chess tableaus (queen shielding pawn) and observed second thoughts, answered non-literally by town's spirit shift. Final Leo-hand image reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity in subtle transformation avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (unspoken words as symphony) stable in single POV, modulating rhythm to hush's deepening. Compression purposeful and taught early, legible at closure. Elevated diction fits coach's reverent lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mist coiled... cradled the magnetic grotto, feeling its cool weight"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (forests, symphony) pattern-taught without muddle in peak placements. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess as quiet rebellion via window displays and unspoken-hearing transforms trope organically. Risky hushed structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via grotto reprise. No derivative echoes.</comment>
