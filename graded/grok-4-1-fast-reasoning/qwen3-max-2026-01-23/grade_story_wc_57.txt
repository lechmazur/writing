<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve methods intensifies through patient decoding, embodied in finger-tracing and reverence; fisherman adds trust pressure. Internal change earned via realization. Minor weakness: early "infinitely patient" label lacks contradictory impulse under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from waiting to decoding to CR closure ("understanding settle deep within her"); cost legible in shifted preservation view. Orientation anchored early (dock, snow, fog). One tightening via knot reveal narrows to piling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (muffled snow, fog hush, rope texture) reflects patience, constrains via piling hollow. Evolving details (thinning fog, glittering snow) charge final image. Micro-setting (rope, glass) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulgurite via decoding) signaled early; accumulative deepening through knot density forces realization trade-off. Agency in patient coaxing; felt cost in eternal method over object. No reversals needed, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of method-resilience emerges organically from knots-to-glass arc, reweighted in fisherman's murmur and final pulse without statement. Subtext in silence/gestures; resonant CR ending recharges weave motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in seed/knot poetics modulates rhythmically. Minimal dialogue natural, subtextual ("We guard the method"). No head-hopping; diction fits collector's reverence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short breaths in decoding); purposeful metaphors (tapestry, weave) taught early, pay off cohesively. Minor hush repetition pattern-supported; no loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Knot-decoding for secrets transforms folklore tropes via textural accumulation; fulgurite synthesis feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
