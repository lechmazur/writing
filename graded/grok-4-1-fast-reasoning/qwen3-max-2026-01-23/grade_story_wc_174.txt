<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied serenity and contradiction via ink fingers cradling stick amid Lena's echoing accusation; pivotal realization earned through prior puppet critique. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "ethics resided not in reversing a story’s moral, but in reversing the storyteller’s role" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly with density building to CR closure; "surrendering the strings" delivers legible ego cost on-page. Orientation anchored immediately in dome hush; single reflective scene tightens to charged poise without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome's fractured aperture and moonlight beam constrain reflection while charging closure as "profound, patient listening"; story stick as micro-setting recurs tactilely to mirror internal shift. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via accusation pierce to epiphany tightening; agency in renunciation forecloses puppet control with ego cost felt in resolve. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal listening emerges organically from stick motif and dome mirror, resonant CR in "surrender of ego was the true exploration"; final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (cosmic hush, ink grace) stable in close third; rhythmic modulation heightens serenity-to-resolve without leakage. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel reflection, metaphors coherent around hush motif; minor paraphrase loops on "reversal"/epiphany (e.g., cumulative 118-193) dull late momentum slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher transcribing bar voices via story stick transforms puppet trope organically; risk in quiet dome epiphany heightens ethical stakes authentically.</comment>
