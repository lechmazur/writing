<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particularity in Elara's diligent traits shown through reverent cleaning and rake legacy; interior contradiction in legacy weight vs. daily task earns her inscription choice with embodied ache. Minor reflection block anchors well to present but nears BRR ceiling without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to pendulum pause CR; orientation anchors by para 2 (Elara, ridge, dawn tide). Closure cost legible in "spirit fused with ancestral purpose," reweighting legacy with undeniable daily practice price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian grit constrains pivot choice; pendulum bob and rake handle charge final image as micro-settings mirroring balance. Sensory hierarchy (crunch, cold rail, dust motes) reflects diligent POV narrowing to task immediacies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore clock/balance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via grit choke to pause reverie forcing stance crystallization. Cost felt in legacy fusion foreclosing abstract time vs. carved practice; agency in calibrated push drives peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges organically from inscriptions to her vow, final obsidian pools nod recharges without moralizing. Resonant CR answers balance question via tide/gull image, embracing daily tide-cost complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in ethical precision ("reverent precision, mind empty but for task"); rhythmic texture modulates from meditative ascent to searing pause. Voice bias filters setting through ancestral duty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "pushed with calibrated force" surges to pause); varied rhythm breathes with scene. Ignore bracketed counts as tokens; purposeful "balance" recurrence taught early avoids loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwinder diligence and rake inscriptions transforms absolution trope into pendulum-pause reverie. Risky lyric accumulative frame heightens legacy stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
