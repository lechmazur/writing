<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like the bathroom ritual yielding intuitive shift from extraction to exchange. Interiority particular to curator's artifact-handling steadiness crumbling into tears freezing on cheeks. Minor slip in diagnostic labels like "brightened disquiet" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from bewilderment to resonant reconfiguration; closure Charged Poise in cameo etching and ledger completion reweights stewardship with solemn emotional cost legible in "tears freezing" and "sacred trust." Orientation anchored early in habitat/orchard. Shards (bathroom, surface) transition legibly without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Astral orchard constrains choices (viewport press, surface kneel) and charges final image via silver blossoms etching cameo. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: regolith crunch grounds ethereal light. Micro-setting of pistachio shell as tool integrates tactilely, mirroring internal mosaic in sink reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden activation) signaled early tightens via bathroom deepening—shift to receiving aligns frequency, foreclosing extractive path with felt cost in frustration release. Textural pressure coheres to agency in silent intent. No reversal overload; single cadence shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mutual exchange vs. extraction emerges organically from particulars like orchard's flare response and ledger dialogue. Final image resonant non-literal answer: inheritance complete reweights pursuit as stewardship without moralizing. Subtext in "stop trying to take and start learning to receive" layers ambiguity profitably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in curator-filtered details (etched bark as constellations, droplets as planets). Rhythmic modulation builds to compressed intensity in "warmth bloomed in her palms." Stable third-limited; no head-hopping despite shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring emotional cadence, peaking in "light streamed... etching a cascade of sensations." Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., time as tapestry/river) during early bewilderment slightly muddles but doesn't touch closure. No loops; read-aloud rhythm strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pistachio shell cameo with nonlinear orchard transforms tropes into inevitable payoff—blank vessel fills via emotional resonance. Risky lyric compression of inheritance pays off in ledger's carved last page, heightening conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
