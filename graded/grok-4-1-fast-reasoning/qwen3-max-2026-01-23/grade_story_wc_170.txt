<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via faltering heartbeat, compelling endurance to completion; embodied via dizziness and steady voice. Internal conflict subtle but shown in "wave of dizziness... voice never wavered." Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from initial positioning to mirror transformations culminating in Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early in ascent and terrace details. Cost legible in "borrowed heartbeat... stilled" as painter fades.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet droplets and fractured light constrain positioning and charge transformations, mirroring internal renewal. Sensory hierarchy selective to painter's calm absorption. Final valley image recharged by prior prism details elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (persuade mirrors) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via heart falter forcing continued singing. Agency in persistent lullabies forecloses path with on-page cost (heartbeat's end). Enters 8+ via trade-off but lacks micro-turn for higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges organically from barren-to-blooming mirrors without statement. Final golden valley image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting regret with conceptual cost of witnessed possibility. No moralizing; ambiguity in lingering warmth invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature of "measured breath" and history-etched absorption. Rhythmic control heightens dusky pressure; purposeful compression taught early pays off in fading image. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring hush-to-bell swell; read-aloud rhythm natural. Minor overwriting in "liquid rainbows... liquid hope" metaphors slightly muddles peak density without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh magical synthesis of mirage painter, borrowed child-heart, and song-alchemy transforms renewal tropes inevitably. Risky lyric escalation from mirrors to valley reconfigures premise organically. Irreplaceable heartbeat engine heightens stakes uniquely.</comment>
