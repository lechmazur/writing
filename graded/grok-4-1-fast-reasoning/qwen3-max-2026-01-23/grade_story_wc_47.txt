<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in tracing the pendant and kneeling ritual, earning the release with contradictory impulses toward passive waiting versus action; final renunciation of the token shows character-particular growth. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("quietly proactive") in reflective beats slightly distances raw vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation and steady density build to Charged Poise closure; pendant pressed into moss ("tiny fossil of courage") marks legible before/after with surrender cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned data center vividly constrains choices via icicle path and moss altar, charging the final image where amber gleams; sensory details (pollen drift, spongy moss) selectively mirror internal thaw without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting meaning post-viral wound) signaled early and deepens via ritual path-following; agency in proffering pendant forecloses retrieval with felt relational cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative release emerges organically from moss-over-tech images and icicle patience, resonating in final glance-back without moralizing; whisper and breeze-stirred hush offer non-literal reweighting of regret.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature (patterns, green veins) biased toward watchful renewal; rhythmic modulation builds hush texture purposefully, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel ritual, but final third's paraphrase loops ("proffered regret...received a pattern"; multiple "honeyed hush") and consistent figurative density dull peak propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh icicle-map ritual in reclaimed data center transforms abandonment tropes into healing crucible; risk of overt lyricism pays off in charged, inevitable closure image.</comment>
