<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies through embodied fear voiced into the diary gap, earning her renegotiation with the Warden; contradictory impulses peak there, compelling the closure choice with visible relational cost to Kael.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oriented early in mountain bookstore; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (gaps, vines, blooming stone) tightens to CR closure when Warden steps aside after Elara's challenge, with honesty as felt cost in "a single luminous tendril sprouted."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves and stone constrain renegotiation, charging final "stairway of soft light"; sensory hierarchy (rustle, glow, groan) filters through Elara's linguistic bias, evolving causally with vine sprout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Kael's dissolution) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via diary void to Warden pressure, forcing agency in "I renegotiate the terms" that forecloses failure path with voiced fear as on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unlearned lessons as invitations emerges organically from gap-cultivation pattern, reweighted in final image of "tending gardens of unlearned lessons" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to compassion's void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in linguistic metaphors ("grammar in the grooves"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, as Kael's rasp advances stakes; rhythmic modulation peaks at Warden exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (voids, symphonies) but minor overwrite in opening metaphors slightly dulls propulsion; no loops, clean syntax varies for ear, clarity holds at closure vine moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic gaps as maps transforms library trope; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via diary's "language of potential" driving renegotiation.</comment>
