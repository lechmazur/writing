<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (tremor vs certainty) act in the offering beat; final self-acceptance earned by map surrender with embodied cost (tear, lightness). Interiority concrete and particular via artistic lens on cracks/booth. No diagnostic speak; flaws (avoidance) drive dare.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to CR closure where hole-as-lens reweights external quest internally, cost legible in "unspooling of self-deception." Orientation anchored by ~100 words (Elara at station midnight). Single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via arrow-to-booth path and charges closure ("now-seamless pavement"); sensory hierarchy (mist/parting, stone/ozone) mirrors internal unraveling. Micro-setting (booth slot, rain pool) enables punch and reflection. No white-room; lived-in via ivy, echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (fortress quest) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to map offering narrowing options; agency in surrender forecloses armor with cost (vulnerability, tear). Pressure coheres under lens without reversal need. Climax punch reconfigures knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (internal truths) emerges via crack-arrows pointing "inward," resonant CR in hole-lens image reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in map-scars offering; no tidy binary, ambiguity in "trembling certainty."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with artistic perceptual signature ("drainage grates into symphonies"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "crystalline thunk." Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, but dense figuratives ("living manuscript," "axis upon which") border overwriting in offering beat without obscuring; minor paraphrase loops ("precise moment," "profound"). Propulsion clear to closure image; no filter stacks or templates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cracks-as-cartography transforms quest trope; risk in lyric internalization heightens stakes, inevitable in hole-as-heart-lens. No template echoes; particularized via vellum map regrets.</comment>
