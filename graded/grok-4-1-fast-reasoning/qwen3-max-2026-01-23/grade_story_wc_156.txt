<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal third awakening dramatizes internal conflict between scholarly legacy and curiosity, earning choice to renounce certainty with embodied cost in whispered question and journal sketch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through sound layering to nested awakenings, delivering CR closure in nickel's cooling and garden's resuming symphony with legible personal cost of foreclosed certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Garden's resonant elements like crystal chimes and dewdrop reflection constrain the sound-prism inciting incident and charge final harmonizing trees, filtered through restorer's pigment-attuned perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of authentic restoration tightens accumulatively via nested deepenings, agency in surrender to pause forcing exchange with visible cost crystallized in three journal words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of living dialogue over frozen certainty emerges implicitly from awakenings, final nickel return and "heavy cloak" image offering resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature ("sound was architecture") remains stable and biased through pressure, rhythmic modulation peaking in breathless pause.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax to closure hum, but minor figurative stacking in "gentle bewitchment...blooming flower" slightly blurs awakening peak without harming image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Hobo nickel as acoustic prism ingeniously synthesizes folk art with sound-garden physics, transforming restoration trope into nested perceptual risk that inevitability charges transformed purpose.</comment>
