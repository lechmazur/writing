<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Socially perceptive trait concretely guides mandala placements, rooting motivation in personal unraveling; embodied emotions via felt whispers and chalk-stained fingers; earned change in resolve to integrate peaks without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from flake whisper to mandala hush; on-page closure via "Integrate" as Resonant Reconfiguration reweighting unlearning with impermanence cost in blurring sands; orientation anchored early in grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lilac mist and emerald moss constrain choices, filtering through Elara's perceptual bias; sand mandala as micro-setting charges final image of blurring grains, embodying impermanence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interjecting into chaos tightens accumulatively via whispers drawn to mandala symmetry then anxious "What remains?"; agency in speaking "Integrate" forecloses dissonance with legible hush-deepening cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of chaos's sacred geometry emerges organically from mandala-weaving whispers; final "Integrate" and blurring sands offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting pain-as-alchemy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in emotional textures (brittle grudges, warm sighs); rhythmic lyricism modulates from unease to hush, apt for artist's mind; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lilac/whisper recurrence building texture; varied syntax propels from plink to emergent hush; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., iron filings) contained without closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional whispers into geometric alchemy transforms mandala trope via perceptual gift; "Integrate" turn inevitable from prior patterns, risking lyric hush payoff.</comment>
