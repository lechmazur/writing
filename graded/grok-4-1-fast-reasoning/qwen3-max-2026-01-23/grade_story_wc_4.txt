<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions like opening the case for Liam; interiority shows via heart swelling and savoring the bench. Multiple characters apply pressure through interactions but remain clear. Lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal moments, slightly idealizing her without flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from Liam's change to community exhibit via repeated visitor examples, one tightening in communal mounting of photos. Orientation anchored early in field/factory. Closure as CR in harvest moon gathering and empty case reconfigures pain to hope with patience/time cost legible in final vine/firefly image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like rustling lavender and climbing vines integrate into action, mirroring internal healing; field/factory constrains as sanctuary for gatherings. Recurrent vines charge final image, evolving causally. No generic placeholders; POV-filtered through Elara's calm observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute pain) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via visitor vignettes tightening to town exhibit; agency in Elara's invitations/method forces communal shift. Cost felt in Liam's tear and her patient lingering. No major reversals needed under lens; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at moon gathering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of connections healing emerges organically from arcs/visitors, final firefly/vine image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting loss to resilience without moralizing. Subtext in silences/tears; complexity in bitterness-to-belonging avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with perceptual signature (calm grace, silver arcs); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating to whimsy in boy's exclamation. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, like Elara's murmur advancing Liam's turn. No head-hopping; rhythmic prose fits accumulative calm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism, but figurative density (arcs, tapestries, alchemical) borders overwriting in descriptive beats without always advancing pressure; minor paraphrase loops in arc/vine recurrences. Rhythm varies read-aloud; closure image clear/propulsive. Clean mechanics overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photo-arcs restoring community in post-factory ruins transforms healing trope via specific method/images. Vines/fireflies as original inflections grow from particulars; bold lyric accumulative structure heightens without gimmick. No derivative templates.</comment>
