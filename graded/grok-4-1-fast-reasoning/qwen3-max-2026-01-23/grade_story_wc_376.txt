<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's wilting hands embody internal conflict, acting simultaneously as compass and flaw, compelling higher-stakes ventures like inserting the fragment; final unwilting earned via candor encounters. Contradictory impulses surface in market aches versus child-stilled hands. 9+ test met with on-page cost in steady hands for new inscription.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of candor moments (child, elder) tightens to chamber CR, reweighting map as mirror with conceptual cost in "lost conversations...lived in the candor of small moments." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; mosaic shards legible, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse domes stained ochre, hydroponic exaggerations, thorny jasmine slot constrain choices (prying floorboard, sliding fragment); dry basin charges final realization image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (hand warmth from truths). 9+ test: setting recharges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost conversations) signaled early; accumulative deepening via candor points narrows to chamber, foreclosing wilting path with felt cost in warmed palm and unwilting hands. Agency in piecing/venturing drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of candor as oasis emerges organically from child/elder moments to CR: "honesty was the deepest oasis," reweighting premise without statement. Final gold leaf with child's words offers non-literal resonance. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (gold trembling at lies, vision blurring on etching) stable single POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (child's confession stills hands). Rhythmic control modulates pressure to charged poise in dipped brush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels (e.g., "Stone groaned. A hidden door swung inward."); purposeful lyric figuration coherent, no loops/artifacts dulling echoes chamber image. 9+ test: zero scaffold, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wilting calligrapher mapping echoes via candor transforms relic-hunt trope; risk-taking mosaic/lyric heightens stakes to CR without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight in "map was never a guide...but a mirror."</comment>
