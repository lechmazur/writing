<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation to create beauty from ruins drives precise pruning choices, with embodied tastes (tart joy, metallic salt) revealing character under pressure; credible endurance in honoring past via cuts shows change with felt emotional cost. Minor flaw: "informally wise" leans label-like without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prunes accumulate tasted memories toward planting/channeling climax, with on-page closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (shoot emerges, tastes promise) reweighting ruins into renewal; cost legible in tears and "weight of ruins replaced by lightness." Orientation anchored by word 25; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains pruning/planting, with moonlight panes/beam guiding choices and charging final image of "rust now framed by green"; sensory details (crunch, damp decay) selective via chef's priorities. Environment evolves causally from jungle to cradle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty from ruins) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via memory-prunes under alignment pressure, forcing channel-stance; agency in cuts/planting forecloses neglect path with tears as cost. One decisive deepening suffices under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of nurture over abandonment emerges organically from prunes-to-fruit arc, with final "living testament" image resonating non-literally on memory-into-future question. Minor Thematic Echo in "gentle rebellion was complete" slightly tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (tasting memories, embodied chef lens); rhythmic prose modulates from reverent to charged at growth, diction purposeful/poetic without register drift. No dialogue; elisions (synaptic plasticity) taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in final third ("pruned despair and planted resilience," "no longer a tomb but a cradle," "woven it into a beautiful future," "testament to what grows") create synonym churn dulling closure image (−1.2); overwriting with stacked metaphors (liquid starlight, emerald shoot) risks muddle in peak. Density strong otherwise, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, synaptic plasticity, celestial seeding transforms ruin-trope into inevitable renewal arc; risk in fantastical method (tasting rewires brain) heightens stakes via irreplaceable particulars like bride's laughter memory.</comment>
