<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to spark revolution roots in inventive traits and compels micro-choices like gnomon adjustment under duty's mask; internal conflict embodied in "stern duty uniform beat a quiet motivation." Minor label-speak ("calmly inventive mind") slightly abstracts peak resolve but doesn't undermine pivotal agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with intrigue density tightening from blackout invitation to moss pulse answered; Charged Poise closure at "Kael resumed his post, face a mask of stoic duty" reconfigures silence with legible risk cost in vigilant posture. Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Half-painted sundial constrains gnomon choice and charges shadow-slice panel reveal; twilight blackout evolves tactilely ("twilight’s last silver light gilding"), mirroring internal hush. Sensory hierarchy (shadows over light) biases inventively without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early tightens accumulatively via shadow-code success to network pulse; agency in panel seam thumb and moss crush forecloses detection path with felt cost in "posture radiating dutiful vigilance." No reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shadow-ink revolution emerges organically from sundial geometry and moss flare; final "revolution turned its first silent page" resonantly reweights decree's hush without moralizing, charged by prior silence motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in geometric precision ("angle calculated from star charts"); rhythmic diction modulates from hush to thrum under pressure, no elision or hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "gnomon clicked... shadow sliced" advances action/atmosphere); minor figurative density ("shadows leaned close") in setup doesn't muddle peak moss-crush clarity. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial-shadow cipher transforms revolution trope into geometric ingenuity, inevitable from inventive calm; risk of "unseen watcher" heightens without gimmick, fresh synthesis in moss-pulse network.</comment>
