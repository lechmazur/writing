<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation from Anya's loss anchors concrete micro-choices in signing ritual; contradictory solitude/joy impulses act in Lily encounter. Lily as secondary pressures duet, altering isolation. Minor reflection summary dilutes peak embodiment slightly before closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: gesture density builds to Charged Poise RR at "he was seen," reconfiguring exile with joyful sorrow cost legible in final walk. Orientation anchored by para 2 (Elias, pier, moon). Single scene fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor pier constrains ritual (planks, swells guide arcs); moonlit ripples charge signing and final image ("sun touched the water"). Sensory hierarchy (visual/silent/tactile) biases to Elias's silence perception. Micro-setting (camera, hands) evolves with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation via silence translation) signaled early; textural deepening via Lily's gasp/duet narrows solitude, forces connection stance. Cost felt in "joyful sorrow" chord at climax. Agency in shared signs; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence as eloquent music/invitation) emerges from signing particulars, reweighted non-literally in "silent symphony in his hands." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in bittersweet persistence. Final image answers "What are you painting?" via bridge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (silence/gestures bias); rhythmic modulation peaks in duet ("hands wove a duet"). Sign "dialogue" natural/subtextual. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short arcs amid long sentences); density high but propels texturally. Minor figurative density ("liquid silver," "pearl-bright") risks overwrite in opening but patterns to closure image without muddle. No loops; scaffold-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empty camera frames sign ritual transforming silence trope into connective music. Risky lyric gesture-density heightens stakes organically. "Whispering advisor" premise follows implications to invitation payoff without retreat.</comment>
