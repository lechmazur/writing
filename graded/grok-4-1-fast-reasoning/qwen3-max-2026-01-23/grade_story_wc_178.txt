<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frugal trait embodied concretely in oil measurement and lamp surrender, compelling alignment choice; contradictory skepticism-devotion impulses act in patient overlay to revelation. Diagnostic phrasing like "empirically ironic core" dilutes peak embodiment slightly before climax payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds schematics to resonance; on-page RR closure at "alignment clicked... Warmth flowed—not heat, but recognition," with legible cost in "surrender to truer starlight" foreclosing isolated seeking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tile as micro-setting constrains pivotal rotation and charges final "pulsed with covenant warmth"; dust-scented air, cedar table filter through astronomer's priorities, mirroring internal poise without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to seal covenant tightens texturally via schematic overlays to decisive rotation under accumulative lens; agency in alignment forces trade-off, with cost crystallized in transformed frugality charging lamp extinguishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of rigor-to-reverence emerges organically through math-star unveiling; undermined by explicit echoes like "empirically ironic truth crystallized" and final-line moral "to seek with sincerity is to be found," replacing charged image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with numeric-cosmic perceptual signature ("Jupiter’s azimuth to numeral three") modulates rhythmically from anticipation to harmony; stable close-third POV, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, vivid sensory integration; minor paraphrase churn in late repeats ("schematic representations" x5) slightly dulls closure image but reads as taught lyric refrain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian magic square as disguised star-chart covenant transforms math mysticism trope; risk-taking in poetic accumulative form heightens revelation without gimmick.</comment>
