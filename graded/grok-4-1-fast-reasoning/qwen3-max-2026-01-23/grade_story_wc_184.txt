<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Steady hands tracing gears and litany of names embody archivist's methodical poise under anomaly pressure; weave choice earned by prior motivation without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Door anomaly to seal spotting to fable recall to rope weave chains causality under accumulative lens; final door shimmer and gear resumption deliver RR closure with integration cost legible in "liquid memory" flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oil-stained floorboards and cedar rope stand constrain kneeling/weaving choices; dust motes and shuddering gears charge final image, filtering through archivist's void-attuned perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anomaly stake tightens via weave committing to loss-honoring; door's watercolor blur makes foreclosed erasure path's cost visceral under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rope gaps shifting to integrated weave reweights "fables of absence" premise organically; clock's "richer and more resonant" chime offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archivist's perceptual signature—"cool void of omitted threads"—biases noticing toward absences; syntax rhythmically swells from ascent calm to halt tension without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Sunlight fractured... illuminating dust motes" packs sensory propulsion; zero loops or scaffolds sustain density through climax weave with varied openings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Fables of Absence" premise transforms archival voids into tactile resolution uniquely; rope motif's weave turn feels inevitable from early blueprint mismatch.</comment>
