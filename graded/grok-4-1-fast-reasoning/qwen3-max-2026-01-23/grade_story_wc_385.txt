<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel echoes intensifies compellingly via embodied perception (marrow vibration, shell warmth) and culminates in earned release through singing; contradictory melancholy and compassion act simultaneously without tidy resolution. Minor slips in label-speak ("richly perceptive nature") slightly abstract interiority but do not touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shell disclosures build density to RR closure (echoes freed, shell cools forever) with legible emotional cost in tears and vow; one tightening via final revelation narrows to compassionate song. Orientation anchored early in nexus under stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus and shell constrain choices (labyrinth path, starlit heat) and charge closure image (stone exhales); sensory hierarchy (vibration over sight) reflects perceptual bias, mirroring internal melancholy without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve persistent echoes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through disclosures forcing stance shift to release; agency in singing forecloses judgment path with tears as felt cost charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trapped grief released via compassion emerges organically from echo particulars and singing arc; final sanctuary image resonantly reweights intrigue as mended connection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (echoes as emotional anchors) and rhythmic modulation (lyrical swells to quiet cadence); diction biased to reed-melancholy fits Elara without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyrical rhythm, but figurative layering ("tapestry of cold, watchful stars") borders overwriting in opening without obscuring closure; no loops, clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo folklore and progressive revelation transforms betrayal trope into perceptual quest; poetic canyon voice feels inevitable and risks bold lyricism heightening release stakes.</comment>
