<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in scholarly patience drives precise actions like redrawing the rune; embodied emotion peaks in tears tracing dust at revelation (line 258). Minimal internal contradiction limits to very strong; no therapy-speak or stock phrasing. Final peace earned by prior causality without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore: key insertion → resistance → rune redraw → awakening DC. Orientation anchored early (observatory, Aethel by ~50 words). Closure decisive as wall dissolves (line 223), revealing shadows with emotional cost in tears; persistent constraint of corrupted runes shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orrery constrains key choice (slot in moon's orbit, line 128) and charges final humming image (line 268). Sensory hierarchy scholarly: glyphs, clicks, whirrs filtered through rune expertise. Vivid integration like moonstone chalk amid dust motes avoids white-room; floating isle subtly mirrors drift toward revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadow mystery) signaled early, tightens via grinding resistance forcing rune agency (lines 156-186). Cost legible in anticipated struggle and tears; causal escalation narrows to zenith closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of relearning reality's loops emerges via particulars: Spoon-Bending → corrupted runes → mended awakening. Final image of sun-gazing readiness (line 319) reweights premise non-literally, embracing endless cycles with quiet ambiguity over tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: starlight eyes, glyph-tracing bias. Rhythmic control modulates from deliberate setup to surging gears (line 207); diction precise, lexicon scholarly without drift. No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., key description advances stakes, line 108); rhythm varies, no loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in metaphors (shadows as serpents/origami, line 233) coherent but slightly muddles peak without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-spoon reality's rune shifts enable shadow sanctuary premise, transformed via loop-closing ingenuity. Risky pocket dimension payoff inevitable from orrery tactics; no template echoes, bold world logic commits fully.</comment>
