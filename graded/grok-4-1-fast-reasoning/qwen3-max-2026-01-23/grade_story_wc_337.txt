<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her fractured spirit, embodied via scarred fingers and tears; micro-choices in unraveling compel her change. Internal conflict subtle but present in handling sorrow mirroring her own. Final realization earned without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot-unraveling beats densify silence and memories toward RR/CR closure. Final knot's surrender with spirits dissolving delivers on-page cost in Elara's tears and settled unrest. Orientation anchored crisply in opening paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prisms fracturing starlight into "rivers of sapphire and silver" constrain via chime acknowledgments and charge final "starlight, no longer fractured" image. Sensory details (salt-tinged air, moss-flecked floor) selective, POV-biased, evolve with hush. Micro-setting (net, dais) guides every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits via truth-exhuming) signaled early, accumulates via knot-deepening with memory releases narrowing to final anguish knot. Agency in persistent unraveling forecloses unrest with emotional cost legible in spirits' dissolution and Elara's tears. One decisive intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of weaving breaks into wholeness emerges organically from net-unraveling and Elara's parallel arc, culminating in non-literal final image of smooth net and mended fractures. Subtext in "interlaced hush" carries ambiguity without moralizing. Resonance reweights restoration premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in fractured light and accumulating hush; diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled, modulating from dissonance to peace. Minimal dialogue natural ("You are remembered"). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene cadence, high density in knot beats; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("woven calm," "living tapestry") coherent but borders muddle in peak hush swell. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure image. Propulsion strong, read-aloud ear-pleasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask-restorer unraveling grief-net transforms ritual trope into textural drive; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established pattern, no derivative echoes.</comment>
