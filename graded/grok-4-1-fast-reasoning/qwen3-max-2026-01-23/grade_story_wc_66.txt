<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via ink-stained fingers and pulse as "frantic drum"; motivation intensifies through vow to "teach dust," earning shift to "gardener of ghosts" with embodied risk in flinch. Contradictory compulsion vs. secrecy acts simultaneously under interference pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via building transcription beats to Charged Poise closure in journal's "solid weight" and dust waking, with legible conceptual cost of ongoing secrecy; orientation anchored in first paragraph; one micro-turn at interference tightens without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ember coals, spectral green glow, and mist-veined window constrain choices (cloak muffles light/sound) and charge final image of dust motes humming; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (copyist's focus on nib/lyrics); evolved details mirror internal thistled calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of secretive transcription signaled early, escalates texturally via density of luminous phrases and interference flinch narrowing options; agency in persistent endurance forecloses exposure path with felt pulse-cost; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of narrative revival emerges organically from lyric fragments and dust visions, reweighted in final "keys turned... in a lock of silence" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer via reborn sentences amid famine cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "luminous quality" noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks at "thorns of risk"; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure image, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pen a needle stitching silence"); varied rhythm avoids monotony; overwrought metaphors pattern-taught (thistle/dust/luminous) without muddle in peak interference beat or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of story famine, lyric subversion, and dust midwifery transforms dystopian tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens resonant closure without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight via copyist-to-gardener arc.</comment>
