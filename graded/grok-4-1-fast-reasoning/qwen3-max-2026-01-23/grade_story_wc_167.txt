<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied ritual (kneeling, damp knees) reveals contradictory impulses of rebellion and reverence; final renewal earned via pond observation. Minor slip in abstract "noctilucent reckonings" phrasing borders unearned, but anchors to present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from stone *plink* to light weaving rings, culminating in CR closure ("shift honored: from silent contemplation to active grace") with legible cost of transience absorbed. Single scene fits defaults; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pearl Bay's mist-slick cobbles, obsidian pond, and prism atrium constrain ritual and charge final image (atrium "blazing with captured dawn"). Sensory hierarchy glazier-specific (light fracture, condensation paths); evolves causally with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (communion for reckoning) signaled early; tightening via rings merging with nascent light narrows to crystallized insight under Accumulative lens. Agency in stone toss forecloses contemplation-only path; cost felt in vanishing rings and daybreak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacred mundane emerges organically from ring stanzas (leaf as "resilient adaptation"); final image reweights premise without moralizing—"mend glass not as chore, but as covenant." Resonant non-literal answer to value in transience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (light as "liquid starlight," reflections as narrative) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks at revelation ("Clarity settled in her bones"). Purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("*plink* punctuated the silence"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in dense figuratives ("spectral colors wove... threads of liquid starlight") risks muddle but pattern-taught as glazier lens; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier craft, pond divination, and dawn optics transforms mundane ritual into profound CR; risk in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry—"read between the lines of this aqueous script" feels inevitable.</comment>
