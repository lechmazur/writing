<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through dream dive, compelling letter choice with embodied tear as cost; interiority concrete via hearth warmth absorption. Minor lack of contradictory impulses limits to very strong; competence overshadows struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in rainbow refraction reweighting globe's meaning; orientation anchored by para 1. Felt cost legible in tear freezing before final understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and melted globe constrain focus/dive and charge final rainbow image; sensory selection (guttering flames, misting breath) mirrors reverence. Purposeful cold pressures embodiment without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage pure love) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cameo revelation narrowing grief to joy; agency in inward dive forecloses trauma path. Cost felt in lingering absorption before unburdening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of enduring love via dream windows emerges organically, resonant non-literal answer in rainbow affirming shared truth; final image reweights wreckage motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature of reverent lyricism ("borrowed starlight"); rhythmic control modulates from inward current to dawn affirmation. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery (ice walls hold memory); minor scaffold from cumulative parentheticals dulls slightly without obscuring closure. Varied rhythm, no loops in peak dream beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diver ghost whisperer transforming crash relic into love vessel; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Dream-cameo angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
