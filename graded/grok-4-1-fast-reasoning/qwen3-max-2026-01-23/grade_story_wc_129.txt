<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft into community drives micro-choices like offering partnership, with embodied "luminescent ache" transforming via relational pressure; Kael applies relevant secondary pressure. Minor diagnostic label ("boldly sympathetic") avoids heavier penalty as it precedes action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from solitude to shared search and discovery; resonant reconfiguration closure lands on-page at dedication with felt emotional cost in foreclosed isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain search choices and charge final belonging image; sensory selectivity (chiming branches, liquid starlight) mirrors internal weaving without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant belonging stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via Kael partnership and tag discovery, forcing dedication agency with relational vulnerability cost legible at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Webs/roots motif emerges organically from particulars, reweighting isolation into connection at "graft has taken root" without moralizing; final chord offers non-literal thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("luminescent ache") biases noticing with rhythmic control; stable single POV, natural subtextual dialogue distinguishes voices without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel momentum; dense figuration ("solidified light") pattern-taught for accumulative mode but borders overwriting in discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fantasy orchard/reed quest transforms belonging trope through specific glyph/search synthesis; risk-taking in lyric accumulation feels inevitable at closure.</comment>
