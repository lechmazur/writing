<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's ache drives patient endurance to revelation, embodied in tears and breath stilling; internal conflict subtle but shown in reckoning with grief versus gratitude. Minor slip: no simultaneous contradictory impulses in a pivotal action like pressing the glass. Earned change forecloses doubt with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to dawn revelation (light striking glass at cum.131), yielding CR closure where flowers' truth reconfigures premise with legible grief-cost in tears (cum.217). Orientation anchored by cum.28; single tightening via hidden layers emerging suffices. Lens holds cleanly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber pavilion's honey-tinted glass and eastern window fragment constrain dawn timing and charge final image (painting under its embrace, cum.255). Sensory details (cool leaded surface, golden ray piercing mist) selective via artist's eye. Evolving snow melt mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveiling nocturnal flowers' truth) signaled early (cum.42), tightens accumulatively as light reveals layers (cum.148), narrowing to emotional reckoning with cost in umbral tenderness (cum.199). Endurance agency tests patience; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shadow-honoring beauty emerges via glass layers and flowers' covenant (cum.177), resonant CR in painting echoing constellations (cum.245) reweighting without moral. Particulars like postcards and crocus avoid platitudes; ambiguity in "reckon" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature artist-specific (pigment-dusted hands, light on etchings). Voice modulates rhythmically with dawn hush, diction biased to blooms/light. Purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion (e.g., "sky bled from indigo to rose"); rhythm varies, no loops obscuring cause (ignore cum. artifacts). Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (cum.120-148) during peak but pattern-taught and legible; no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of etched-glass revelation transforming artist-grandmother legacy into CR on shadowed beauty; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. Postcards/window irreplaceably ground ingenuity from early setup.</comment>
