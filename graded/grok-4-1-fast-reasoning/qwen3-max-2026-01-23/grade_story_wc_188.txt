<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied craft memory and defiance of hopelessness compels choices like chanting and lighting the rag; final vow earned by revelation. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal mosaic scene, muting internal conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure: "oppressive gravity of hopelessness dissolve, replaced by the buoyant weight of purpose." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; legible cost in spent knot relic etching vision into soul.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming fortress and starless hush constrain revelation, with jasmine/moonflowers mirroring internal shift; recurring mosaic tiles charge final image of defiant grace. Sensory hierarchy sharpens via ambient awareness, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, tightens texturally at mosaic emergence narrowing to blueprint vow; agency in filtering flame forecloses doubt with knot's cost. Entry lacks initial opposition beyond dark, but revelation crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope as seed emerges organically from mosaic "Hope is a seed planted in darkness" and sky-mosaic vow, reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image of carrying light into dark offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "filter the fortress’s sensory tapestry" sustains single-POV consistency; rhythm modulates from hum to swelling chant under revelation pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "liquid memory" propels accumulative texture, varying rhythm supports hush-to-bloom cadence. Minor overwriting density in opening sensory cascade slightly blurs propulsion before chant anchors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks craft, mosaic blueprint, and "serious playfulness" transforms trope of quest into textural revelation; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
