<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's precognitive forgetfulness creates embodied contradiction—visions ignite then vanish, compelling micro-choices like marker placements with throat-tight clinging. Final endurance of ritual despite receding tide earns closure with felt cost of hollow longing. No safety-hedging; flaws drive devotion without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via vision-marker cycles to Charged Poise closure where sound manifests then fades, reconfiguring purpose amid markers' glow. Orientation anchors early ("fog sculpture garden," Elara's boots on gravel). Cost legible in "hollow shape of longing" before purpose crystallizes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog garden constrains via shifting forms (e.g., vintage camera of "condensed sorrow"), driftwood supplies markers that guide to chair climax. Sensory hierarchy (creak sound, damp gravel whispers) reflects Elara's echo-clinging bias. Final mist-chair charges image, evolving causally with ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate creak amid forgetting) signaled early, deepens via vision flashes narrowing to markers' ritual. Agency in placements forces trade-off (forgetting erodes wholeness post-climax). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in receding tide erasing grandfather's memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Clinging to echoes emerges via particulars (visions, tapes, markers), final "driftwood markers, standing firm" reweights devotion against oblivion without moralizing. Resonance from ritual's endurance, inviting ambiguity of endless chase. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in echo/smoke-cupped visions. Prose texture modulates rhythmically (short vision bursts amid flowing ritual). No head-hopping; diction biased to sensory ghosts fits junkyard prophet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "chalk hovering, she hesitated" advances emotion/action), rhythm varies for ear. Figurative density overwrites slightly in peak vision beats ("supernova clarity"), docking from 9-band without obscuring creak closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fog-mist sculptures, forgetful precog, tape-hush into fresh ritual cartography; driftwood markers transform trope of loss. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
