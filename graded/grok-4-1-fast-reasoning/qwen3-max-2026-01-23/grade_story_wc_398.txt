<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation shines in her confession tying personal loss to guidance, earning the couple's shifts; Clara and Liam gain depth via embodied memories like vigil nights and wild roses. Minor slip: secondaries border archetypal in sparse interiority, but micro-choices under pressure (hand drifting, fingers unclenching) reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to Charged Poise closure in cottage light and Elara lingering; orientation anchored by bus rumble and pavilion in first paragraph. One tightening in shared silence to hands touching reweights relational stake with solitude cost felt in Elara's final reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vineyard micro-setting constrains via Cabernet-Viognier graft parallel shaping pivotal guidance choice; amber pavilion glows in dusk, charges final sentinel image. Sensory selectivity (rustle, tears through dust) mirrors emotional thaw without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mismatch reconciliation signaled early, escalates accumulatively through parallel density to admissions narrowing options; agency in couple's micro-choices (unclenching, drifting hand) with relational cost. Final image crystallizes poise with felt invitation over ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mismatches as invitations emerges organically from vine graft and letter, resonating in final cottage path rebuild; subtext in silences and gestures avoids binaries. Minor echo in Elara's "destined mismatches" line slightly articulates thesis, but image reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Elara-limited POV with perceptual signature in nature metaphors (roots seeking water); sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Liam's cracked voice). Rhythmic modulation peaks in "fingers unclenching like buds trusting spring," heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload in opening ("cedar beams glowing like liquid honey") slightly muddles early propulsion; no loops, strong verbs propel to closure image. Elevated diction fits lyrical voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard sentinel bridging mismatches via graft parallel transforms trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in burned letter reprise charging solitude as purpose.</comment>
