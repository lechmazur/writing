<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's interiority shines in embodied remorse like tears tracing grime and cold sorrow flooding his chest, earning the absorption of pain at climax. Contradictory impulses from past recklessness fuel micro-choices like placing orchid and stone. Minor label reliance on "fiercely gentle" slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual gestures build to resonant reconfiguration: wisp dissolves after silver veins bloom on card, with legible cost in "cold sorrow flooded the hole." Single scene anchors orientation early in gravel path and moss glow. Closure decisively reconfigures souls with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard vividly constrains ritual via moss-furred altar and roots cradling bones, mirroring internal states through Kael's interactions. Sensory selection (phosphorescent glow, dripping elegies) reflects urgency and POV bias. Final transformation of orchard charges image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to barter for Elara's peace escalates accumulatively via ritual density to wisp confrontation, narrowing to absorption trade-off. Agency in tracing symbols and offering card drives deepening with visible cost in ragged breath and heavy body. One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wounds-to-wisdom emerges organically from ritual particulars like berry memory and silver-scarred card, reweighting bartered destinies without statement. Final mosaic-patched hole offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity in "work of mending souls...never finished."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: sacred geometry in roots and covenant in light. Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, peaking crisply at "The wisp flowed into the light." No head-hopping; purposeful compression pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "roots became earth’s veins, bones became solemn witnesses." Purposeful lyric repetition of "inlaying" taught early avoids loops; minor figurative density in ritual beats coherent without muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, closure crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb ritual bartering transforms redemption tropes via tactile remorse and silver-veined card. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, with premise's inevitability in orchard's exhale. Non-obvious angle on soul-mending feels singular.</comment>
