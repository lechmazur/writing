<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's defiance rooted in apprentice knowledge compels poetry choices under Borin's pressure, with gentle confrontation revealing contradictory mercy. Final concession earned by her micro-choices forecloses simplistic ritual with relational cost. Crowd reactions add pressure without diluting her drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry stanzas build density of facets, breaking unified grief pattern into recognition. Borin's emergence tightens to confrontation; closure as RR (Charged Poise in amended ritual) reconfigures forgiveness with conceptual cost in "grace earned through fractured light." Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Canyon echoes amplify every poem line, constraining and charging Elara's method; bone towers and misted spire evolve from veil to canvas in final image. Sensory hierarchy (hush, ripples, glow) reflects rising urgency through her POV. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract truth pre-ritual) signaled early; poetry ripples and Borin clash deepen via accumulating recognitions, narrowing to concession that forecloses erasure. Agency in sessions tests unity vs. complexity; cost legible in softened faces and lifted weight before dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forgiveness reweighted from monolithic to multifaceted via refracted images (bread-sharing, foreman's dread), culminating in tapestry symphony without stated moral. Subtext in echoes transforming anger to longing; final image non-literal answer to complexity's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable on Elara, perceptual bias in ink-fingers and mischievous glint. Dialogue subtext-laden ("Unity... second collapse"); rhythm modulates from hush to resonant rise. Distinct voices: Elara poetic, Borin tight declarative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (e.g., "petrified prayers," "fractured light") taught early, propelling accumulative beats without loops. Minor overwriting in opening figurative stack slightly dulls initial propulsion, but closure image crystalline. Varied syntax, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fantasy ossuary refracts literal bridge-fall into truth-spectrum, transforming redemption trope via acoustic poetry. Bold risk in poetic structure heightens stakes; "refracted poems" turn inevitable from setup.</comment>
