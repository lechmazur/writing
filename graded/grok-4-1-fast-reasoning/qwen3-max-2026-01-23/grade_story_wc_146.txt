<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's infinite patience embodies contradictory impulses—tremors urge haste, but she holds precise rhythm—earning the final sync with the town's heartbeat. Interiority concrete via tuning fork's thrum and boot vibrations. Micro-choices like triplet at well reveal value hierarchy with visible cost of fragility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footfall density builds restoration pattern to cadence shift at "final dissonance snap—a deep hum vibrating her bones." On-page Charged Poise closure reconfigures decay-to-harmony with patience's felt cost. Orientation anchored early at archway; one tightening via spiral intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobblestones constrain steps, archway charges final pulse; recurring fork/stones as micro-setting mirror internal rhythm. Sensory hierarchy (ripples, scents, embers) selective via Elara's attunement, evolves causally (moss retreats, water rises). Spatial choreography clear through walk sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert collapse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via rhythm shifts narrowing haste option. Agency in deliberate steps forecloses shatter-risk with on-page cost: "haste would shatter the fragile resonance." Climax spiral forces trade-off, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of intentional rhythm restoring balance emerges from particulars like woven echoes, reweighted in final "rhythm had become the town’s eternal heartbeat" without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in her onward path, inviting reflection on endless valleys. Subtext in translucent figures' fade avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in silences-between-heartbeats noticing. Rhythmic syntax modulates with steps: short taps build to spiraling grace. Prose texture as character—lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory propulsion (e.g., "Tap. A soft, resonant contact—the seed note") without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies read-aloud, metaphors consistent (silver threads, phantom ember) in pattern-taught mode. No artifacts dull closure hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms ghost town trope via footstep-rhythm mechanics, growing inevitable from Elara's attunement. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes through accumulative hush-to-hum. Fresh synthesis of patience, memory, sound feels organic, not templated.</comment>
