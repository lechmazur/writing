<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's calm traits root motivation and enable ritual choices, with embodied tears and steady hands showing contradictory regret-acceptance in the vision beat; minor therapy-speak like "diffuse its sting" slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density to memory shard and cadence shift at "cerulean regret" realization; closure as RR/Charged Poise with legible emotional cost in tears and smoothed guilt, constraint of lace method persistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bonsai grove and lace motifs as micro-settings constrain ritual choices and charge final pruning image; sensory details like steaming granite mirror internal placid tide without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding apology color signaled early, deepens via vision reversal changing knowledge to acceptance; agency in tracing lace forecloses despair path with tearful cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of blending past colors emerges organically from ritual-vision-bonsai arc; resonant final whisper to tree reweights without moralizing, minor slip in near-explicit "We carry all colors" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of observant calm; rhythmic diction modulates from ritual buildup to quiet release, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but paraphrase loops around "rhythmically placid" and "diffuse" (e.g., multiple regret phrasings) create minor artifacts dulling vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lace-woven ritual unlocking chromatic memory transforms healing trope; compass-lace mechanics inevitable in hindsight, risk of lyric fantasy heightens closure resonance.</comment>
