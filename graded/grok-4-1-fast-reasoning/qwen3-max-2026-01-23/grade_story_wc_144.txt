<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as sacred duty intensifies compellingly under time pressure, with micro-choices like warming resin revealing values. Interiority embodied via skin warmth and vibrations; blindness as strength shown through hands and water method. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward serene competence over internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: diagnosis via water refraction therefore patch, culminating in RR closure as drone awakens and releases amid ship's departure. Orientation anchored early in shop/depot; cost legible in harbor bell toll forcing absolute focus. Single scene causality tight, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Water basin as micro-setting constrains diagnosis ("sharp, dark fissure in the golden flow") and charges final image ("fingers trailing through the cool, flowing water"). Sensory details (mist pulse, oil scent, vibrations) selective via blind POV, mirroring internal calm. Depot evolves with anchor lift cheers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timely drone repair) signaled early, tightens via refraction diagnosis narrowing options and bell toll raising cost. Agency in methodical patch forecloses failure path; escalation as density increase under Accumulative lens. Cost felt in "harbor bell tolled its final warning" amid unwavering focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restoration through deep listening emerges organically from water/light method and blindness, answered non-literally in final basin touch reweighting perception. Resonance from particulars like fractured crystal to unbroken amber flow; avoids moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable blind POV with perceptual signature: tactile/auditory bias ("vibration traveling through stone and soul"). Lyrical voice modulates rhythm with intensity, prose texture distinct in syntax evoking calm flow. No elision or head-hopping; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively, high density with multi-job lines; propulsion strong in repair beats. Figurative density overwrites slightly ("liquid rainbows," "magnetic calm" repeated), but coherent and voice-motivated without muddle at closure ("drone’s whir merged with the ship’s farewell horn"). Minimal loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: blind artisan's water-refraction repair of hummingbird drone in mist depot transforms trope via specific sensory logic. Risky POV heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight; no derivatives, bold perceptual angle on restoration.</comment>
