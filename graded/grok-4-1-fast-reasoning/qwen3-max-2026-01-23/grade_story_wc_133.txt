<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's insomnia as vigil and impulse to follow trails show contradictory solitude vs. seeking, embodied in descent and exchange; final sleep earned by legacy handoff with felt cost of brooch's release. Elara applies pressure as living history. Minor diagnostic tone in realizations slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory trails and memories density-build to CR closure in heartstone warmth and sleep's pull, reweighting insomnia as purposeful with legible cost in "profound exhaustion... purpose fulfilled." Orientation anchored early in tower/island. One tightening at Elara's reveal narrows isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal flats, rain trails, and thrift constrain path to ravine, charging final heartstone image; sensory hierarchy (salt, mud, sea glass) POV-filtered through painter's eye. Mudflats evolve with tide, mirroring internal shift. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh meaning from survival ache) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via trails to Elara's revelation/exchange, forcing renunciation of brooch/solitude with visible cost in tear-traced closure. Agency in following/painting/sleeping forecloses hiding path. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-Elara.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-current emerges organically from brooch exchange and rain threads weaving timelines; final image ("rain trails leading... home") resonant CR reweighting vigil without moralizing. Subtext in wry devotion avoids platitudes. Particulars like cairn/Anya anchor insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with painterly perceptual signature (pigments from coral, gleaming tears); voice rhythmic, modulating from haggard to graced sleep. Elara's dialogue wry/subtextual, distinct idiom. Clean free indirect; no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring tide's rhythm; purposeful lyricism in "silver threads weaving sky to earth." Minor artifact: "wryly earnest" looped 4x without fresh modulation dulls slightly. No closure-touching loops; ignores bracketed counts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-water-wars painter following rain-veins to timeline collision; brooch-heartstone exchange transforms legacy trope via tactile warmth/sleep. Risky lyric accumulation heightens awe without gimmick. No template echoes.</comment>
