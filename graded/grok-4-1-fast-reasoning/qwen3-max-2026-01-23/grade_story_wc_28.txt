<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (honor agony vs. elders' pragmatism) act through micro-choices like brushing ash and inscribing; release from trap earned by tessera embedding with felt emotional cost. Interiority concrete via tessera anchor and embodied flashbacks. Final palm on beam reveals values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ash whispers to mosaic voids, culminating in Charged Poise RR at tessera embedding ("profound release washed through her") with legible cost (memories as chains to compass points). Single scene, orientation anchored early; constraint (chipped stone) shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone and tessera as micro-settings constrain renaming choice and charge final image (tessera "flash like a captured star"). Sensory hierarchy (ash scent, boot steps) POV-filtered, purposeful; shattered sky evolves with sun pierce, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim plaza from trap) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via negative-space reading to renaming agency; cost unmistakable in memory reconfiguration. Elders' mutter adds secondary pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (mercy as strength) emerges organically from mosaic refinement and renaming; final image (children's laughter, palm on beam) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting "aberrant mercy" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (voids as "bird in flight"); rhythmic control modulates from deliberate grace to release wash. Lyrical diction purposeful, biased to resilience in breakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "charcoal...inscribed new letters"); rhythm varies with scene (slow/reverent to lighter spirit). Minor figurative density in peak renaming serves pattern without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire reclamation via negative-space reading transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at tessera flash.</comment>
