<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory "cheerful gloom" embodied throughout, with micro-choices like planting seeds revealing values under pressure; earned shift in final tears/smile moment forecloses doubt with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via building tests to CR closure—"Paths disappear from completion"—reweighting voids as potentials with legible conceptual cost in receding tide realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode cave's crystals/paths constrain seed-planting choices and charge final pulsing walls; sensory light/emotion colors mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) tightens accumulatively through three tests narrowing conjecture to truth; cost felt in fragile timeframe and emotional parting during last path's fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory's sacred cycle emerges organically from tests; final "compass in her heart" image resonantly reweights release without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (memory-tracing bias); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from urgent tests to peaceful cadence without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "dew on a web"); rhythmic variety propels, minor density in peak tests avoids muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory geode/finch seeds/crater glass transforms trope into inevitable cycle discovery; risk in lyric fantasy pays off in charged closure.</comment>
