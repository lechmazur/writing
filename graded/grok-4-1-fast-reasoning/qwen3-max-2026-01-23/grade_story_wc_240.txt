<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's spatial gift and grief create concrete interiority and contradictory impulses (technical conquest vs. emotional permeability), earning the tear of release at climax. Kael's shared loss applies relational pressure, forcing micro-choice in dialogue. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "emotional perimeter" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to Kael's approach, dialogue deepens stake, laser test delivers Charged Poise closure with legible emotional cost in "tear traced Elara’s cheek—not of sadness, but release." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mycelial walls and glowing fungi constrain the laser test choice and charge final image, mirroring internal permeability. Sensory hierarchy (earthy scent, cerulean light) reflects Elara's spatial bias; evolves with dawn sliver. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prototype test as grief metaphor) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Kael's words ("Learn its frequency"), forcing button-press agency with felt cost in grief's transformation. One deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Permeability theme emerges organically from laser-through-mycelium and grief dialogue, resonating in final image without moralizing. Subtext in "familiar stranger" connection invites ambiguity on loss integration. Mild thematic echo in Kael's "physics of letting go" line dings slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with spatial perceptual signature ("mind effortlessly charted"); voice modulates rhythmically from reverence to release. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Kael persuades, Elara reveals), distinct idioms. Clean free indirect under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to climax; metaphors like "quiet wildfire" purposeful without muddle. Minor repetition ("permeable") but no loops obscuring cause/effect. Propulsion peaks clean in laser beam sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mushroom-farm security and grief physics transforms tropes via spatial intuition and living barriers. Risky metaphor integration feels inevitable in laser test; no derivative echoes.</comment>
