<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "quiet thesis" compels ritual choices with embodied emotion peaking in tears; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in ritual beat, but endurance reframes insomnia credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from ritual to daydream to nurse's note; CR closure lands on-page with tears as legible emotional cost in "profound confirmation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse and moon constrain ritual choices ("moonlight struck the brush’s tip just so"); saffron pigment and bus stop charge final image of shared language.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove kindness remembered) signaled early tightens accumulatively via nurse's "listened longer" note, foreclosing doubt with felt cost of vigil in tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lost languages emerges organically through memory, painting, and nurse's addition; final note reweights premise non-literally as "new word to the language."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of sensory hope ("damp soil and quiet possibility"); rhythmic control modulates from ritual whisper to emotional swell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm; minor loops in "saffron quiet" and "quiet" phrasing slightly dull propulsion without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-brush ritual proving kindness via paintings transforms quiet insomnia trope; risk in abstract "languages" paid off in nurse's concrete response.</comment>
