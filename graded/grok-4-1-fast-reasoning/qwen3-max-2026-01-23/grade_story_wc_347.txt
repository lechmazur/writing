<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reluctant motivation rooted in blood-oath drives precise micro-choices like nut-plucking; contradictory impulses (flight vs duty) embodied in final "every instinct begged her to flee" but ritual endures with cost foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: search-assembly-note linkages culminate in DC closure as birds mark path, reconfiguring options before frost with felt cost of ongoing duty in "she would repeat this ritual tomorrow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentinel Tree bark constrains nut retrieval; mechanical birds as recurring micro-setting enable dust-impressions, charging final patrols image without tourist catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost) tightens via nut-find to assembly agency; frost crystals glittering post-save force stance crystallization with reluctance cost legible in shoulders relaxing only after family bows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Graceless beauty theme emerges via crude assembly saving lives; final "stubborn grace" in nut-turn and light-from-absence reweights reluctance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in "offhandedly exact" precision and frost-glitter bias; rhythmic control modulates from urgency to poise without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via image-action fusion like "vents along bellies releasing shimmering dust"; varied syntax breathes with scene, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork birds, pea-nut command, frost-curse orchard transforms tropes; nut-turn payoff feels inevitable from blueprint constraint.</comment>
