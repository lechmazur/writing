<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary interiority through chess-specific embodiment of guilt—"each knot a lesson he’d neglected"—with contradictory remorse and fierce concentration acting simultaneously; micro-choices like threading knots reveal values under pressure, earning the final peace with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from fidgeting to winnowing, culminating in on-page RR (chime shatters hush, village awakens) with legible conceptual cost: "untangled his own guilt"; orientation anchored immediately in Stillwater.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "raindrops hung motionless like scattered diamonds" and baker’s flour constrain choices (salvaged thread) and charge final image of awakening; POV-filtered through chess eyes integrates setting into action without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of atonement tightens via decoding revelation mirroring Scholar’s Mate defense, narrowing options with embodied cost ("tears of remorse welled but could not fall"); agency in relentless winnowing drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grace-forged wisdom emerges organically from thread-as-move particulars, reweighted in final silver king image offering non-literal answer to guilt without moralizing; resonant counter-reading of conquest vs. protection lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct chess-perceptual signature ("chess-trained eyes saw only the border’s chaos"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to symphony without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"winnowed relentlessly: discarding threads frayed by weather"—varies rhythm purposefully; minor figurative density coherent and pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess atonement in frozen-time puzzle transforms stasis trope via irreplaceable thread-decoding; risk in lyric Accumulative build heightens stakes to earned "fierce repose."</comment>
