<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recluse's tranquilly perceptive trait roots motivation in concrete observations, earning closure realization that his gaze completes the covenant; embodied wonder via dust patterns and ghost tremors shows particular interiority without epiphanies. Ghost backstory anchors via contextual clues, compelling higher-stakes ritual. Final nod and release foreclose solitary duty with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from oasis description to new clue of Elias's direct gaze ("eyes holding quiet resolution"), tightening to RR/Charged Poise closure where ghost dissolves with sigh, reweighting covenant as bridge. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in recluse's deepened joy versus prior solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Box as micro-setting constrains ritual and charges final image ("catching the moonlight now—a vessel not of ghosts, but of remembrance"); wasteland-oasis contrast mirrors internal states through selective sensory (brittle lavender, dancing rainbows). Details evolve causally with light softening ghost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unspoken words) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening clues to gaze turn, narrowing to stance crystallization; agency in sustained gaze/ritual forecloses regret chain with ghost's release cost. Pivotal new clue beat forces trade-off in purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silent love's endurance emerges organically from box ritual and clues, resonant CR in ghost's nod/release reweighting covenant without moralizing; final image ("colors whispering what words never could") answers preservation question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (deciphering "angle of a fallen hive") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise, diction controlled and biased toward mute observation. No head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but dense figurative clusters ("mute eloquence saturated the air") border overwriting in mid-beats without pattern payoff, slightly dulling propulsion; no loops or artifacts touch closure image of soft click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghosts, beekeeping oasis, and stained glass covenant transforms spectral trope into accumulative grace; risk in mute protagonist heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in box's evolving light.</comment>
