<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied emotions via flaring scars and trembling chest excel, earning the final devotion pour; repetitive "purposefully curious" borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scar-density buildup to nexus; RR closure lands cleanly when clipping stitches rift, cost legible in "pouring every linked scar."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glade's scars and trees constrain path choices holistically; cobalt shadows and oak trunk anchor and mirror internal fractures without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively through successive links narrowing to rift; agency peaks in pressing clipping, but cost embodiment thins slightly pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sapling's maze-leaves reweight scars-as-map into growing covenant, resonant without moralizing; theme emerges organically from linking acts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases toward scars/whispers; rhythmic modulation heightens from "raced with anxious elation" to peaceful hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies propulsively, but "anxious elation" paraphrase loop (three instances) dulls peak density; no muddled metaphors touch closure sapling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scar-linking as painful cartography transforms covenant trope into fresh relational nexus; risk of lyric fantasy synthesis inevitable in hindsight via clipping payoff.</comment>
