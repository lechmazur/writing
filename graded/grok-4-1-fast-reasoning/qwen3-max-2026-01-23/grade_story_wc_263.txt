<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in memory flashes like grandmother’s voice and scent; contradictory grief/fear impulses act via tracing despite pain, earning surrender. Minor label-speak ("catharsis," "shadowed rapture") borders therapy abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density tightens from archway whisper to meteor traces culminating in Charged Poise RR at "surrender completely," with felt cost of embracing pain in tears-blurred realization. Single scene anchors orientation by para 2; one deepening via unfolding "unwritten calendar" suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Astrolabe and archway constrain choices (lift/trace, step into shadow triggers phrase); aurora evolves from witness to "compassionate rose" charging final palm-rest image. Sensory hierarchy (cold bite vs. inner warmth) reflects POV urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through star-traces narrowing to rest; agency in surrender forecloses struggle path with legible emotional cost in "cage was of her own making." One tightening charges closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness via "remembered stardust" emerges organically from traces to final "creativity flows from wholeness"; resonant CR reweights grief/joy binary in walking image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (unspoken words in wind/stone/stars); rhythmic modulation peaks in short "Rest" surrender beat, diction biased to dreamer's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric repetition ("traced," "stardust"); minor paraphrase loops in star-trace beats ("floods surged," "coalesced") dull momentum slightly, but no closure harm or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "unspoken words" gift and emotional "stardust" transforms grief ritual into "unwritten calendar" timeline; risk in lyric accumulation heightens catharsis without gimmick.</comment>
