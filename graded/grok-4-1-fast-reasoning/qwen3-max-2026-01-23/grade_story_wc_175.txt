<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's esoteric realist traits drive concrete micro-choices like pausing for petal light and splinting the wing, revealing contradictory ritual vs. compassion impulses; final endurance of impermanence earned with tear's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density to "cadence shattered" break and charged poise closure in butterfly's signal/departure; cost legible in tear and loosening roots reconfiguring purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy floor and cloud-grass constrain structures' impermanence, charging final breeze-untie image; selective sensory filter (bioluminescence, wind whisper) mirrors Elara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to honor histories tightens via monarch arrival forcing splint trade-off, narrowing ritual; agency in "infinite tenderness" knot with tear cost unmistakable under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moth-wing splint reweights overlooked histories theme non-literally; resonance from particulars like whispered names to wind's untying, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("silent language of root systems") stable in single POV; rhythm interrupts purposefully, modulating to quiet completion without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels (e.g., short "The grotto held its breath"); purposeful figurative pattern (diamond dew to spun sugar) coherent, no loops or scaffold dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moth-wing splint ingeniously bridges celebrated/forgotten histories, transforming last-butterfly trope; risky lyric synthesis inevitable via transient knots.</comment>
