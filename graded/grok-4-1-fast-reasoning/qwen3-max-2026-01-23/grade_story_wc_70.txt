<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in preserving wonder drives the riddle reveal; involuntary truthfulness forces non-evasive response to Dr. Aris. Interiority embodied in "warmth spreading through his chest" after realization. Minor flaw: internal conflict mostly told via backstory summaries rather than simultaneous impulses in pivotal reveal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from silence and box to riddle resolution with CR closure via Dr. Aris's "blinded by beauty" epiphany reweighting failure as awe. Orientation anchored early in tower scene. One tightening via riddle unfolds options poetically; cost legible in transformed "sterile failure" into parable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidi an lens and nectar dusk constrain the core failure perception, charging final "stars pricked the indigo" image. Sensory details selective via Kael's priorities (missing hum, scarred desk). Tower as cathedral subtly guides reveal choreography without postcard dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal truth preserving wonder) signaled early, tightens via riddle forcing poetic over data response under Accumulative lens. Agency in gesturing to box; cost in foreclosing "cold data" for legacy method, charging Dr. Aris's redesign philosophy. Coherent pressure from her plea narrows evasion options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder over efficiency emerges organically from riddle's payoff, reweighting blackout as "parable of humility." Final image of dormant drones "with wiser eyes" offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Minor thematic echo in Kael's "technology must bow" line borders statement but ties to prior causality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (sky/science cathedral). Dialogue natural/subtextual: Dr. Aris's plea vs. Kael's candid poetry; distinct rhythms. Lyrical diction consistent, modulates from descriptive hush to softened revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but overwriting via stacked figuration ("liquid gold and deep violet shadows," "diamond dust") in opening lacks restraint, mildly dulling early propulsion. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies purposefully. Minor register elevation in riddle reading sustains voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drones blinded by "nectar dusk" refraction via grandfather's riddle transforms tech-failure trope into wonder-preservation parable. Risky poetic method (matchbox poetry) heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable premise angle on sky vs. machines.</comment>
