<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strengths in concrete interiority and trait-specific perception, like tracing faded rivers; motivation intensifies to stewardship without unearned epiphany. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footage comparison deepens pattern to CR closure at "The map’s tear was not a flaw but a threshold"; cost legible in carrying "weight of understanding," options reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vault's damp walls and fresco constrain analysis (shadow overlays Orion), charge final image of rain tracing "new paths down ancient stone"; sensory hierarchy POV-specific, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret silence) signaled early, deepens via 1954/1989 shadow divergence; agency in patient restoration forecloses conquest path with stewardship cost. Entry to 8.8+ gate met by felt price charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as vessel emerges organically from shadow alignment and map tear; final "pass the whisper forward" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "language of erosion"; stable close-POV, rhythmic modulation under revelation (soft breath absorbed); purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; minor figurative density early ("rain had wept," "watercolor memories") coherent via erosion motif, no loops or muddle at revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography/solstice shadows transforms relic trope; risk in lyric silence motif heightens stakes, inevitable at "sacred geometry" realization.</comment>
