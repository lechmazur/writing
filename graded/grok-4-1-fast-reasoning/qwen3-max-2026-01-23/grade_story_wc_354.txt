<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief/tears vs. stubborn drive) act in scene, embodied via dust-traced tears and thumb on dent; final renunciation of bitterness as exile-redefinition earned by correlations with cost in "sorrow of lost students." Interiority concrete and chess-specific; no unearned epiphanies flatten pivotal stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from hum to spike/stillness, yielding CR closure where "dent now a signature of resilience" reconfigures exile with legible emotional cost in tears/ache; orientation anchored early at nexus/convergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Worry stone and nexus (hum in teeth, luminous basalt) constrain choices (precise positioning, tactile anchor) and charge final image ("dent in his pocket a compass"); sensory hierarchy POV-filtered via chess cadences, vivid/selective without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty/clarify covenant via nexus) signaled early, tightens texturally via spike (prince's fist) to stillness (fidelity), narrowing to endurance with cost in tears/"hopeful melancholy"; agency in translating forces reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in fracture) emerges via dent/stone parallels and correlations, resonant CR in "shadow defining light" reweights premise without moral; final stars-as-chess offers non-literal answer, charged by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (chess-strategic lens on textures: "foundational cadence of chess"); rhythmic diction modulates intensity (subsonic hum to "serene certainty"); purposeful elevation fits tutor's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short spike sentences amid flow); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("shadow defining light") purposeful in lyric mode; propulsion peaks in stillness void without overwriting dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Geomagnetic/chess synthesis transforms exile trope into fresh CR (silence as fidelity); risk-taking in textural correlations feels inevitable, heightens stakes via nexus constraints without gimmickry.</comment>
