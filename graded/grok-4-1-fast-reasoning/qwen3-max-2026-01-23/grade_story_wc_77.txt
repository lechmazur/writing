<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: advisor's micro-choice to "force himself to see not a monster, but a child’s forgotten teddy bear" embodies contradictory impulses (fear vs conquest) with visible cost to his cursed void. Minor slip: final "compassionate cunning" summary slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent Causal lens closure: fear-thing's "My weakness… is being seen" delivers Decisive Change with legible conceptual cost (admission fragility recoils entity). Orientation anchored in first line; single scene linkages tighten seamlessly to mirror-healing image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mirrors and "hallway of distorted mirrors" constrain choices throughout (void repels, flicker reveals), charging final "faint, human outline" image. Sensory details like "sweet rot from spilled candy apples warring with… old blood" selectively heighten repulsive decay under POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear's weakness) signaled early escalates via agency-driven teddy bear lie causing "choked sob," narrowing options to dictionary paradox press with on-page cost (emptiness as bait). Causal tightening forces entity confession under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of dread's fragile heart emerges organically from paradox tactics and confession, resonant in final "gentle silence where a monster once whispered" reweighting premise without moral. Particulars like dictionary notes avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (e.g., "air thick with repulsive allure") biased to decay motifs; dialogue subtextual as fear-thing "stammers" under press. Voice texture modulates rhythm in climax whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., clasp glow integrates setting/action); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting: stacked figures like "rust and regret… cold as forgotten coins… trapped spirits" in opening slightly muddle but pattern-taught as voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms funhouse haunt via photographic curse and paradox unbosoming, with teddy bear lie turn inevitable from dictionary setup. Bold risk in quiet dissolution heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
