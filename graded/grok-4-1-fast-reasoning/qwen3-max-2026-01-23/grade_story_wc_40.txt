<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in weathered innocence drives patient listening to restoration; embodied tears and peace show emotional progression. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic fragments densify to CR via pattern realization ("Growth was not loud progression but this quiet symphony"); cost legible in tears, ladder climb, and departure from sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn and crystal constrain listening/immersion and charge restoration; selective sensory details (creak, drip, chime) mirror growth theme without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth) escalates accumulatively via fractured sequences deepening to non-human symphony; agency in ear-pressing and crystal return forecloses isolation with felt vindication cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of growth as quiet persistence emerges organically from sonic particulars; final harmonious chord reconfigures fragments into wholeness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical close-third POV stable with sonic-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic diction modulates hush to charged dawn pulse without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel from hush to chord; purposeful sonic textures elevate without muddle or loops, ignoring generator word-count artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sonic crystal as growth archive offers fresh synthesis of library soul and renewal; risk in quiet epiphany heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
