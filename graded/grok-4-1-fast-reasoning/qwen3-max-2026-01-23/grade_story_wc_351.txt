<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in tears and trembling during memory flood; motivation intensifies via entangled settler and Native girl visions, earning transformation with cost of abandoned career. Minor diagnostic slips like "synaptic plasticity" feel clinical but don't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to harmonious hum, delivering Charged Poise closure in gathering warm shards and ascent, with felt cost of bodily protest and life left behind. Orientation anchored early in canyon vigil; one tightening via spiraling memories suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon walls as chronicle constrain ritual choice, mirroring helical pattern; moonlit glow charges mirror shards and final ascent image. Sensory selectivity (silence filling her, wind whispering) reflects urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of excavating dreams tightens via deepening synaptic connections, forcing integration with quaking cost; agency in modifying focus drives under Accumulative lens. Minor abstractness in stakes but closure cost legible in spirit soaring over protesting joints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected dreams emerges organically from memory shards spiraling like double helix, resonant in final chorus of voices; avoids moralizing but "essence of her new vocation" borders overt. Final image reweights engineer-to-archeologist arc without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with helical perceptual signature in spiral arrangements and patterns; rhythmic prose modulates from chaos to crystalline clarity under stress. Elevated diction consistent and voice-motivated for lyrical vigil.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motifs like helix; rhythm varies read-aloud, propelling to closure. Minor paraphrase loops in "modify" and "profound transformation" repeats dull mid-section slightly, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering precision with psychic archaeology via periscope shards transforms trope of self-discovery; risk-taking in ritual premise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via canyon's imprints.</comment>
