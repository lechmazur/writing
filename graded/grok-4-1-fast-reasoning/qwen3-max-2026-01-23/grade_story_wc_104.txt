<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as chained liberator is embodied through decoding under deadline pressure, culminating in earned realization that chains are "roots" (241); patiently strategic trait constrains her to non-violent impedance. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—no shown doubt or fear amid bulldozer roar—reducing peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chained confinement and time pressure because/therefore drive decoding of keys as Orion’s belt (112), panel opening (170), foreman’s bow (223). Closure as Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost legible in chains' revaluation (241) and halted demolition; orientation anchored in first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dust motes, warped floorboards, glass-eyed bears) filter through Elara’s priorities, constraining her three paces to wall seam (150). Recurring piano bench and wall panel guide choices and charge vault reveal; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save vault before noon) signaled early, tightens causally via creeping bulldozer shadow forcing final cipher decode (112); agency in arrow press forecloses destruction with on-page cost of 12-year vigil crystallized (241). One meaningful reversal suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via grace emerges organically from seed-laden arrow and vault reveal shifting crew's stance (196), resonant final image of arrow "banner of quiet victory" (205) reweights legacy without moralizing. Complexity in non-violent impedance avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in dust patterns and sunlight arcs; elevated diction consistent and voice-motivated for lyric tone. No dialogue to judge; psychic distance tightens elegantly at revelation without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure decoding beat ("cipher dissolved... mirrored Orion’s belt" at 112 with prior metaphors), dulling propulsion per overwriting check; minor paraphrase loops ("quiet ember... quiet promise" and "staggering grace" thrice). Rhythms vary but elevated register risks opacity in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of carnival piano keys as celestial map unlocking seed vault transforms tropes of imprisonment/liberation; arrow fletching with grass strands feels inevitable in hindsight, risking bold poetic conceit without gimmickry.</comment>
