<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Spiritually curious trait roots motivation in consistent actions like tracing stars, intensifying to meteor empathy with embodied tear as cost; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal meteor beat, keeping it strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from routine tracing to meteor fragmentation as tightening; CR closure via reflection in lantern ("truth crystallized") reweights vulnerability with legible emotional cost (tear), one deepening sufficient; orientation anchored early in station hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Station dome and lantern constrain choices (placed on viewport for tracing, reflects face at peak); sensory hierarchy (dust motes, starlight, straw whisper) selective via POV reverence; recurring lantern charges final image without forcing symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (strength in vulnerability) signaled early, tightens via meteor sync forcing deeper empathy; agency in sustained tracing forecloses isolation with felt cost (tear, open heart); pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as resilience emerges from particulars (star dissolution, tear, lantern reflection) without statement; final image ("light persists within vulnerability") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting stillness; earned via concrete struggle, avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sermons in silence, scripture in starlight); rhythmic prose modulates from reverent hush to meteor intensity; no dialogue; diction purposeful and biased to spiritual curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "vulnerability/strength" and "flourishing stillness" across multiple sentences dull density (e.g., totals 92-214 repeatedly rephrase core idea without propulsion); overwriting with stacked metaphors in reflective beats obscures peak momentum; rhythm varies but template echoes evident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor tracing shooting stars transforms trope of overlooked worker into fresh spiritual pilgrimage; lantern reprise and meteor scar synthesize ingenuity organically; risks lyric accumulation heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
