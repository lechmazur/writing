<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in concrete covenant, shown via reverent handling of hearing aid and focus under stillness; curiosity anchors micro-choices like leaning into pulses. Internal steadiness yields earned triumph at Lily's smile, with incidental heroism as credible endurance. No deep contradictory impulses, but traits particularize without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses build from static to message via deepening focus, culminating in RR (mist glows, whispers amplify) with conceptual cost of fortified duty. Orientation anchors early in atrium; single scene tightens meaningfully without shards. Closure image of Elara turning to next case reconfigures her role legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and twilight haze constrain stillness and part dramatically for Lily's arrival, charging final glow. Sensory selectivity (violet haze, corroded circuits, rustle of leaves) filters through Elara's professional gaze. Marble veined like frozen rivers and artifact shelves evolve to mirror reassurance chorus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver vulnerable voice) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pulse resolution narrowing to specific message. Agency in deepened focus and modulated delivery forecloses erasure with felt cost in Lily's tears-to-smile. Tightening coherent under lens; minor abstractness in "sacred tension" before pivotal hearing aid beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Incidental heroism emerges organically from delivery act amplifying atrium voices, reweighting small kindnesses as world-mending without statement. Final image of locket grip and Elara's turning stitches theme via particulars. Ambiguity in "ethereal fabric" lingers plausibly, tying to core concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (traces as pulses, curiosity anchor); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to glow. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden: Elara's cadence assures without overwhelming. Diction poetic yet grounded, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with action; rhythm varies (short pulses amid long descriptive swells). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—e.g., "spider silk" voice fits accumulative texture. Elevated phrasing like "profound reeling hush" purposeful, voice-motivated without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of contact tracing as heart-echo recovery transforms loss trope via object pulses and mist agency. Risky fantasy realism (dead-call hour) heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration of atrium feels inevitable from particulars. No derivatives; voice commits boldly to quiet heroism.</comment>
