<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decipher buildings rooted in tutor's legacy intensifies via revelations, with embodied tears and heart-full shift earning her stewardship; Mrs. Davison's patient wisdom applies relational pressure. Final renunciation of "interrogating stone" for listening shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds revelation density to Charged Poise closure: seal gifted as key, reconfiguring Elara's quest with responsibility cost legible in "cool weight—responsibility and connection intertwined." Single rooftop scene, orientation anchored early (teacup, meteors). Lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop garden sensory vivid and purposeful: meteor flash resolves "brick pattern into the penitentiary’s archway," charging realization and constraining emotional pivot. Seal as micro-setting handled tactilely; jasmine, steam mirror internal softening. No white-room; spatial coherence strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher buildings) signaled early tightens accumulatively via lie revelation, deepening to emotional truth and foreclosing factual chase; agency in listening yields seal with felt relational cost. One meaningful cadence shift suffices; minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate lies emerges organically from seal emblem, penitentiary bricks, and Elara's arc; final image of tracing wax key offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting "interrogate" to stewardship without moralizing. Subtext in gargoyle's "offering" vs. swallowing enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with perceptual bias (noticing bricks, whispers); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from mystery to warmth. Dialogue subtextual ("sugar... first syllable"), natural, goal-driven; distinct voices (Mrs. D's page-soft murmur vs. Elara's interior). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose rhythmic and dense but loops plague ending: paraphrase churn on "patiently nimble," "agreed upon lies," "interrogate stone" across final third dulls propulsion (−1.0). Some figurative density overwrites high-pressure revelation without payoff; clarity holds but scaffold drags closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gargoyle seal offering key transforms "dead languages" trope into fresh emblem of merciful history; rooftop Perseids illuminate penitentiary bricks as tribute, inevitable synthesis of empathy over excavation. Bold lyric accumulative risks pay off in charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
