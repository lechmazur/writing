<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist trait compels etching cycles amid confinement, with contradictory hope driving the rupture absorption; final transformation to gentle peace earned via embodied regret textures without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via proof density building to rupture pattern-break RR (Charged Poise: absorbs moment, seals tear with cost of no escape); orientation anchored in first paragraph, cost legible in "She did not step through."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Infinite staircase and chipped die as micro-settings constrain etching/climbing choices and charge final roll image; sensory selectivity (whispering boots, clicking dice) mirrors internal infinity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture regret texture) signaled early, escalates texturally via decades of proofs to rupture deepening; agency in final carving forecloses escape with felt acceptance cost charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mathematical communion with loss emerges organically from proofs/rupture; final forgiveness proof offers non-literal answer reweighting confinement as sanctuary without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (math-infused noticing of textures/stone); rhythmic prose modulates from grim resolve to tender peace, diction biased toward calculus motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but mild paraphrase loops in final paragraph ("climbed," "chipped die," "proofs") slightly dull closure image without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math proofs rupturing regret in infinite stair transforms perpetual motion trope; bold lyric risk heightens thematic stakes with irreplaceable die motif.</comment>
