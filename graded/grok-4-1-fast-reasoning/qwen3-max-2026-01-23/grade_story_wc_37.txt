<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via "shattered loom" fragments surfacing mid-ritual, compelling higher-stakes singing; final mind-settling earned by memory-song causality, though minor abstract labels like "mosaic mind" slightly dilute peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-tightening via layered songs; on-page RR closure in "woven dawn unfurled" reconfigures stakes with legible emotional cost in "tight bands of despair loosening," no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mica window constrains gaze/ritual and charges final image by blazing dawn; alchemical details like "copper alembics bubbled" tactilely mirror internal renewal without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as songs braid light and memories align, forcing endurance; cost viscerally felt in tears and scars during Heartseed pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-woven renewal emerges organically from song particulars; final dewdrop "miniature sunrise" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward luminous threads/song; rhythmic modulation peaks coherently in swelling melody, stable close-POV with purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "tears traced clean paths... nascent dawn"; purposeful "woven" motif avoids loops, though minor synonym churn in light descriptors (gold/rose/amber) nudges below peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-world alchemy and song-threads transforms renewal trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Heartseed payoff.</comment>
