<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's dry wit and cartographic motivation root choices firmly, with embodied vibration at glass confirming resolve; memories anchor rebellion without flattening pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal revelation beat slightly tempers score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via falcon-condensation-phrasebook convergence to CR closure (crystallized source beneath ice), with patient wait as felt cost legible in "She would wait for dawn" and shadow alignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost constrain dawn drilling and charge final stars image; condensation droplets as micro-setting mirror internal shift, filtering through Elara's atlas bias with tactile precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (river origins) tightens via inward rivulets revelation, narrowing options to drill; agency in pattern deciphering yields conceptual cost of upwelling truth versus academic rebellion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of maps as conversations emerges organically from convergence particulars, with final footnote reweighting origins premise non-literally; avoids platitudes through dog-eared page reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct cartographic perceptual signature ("cartographic correction") and rhythmic modulation sustain close third-person; sparse dialogue ("Noted, colleague") carries wry subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration (ice dust, frost-feathers), but minor figurative density borders overwriting in revelation beat without obscuring CR.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of condensation as inward map and falcon-flight alignment transforms river-source trope into memory-intersection CR; bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
