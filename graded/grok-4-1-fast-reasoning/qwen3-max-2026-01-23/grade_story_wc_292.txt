<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in ancestral honor, intensifying through embodied dread and micro-choices like pressing the nail to the page. Interior contradiction shines in her fragile resolve amid "spongey dread." Technician applies targeted pressure in confrontation, forcing credible change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain excels: nail reveals indentations → coordinates expose sacrifice → warning matches anomaly → evacuation, with on-page closure in ridge-view Charged Poise reconfiguring exile and dread at cost of station. Orientation anchors instantly in station and post-jet stream world. Lens holds causal without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weather station and reef constrain choices, as anomalous pressure flags tsunami path; damp wool, verdigris ink, and bruised sky filter through Elara's cartographic bias. Final ridge image charges closure with receding tide mirroring dread's release. Sensory economy purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy reversal) tightens causally via code revelation narrowing options to urgent evacuation. Confrontation tests agency against technician's skepticism, with seismic confirmation and wave cost legible. One decisive deepening suffices, pressure coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reversible exile emerges organically from coded proof and tsunami parallel, culminating in nail's shift "from relic to relic of redemption" reweighting sacrifice without moralizing. Subtext layers in shanties' disguise and geological anger. Resonance invites ambiguity on haste's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable with perceptual signature in cartographic details like "gull’s shadow falls thrice." Dialogue natural, subtext-laden: Elara's insistence vs. technician's shift advances plot. Voice modulates rhythm under stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with urgency, propulsion strong in revelation beat; high density integrates setting into action. Minor overwrite in repeated "exile" echoes purposeful but borders loop; no closure harm. Clean syntax, specific verbs like "hammering" embody stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of coded shanties as maps and nail-revealed indentations transforms tropes into fresh causal engine. Risky tonal blend of dread and redemption heightens stakes organically. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, no derivative hedging.</comment>
