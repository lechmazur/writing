<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between religious skepticism and compulsive pull to the beaded valve, embodied in scoffing yet tactile grasp; final resolve earned via discovery with tear as visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene (drowsy alertness vs. hyper-awareness).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory progression and Eleanor’s recalled words accumulate to CR closure where turning the wheel reweights ghost legend with emotional cost (tear traces cheek). Orientation anchored in opening lines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel's damp darkness and headlamp beam constrain navigation to valve, charging final image; recurring "hush" and bead glint mirror internal reappraisal through explorer's biased eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraise swallowed truth) signaled early, deepens via valve discovery narrowing skepticism to resolve; agency in turning wheel forecloses misunderstanding with legible tear cost, but tightening borders on single textural shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silenced truth vs. mercy emerges organically via beads reprised as rosary vow; final image ("truth shift") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (rust scent, skittering echoes via explorer's lens); rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences at valve grasp) heightens pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "breath hitched" advances realization); minor recurrence of "hush/silence/profound" taught as tone pattern without loops, but elevated diction edges register in peak epiphany.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost legend transformed via grandfather's rosary vow into quiet courage legacy; risk in solo realization closure feels inevitable and fresh, synthesizing skepticism with mercy.</comment>
