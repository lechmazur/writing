<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ancestral loss drives all choices, embodied in swift sketches amid accelerating winds; interiority concrete via cloud readings. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, e.g., no shown hesitation before frantic dubbing. Endurance of purpose earned with visible physical cost at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fractal sketches layer density to cadence shift at final dub, yielding RR closure ("storm’s threat dissolved") with legible cost ("chest heaving"). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph. No causal breaks; persistent cloud constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driftwood circle and swaying trees constrain choices as sonic canvas, charging final apple drop image. Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-biased (salt air, wet wood post-storm). Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal harmony without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard preservation) signaled early, escalates via density increase (frantic spirals, gust-torn blossoms dubbed into vibrato). Agency in layered dubs narrows options; visible cost in effort/prayer cry forces trade-off. Coheres under accumulative lens to charged final chord.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of obstacle-to-instrument emerges organically via storm collaboration; final image ("storm turned into lullaby") reweights chaos-to-pattern without moralizing. Grandmother's recalled words borderline echo but anchored to apple drop realization. Complexity in invitation over resistance lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (cloud/tide readings as biased noticing); rhythmic prose modulates tension (short strikes in frantic dubbing). Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" exact repeat x4 creates template artifact, dulling density in peak beats (−1.0); minor paraphrase loops in sketching/dubbing sequence. Figurative coherence strong but overwrites propulsion in climax ("erupted note... soaring chord"). Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophet-harmonizer premise via mallet-etched fractals transforms eco-fantasy tropes organically. Risky lyric build heightens stakes without gimmickry; irreplaceable cloud-to-bark transduction feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
