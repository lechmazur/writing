<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in loss drives tactile repair with embodied calm, earning realization; contradictory impulses in imagining hands' memory vs. nose's absence act in scene. Mrs. Gable's tremor forces empathetic micro-choices. Minor slip: epiphany phrasing borders unearned ("her own wholeness") without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to screw's "quiet click," culminating in CR via realization reweighting loss as redirection, cost legible in "trembling calm" settling despite absence. Orientation anchored early (shop, fog, Elara). Single tightening via occluded screw alignment suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shop's water clocks and fog constrain patience/touch in repair, charging final image of "liquid symphony" mirroring birth/mending. Sensory hierarchy (touch over vanished smell) reflects POV; brass wear patterns integrate via action. Climax screw threads "nearly invisible" narrow perception purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair for birth) signaled early, tightens via occluded screw resistance forcing tactile reliance; agency in "pouring intention" forecloses doubt with Mrs. Gable's tears as felt relational cost. Accumulative escalation via deepening empathy reweights Elara's loss. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles emerges from repair particulars, final CR image ("quiet click... new beginning") non-literally answers loss's repricing without moral. Subtext in thumb groove implying hands' history enriches without statement. Resists tidy binaries via persistent loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tactile perceptual signature ("hands that remembered"); voice texture modulates poetically yet legibly under pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("mended more than metal"). No head-hopping; diction fits humble healer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with drip chorus pacing repair; high density in "threads engaging precisely." Minor deduction for figurative density ("alchemy," "pouring silent prayers") pervading repair beat without full sparsity, though pattern-taught. No loops; propulsion clear to click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scentless aromatherapist alchemizes water clocks into birth empathy, transforming loss trope via screw's click as miracle. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates; clamp's wear patterns personalize ingenuity.</comment>
