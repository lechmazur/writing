<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the flaw moment—urge to abandon everything vs. ritual release—earning the thaw with embodied cost (tear, chest open); interiority particular via bookmark cue and narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from gather to flaw ping to dome image as Charged Poise closure, cost legible in "I abandon you...to make space"; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via scrap bin proximity and annealing oven, charging final dome image; drip-drip-drip mirrors internal thaw purposefully across senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe zones amid grief) tightens accumulatively at flaw fracture, forcing renunciation agency with felt cost (shoulders slump, old urge surges); forecloses distortion path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness holding light emerges organically via flaw abandon and dome refraction, reweighting bookmark quote without statement; resonant image answers thawing heart non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in spirited narration ("Behold...liquid light"); rhythmic texture modulates from dramatic to weighty lightness at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (drip repetition taught early); minor overwriting in metaphors like "liquid metronome" slightly muddles peak flaw beat but doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh post-glacial glassblower synthesis transforms sanctuary trope via control room micro-setting and bookmark poetry; risky lyrical narration heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
