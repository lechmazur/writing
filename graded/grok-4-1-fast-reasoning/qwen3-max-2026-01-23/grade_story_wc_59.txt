<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation roots deeply in rebellion against the mechanical world, embodied in stained hands and quaking reverie, with contradictory impulses (restoration hope vs. flawed genesis shadow) acting in the assembly and climax. Final acceptance earns through prior causality, foreclosing resurrection with gratitude's tears. Solo POV excels in interior specificity without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from preparation to spectral hatching and fade, yielding CR closure in "flawed genesis made manifest" with conceptual cost of irreplaceable loss reweighting premise. Orientation anchors early (prince in suspended palace). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (mechanical world) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains: suspended palace's crystalline corridors and stalactites enable isolation/assembly but mechanical world below dooms physical form, charging "the mechanical world could not sustain physical form." Sensory details (mist, gears, jasmine air) filter through Kaelen's priorities. Micro-setting (altar, lenses) guides pivotal hatching.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) tightens via spectral bird's fade, narrowing options in flawed genesis deepening driven by Kaelen's assembly agency. Cost unmistakable in "light dimmed" and "bitterly sweet" requiem, reweighting under accumulative lens. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of flawed genesis emerges organically from hatching specter and feather-seed, offering non-literal answer in "requiem: a beautiful farewell" reweighting resurrection premise. Minor slip: explicit "discovered requiem" borders echo but dramatized via motes and tears avoids moralizing. Resonance from particulars without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (hypothesizing lens on songs, joy); voice modulates rhythm from quaking anticipation to resonant peace. Lyrical diction purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding. Experimental compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images like "ephemeral forests on the walls" advance atmosphere without loops. Minor overwriting in prep descriptions (e.g., stacked metaphors pre-hatching) slightly dulls peak momentum, but no artifacts touch closure; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spectral Lark from flawed genesis transforms extinction trope via mechanical world's logic, inevitable in hindsight from hypotheses. Bold lyric risk (quaking reverie tone) heightens stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
