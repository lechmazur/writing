<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through patient echo-gathering to earned dissolution; synesthetic interiority concrete and particular, embodied in "wind tasted of lemon zest and regret."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: echo density builds cord that pulls Julian's essence, landing RR closure ("form growing lighter") with dissolution cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard and apple tree constrain time-weaving and charge final image (coin at "gnarled roots"); synesthetic sensory hierarchy (firefly glows as "warm kisses") POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lure possibility) signaled early, deepens via interwoven fragments narrowing oblivion; cost unmistakable in Elara's dissolution after cord stretches.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges organically; final coin ("lovers now clasped hands") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting timeline without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("scent of his cherrywood pipe, manifesting as bronze smoke tasting of caramel") distinct and stable; rhythmic control heightens lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor metaphor overlap ("silver thread... luminous cord... tapestry") slightly blurs peak echo-braiding without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost braiding timeline echoes transforms spectral reunion trope; cord-pulling climax feels inevitable from established pattern, bold lyric risk heightens stakes.</comment>
