<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through embodied tremors, void, and memory confrontation; contradictory impulses peak when "stopping fighting the memories" yields compassionate ache, earning the empathetic shift with visible emotional cost. Final choice aligns with rebuilt discernment, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clue density deepens stakes from archive to lake, tightening via rockfall crawl into resonant reconfiguration at ball placement, where integration cost is legible in tears and warmth surge. Orientation anchored early (procedure, archives); closure Charged Poise with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake and fungal glow constrain realization choice and charge final image, mirroring psyche's fragility; selective sensory details (dripping, moss "E.R.") integrate via goal-directed decoding, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through intuition-demanding forks narrowing options to memory surrender; agency in placing ball forecloses numbness with felt integration cost, protagonist-driven under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming betrayal-void into wisdom emerges organically from labyrinth particulars and light-weaving reconciliations; final ember image resonantly reweights past without moralizing, inviting complex reflection on clean slates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (jaded filtering of clues/memories); rhythmic modulation builds to terse "Tears washed the numbness," prose texture biased toward haunted precision under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated specifics (e.g., "ink smudge linking 'truth' and 'light'"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures, rhythm varies naturally peaking in surge of light threads.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural wipe, time-traveler artifact, and newspaper-decoded labyrinth transforms redemption trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at lake, heightening stakes through psyche-mirror.</comment>
