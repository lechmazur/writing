<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in vigilant noticing intensifies to compel the ritual placement; embodied tears and transformed quest earn change. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to hush descent ("profound hush descended") and CR closure ("aliveness was not in the structure, but in the love displaced"), reconfiguring quest with emotional cost in tears and "permanent shard of hush...within her heart."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful (damp cobblestones, lilacs); orris shard constrains placement choice, streetlights recur to charge final image ("guardians of the hush").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand house aliveness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shard placement inducing hush that forces realization; agency in kneeling act forecloses prior quest form with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of displaced love sanctifying spaces emerges from particulars like sea-glass and feather; final image ("displaced seashell holds an ocean of memory") offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of subtle shifts ("ivy’s patient climb"); lyrical rhythm modulates hush effectively, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied rhythm; figurative language consistent in lyric voice but stacks densely in hush beat ("thick, velvety presence...liquid gold"), bordering coherence risk without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy of displaced objects awakening houses, synthesized via orris ritual; risks bold lyricism heightening stakes organically.</comment>
