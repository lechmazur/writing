<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to verify the Charter roots consistently in traits like logical indexing, intensifying through discoveries to compel the stamping choice with felt cost in "chest tight with quiet victory." Interiority concrete and embodied via sensory absorption, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to Charged Poise closure in stamping both lie and truth, with legible conceptual cost as "permanent testament" reconfigures history's premise. Orientation anchored early in sunken city library during blackout; single scene causality intact without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent anemones and dappled light constrain watermark reveal ("precise angle to the dappled light") and charge final image ("dappled light...brightened as if in acknowledgment"). Sensory details vivid, selective, POV-filtered, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (verify honest origins) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sigil discovery narrowing options to alternative stamping, with agency in readjustment and visible cost in foreclosed alteration ("not altered history; restored"). Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth-over-erasure emerges organically from palimpsest reveal and dual stamping, resonant non-literal answer in "one page...set right" reweighting conquest narrative without moralizing. Particulars like spiral sigil drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in tranquilly perceptive noticing ("senses absorb the dappled resolve"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, distinct texture in syntax and watery diction. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overwriting ("dust motes dancing like forgotten syllables"; repeated "dappled resolve"/"reclaimed stillness") in discovery beats risks muddle, docking from 9-band; rhythm varies, no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken library palimpsest verification with leviathan bone stamp transforms tropes; stamping blank then carved face feels inevitable, risk-taking in lyric worldbuilding heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
