<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in grief, embodied through tears and skin absorptions that drive micro-choices like dowsing left around thorns; final acceptance of intertwined grief/love feels earned via mentor recall and ring's cooling. Minor flaw: skin perception borders idealized competence without enough struggle's blind spots compounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory notes densify to silence at stillpoint (line ~200), delivering Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost in "grief and love are intertwined notes"; orientation anchors early at threshold; one tightening via converging lullaby suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skin-filtered sensory hierarchy (dewdrop's high C ping, river's low G thrum) constrains path choices and charges final stillpoint image; ultrasonic hum evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach stillpoint amid grief) tightens via ring's blaze to silence, forcing endurance with embodied cost (breath caught, tears); agency in dowsing narrows dissonant paths under accumulative lens, though external opposition remains subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inner mapping emerges organically from musical trail resolving to peace chord, reweighting grief as enduring strength in final image without moralizing; mentor's lesson anchors subtext, inviting ambiguity on loss/transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with skin-biased perceptual signature sustains lyrical rhythm modulating from hum to silence; purposeful compression in note-mapping feels voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences at halt: "Elara halted, breath caught"); high density via multi-job lines, but "absorbed" repeats and word-count artifacts slightly dull propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skin-cartography in ultrasonic realm transforms sensory tropes into emotional dowse, with stillpoint's silence as inevitable risk-taking payoff heightening stakes organically.</comment>
