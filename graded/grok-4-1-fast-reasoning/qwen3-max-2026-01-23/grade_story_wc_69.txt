<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's expectantly resigned trait roots motivation and enables micro-choices like holding silence, earning the relational crucible in Liam's falter supported by Anya without smirk. Secondary characters apply pressure through hesitant entry evolving to honest connection. Minor slip in diagnostic interiority ("hatred was not shouted down") slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of subtracting noise taught early deepens density to Charged Poise closure in solstice dialogue ("Your orchard’s apples... Your father taught me"), reconfiguring fractured relationships with felt emotional cost legible in Elara's "quiet awe" and warm rosette.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Velvet library's dust motes, amber light, and frost-feathered windows filter through Elara's perceptual priorities, mirroring internal thawing; rosette as micro-setting anchors and charges final pocketed warmth, constraining the silence-born resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (braiding voices vs. hatred) signaled early tightens accumulatively via practices culminating in Liam-Anya micro-support, narrowing options with deepening relational pressure; cost felt in tear and foreclosed defensiveness, though agency subtle in facilitation endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning hatred emerges organically from subtracted silences and braided voices, resonating in final orchard dialogue without overt moralizing; deducted for explicit articulations ("Hatred was not shouted down"; "Harmony was not the absence of discord") that border thematic echo in key beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with Elara's perceptual signature (musical stillness, embodied breath); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Liam-Anya's soft revelation), distinct from narration; rhythmic modulation heightens quiet pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath (short hum sentences amid longer lyricism), high density in sensory integration; minor deduction for dense simile stacks ("low as settling snow," "steady as bedrock") bordering overwrite in opening without obscuring closure, purposeful "subtract" pattern avoids loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms choir reconciliation trope via "subtracting noise" mechanics and rosette's denoting arc from loss to continuity; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
