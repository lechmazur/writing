<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied micro-choices like oil-stained fingers seeking truth and tears tracing cheeks post-fix, revealing contradictory impulses of conquest vs. compassion. Motivation to harness the ephemeral drives all stakes with consistent traits. Final recalibration earned via prior causality, foreclosing forceful repair with felt luminous ache. 9+ test met: impulses act in scene, choice costs visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tremor density builds to leaf *tap* insight, tightening to empathetic release with on-page closure via clock's sigh and hand clicking to twelve. Cost legible in "luminous ache" and preserved miracle. Single scene, orientation anchored by ~50 words (Mount Aethel, Observatorium). 9+ test: closure reconfigures with constraint (mainspring tension) shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moon as recurring object constrains (anchor amid chaos) and charges final image with leaf. Micro-settings like obsidian floor and bonsai leaf guide choices tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: gear whine over spinning hand. 9+ test: moon/leaf constrain and charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture Veil sans steady Chronometer) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via leaf micro-turn narrowing to yielding method, forcing trade-off (empathy over force). Agency in screwdriver pressure "softer than breath" forecloses resistance path. Cost unmistakable in mechanism's whine silenced, data stream's confirmation. Climax hand-click seals under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of yielding to chaos emerges organically via leaf-moon-leaf arc, reweighting escape velocity in final image without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, though ending nears echo in Aris whisper. Protagonist arc inextricable from constancy vs. tremor. 9+ test nearly met but minor thesis articulation dings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: cosmic indifference filters crisis. Prose texture lyrical yet biased (lunar whispers, soul's threshold). Rhythm modulates stress (frantic whir to soft sigh). 9+ test: signature holds under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short tremor sentences to flowing insight), high density integrates action/image. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "sewing chaos into time" but purposeful for textural lens; no loops touch closure. Propulsion peaks at "soft metallic sigh." Some figurative density in high-pressure fix risks −0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clock as terrified mechanism fixed via leaf-empathy transforms repair trope. Leaf-moon reprise inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmick. 9+ test: non-obvious yield-as-strength, risk elevates (+0.3).</comment>
