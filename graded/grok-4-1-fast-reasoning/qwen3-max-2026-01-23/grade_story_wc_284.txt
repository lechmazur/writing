<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (trembling hands, heart stutter) and earned change via pillbox reveal, with contradictory caution-daring impulses acting in the code-tracing beat; minor slips in reflective label-speak like "prudently daring" but no unearned epiphanies touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in pillbox exchange; orientation anchored early (Zephyr Bluff, mist, snow); Anya's arrival and code-melt motivated by shared history, cost legible in vulnerability of the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist, zephyr, melting snow-code constrain solitary act and charge final thaw image; sensory hierarchy (silver hush, damp moss) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clear in gravel crunch reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding courage to repair trust) signaled early, tightens via Anya's arrival forcing deepening reveal; agency in pillbox handover forecloses isolation with felt relational cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repair emerges organically from snow-code melt and pillbox flower reprise reweighting breakage into light-admitting fracture; resonant non-literal close in "fractures let in light" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable Elias POV with perceptual signature (cipher as stitch); dialogue subtextual ("messages that couldn’t be held against you") advances goal; rhythmic modulation fits lyric Accumulative texture, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (zephyr whispers), but minor paraphrase loops on "thaw"/"mend" (final paragraphs) and repetitive "silver hush" slightly dull propulsion without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Snow-code cipher and pillbox flower transform spy redemption trope via textured imagery; fresh synthesis in vanishing messages as vulnerable truth feels inevitable in bluff's hush.</comment>
