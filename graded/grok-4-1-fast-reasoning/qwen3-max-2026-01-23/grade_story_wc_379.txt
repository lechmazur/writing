<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's patient discernment and vow to prove listening heals drive micro-choices like storing story fragments, with embodied calm under time pressure. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as competence dominates without visible internal struggle. Mr. Henderson's arc adds relational crucible effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: story fragments density-build to locket opening (DC) and community reconfiguration (RR) with felt emotional cost on page. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (courtyard dawn). Closure cost legible in "sixty-year wound" healed amid noon deadline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (jasmine hum, gilded cobblestones) filters through Elara's priorities, constraining gathering via courtyard pillar proximity. Recurring courtyard charges final shrine image, mirroring internal peace. No white-room; spatial choreography clear with neighbors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve mailbox via listening before noon) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density of stories narrowing to key twist. Agency in patient following forecloses force option with time cost. Protagonist alteration (vow validated) earns resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing emerges organically from story accumulation, resonant in final courtyard embrace without moralizing. Locket reprise reweights promise motif. Official's murmur adds minor echo but subtext lingers in ambiguity of "almost discarded."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sandstorm calm noticing pauses/sighs); rhythmic modulation builds to hushed click. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (e.g., Mrs. Gupta's murmur advances plot). No head-hopping; diction coherent to curator voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short hush vs. lyrical openings). Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "dust motes dancing") during climax but no muddle or loops touching closure. No scaffold; concrete images propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift curator heals community via story-listening transforms mailbox trope into accumulative grace. Risk in multi-neighbor cast coheres spatially. Non-obvious turn via locket key from fragments feels earned hindsight.</comment>
