<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in obsession with trees' witness is concrete and drives micro-choices like breath-holding and dream-mapping; embodied emotion peaks in tear tracing grime. Interiority particular but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax beat, tilting toward steady resolve over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from storm to pin-drop pivot, culminating in on-page Resonant Reconfiguration as sextant heals and reveals tree memories with conceptual cost of integrated sorrow. Orientation anchored early (Elara in tower corridor with sextant); single scene fits defaults, closure cost legible in "fractures knitting not by erasing the past but integrating it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (rain lashing, lightning illuminating dust, pin tick on stone) filters through Elara's inward focus, constraining her wait for moonlight and charging final image of oaks glowing with memories. Micro-settings like sextant and pin evolve causally, mirroring transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair sextant for tree wisdom) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dream-mapping reveal and pin-triggered moonlight, narrowing to Charged Poise with felt cost in role evolution and tear. Escalation coherent under lens but lacks agency-driven reversal beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow alchemized into wisdom emerges organically from dream-mapping countering "quantified sorrow," resonant in final image of trees as archivists without moralizing. Subtext in moonlight integration offers non-literal answer to trees' witness, reweighting premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV with perceptual signature (dream fragments on leaves/stones); rhythmic modulation builds to climax hush. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short pin-tick sentence amid lyric flow); metaphors purposeful in accumulative mode without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in "silent" motifs voice-motivated; propulsion clear to closure chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant lore, dream-maps, and tree archives transforms tropes into inevitable mundane miracle; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, with pin-drop pivot feeling earned from silence buildup.</comment>
