<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation for Kael's silent teaching clear and intensifies through mirror and shutters; Elara's change earned by embodied responses like flinching then sobbing. Internal conflict subtle in her "half-spoken secret" trembling into release. Minor flaw: Elara's interiority lighter, shown more than felt contradictorily.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mirror beam to shutter symphony tightening Elara's despair into release. On-page Charged Poise closure in "The half-spoken secret dissolved" with tears as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in dock/rain; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt dock after rain vividly specific, wet planks enable light paths constraining Kael's weave. Sensory hierarchy (petrichor, gleaming azure) mirrors internal shift, charging final "flawless reflection of stars." No white-room; purposeful, lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elara's despair vs. silent intervention) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mirror to shutters narrowing her isolation. Agency in Kael's precise angling/weaving forecloses despair path with legible emotional cost in sob/release. One decisive deepening suffices perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of darkness learning stars' value emerges organically via light patterns, reweighting Elara's burden in final shared resonance without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures invites ambiguity; resonant image answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature biased toward Kael's calm observation; rhythmic texture modulates from tension to poise. No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early. Minor register elevation fits guardian's ancient poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful in lyric weave (e.g., "luminous vine"). Minor overwrite in stacked figures during shutters ("intricate patterns...visual arrow") dulls peak propulsion slightly; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dental mirror (ex-dental tool for light) and shutter-weaving transforms silence trope into visual symphony. Risky lyric pattern heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from guardian's ancient motivation.</comment>
