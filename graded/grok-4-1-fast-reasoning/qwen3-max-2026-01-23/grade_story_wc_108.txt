<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's phobia creates contradictory impulses acting in scene (flee vs. anchor to Lily), earning final weaving of fear into salvation with felt emotional cost in tears. Lily applies relevant pressure as vulnerable mirror. Minor label-speak ("firmly adaptive nature") slightly abstracts embodiment at (143).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links (DNA betrayal → library → decode cast → journal → mod shell → decoy chase). Closure as Decisive Change (etch shell at 195-209) with legible cost (phobia risk, tears at 255). Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rust tears concretely constrain choice to pedestal (156), shelves/vent/staircase enable tactics, stars charge final image (273-314). Sensory hierarchy (cold metal, whisper vibration, headlights) reflects phobia urgency. No white-room; evolved with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Lily/outwit Silas) signaled early, tightens via headlights arrival forcing shell mod (195). Agency forecloses hiding path with phobia cost legible in climb (218-230). Coherent Causal pressure narrows options once.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Betrayal-to-vulnerability theme emerges organically from particulars (phobia bond, shell mod); final image under stars reconfigures as power (263). Subtext in silences/gestures; resists tidy moral despite closing line. No overt statements until earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV stable, perceptual signature phobia-biased (rust, whispers). Voice rhythmic/poetic modulates with stress; Lily's dialogue childlike/subtextual ("shell talks"). No head-hopping; diction consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dense propulsion, varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (scorching veins, rust tears). Minor overwriting in opening simile stack dulls slight momentum; no loops or scaffolds. Clean mechanics; ignores generator word-count artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Core premise (phobia exploited by dad, outwitted via child cast/shell) fresh synthesis; decoy etch (209) ingenious turn from particulars. Tropes (betrayal, protect kid) transformed via rust/shell logic. Risks poetic tone heightening stakes.</comment>
