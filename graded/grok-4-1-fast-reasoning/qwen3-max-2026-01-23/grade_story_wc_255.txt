<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivations and micro-choices under relationship pressure; Elara's plant arrangement and Kael's shame-to-wonder arc earn change with felt cost. Minor abstract interiority ("awakening bloomed") slightly distances peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant arrangement → dialogue → reed note → mutual reconfiguration, with phoenix loss as persistent conceptual cost charging final images of resilient whole.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard shards, shoots, and glass constrain choices (arrangement incites, workbench enables); sensory details (ozone, crunch) mirror internal scars, charging closure image of thriving moss and warped gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in imperfection) tightens via agency (Elara's words, Kael's breath); reed note forces stance shift with emotional cost of forsaking perfection legible in final gratitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (bubbled glass as phoenix breath); resonant final image reweights imperfection as grace, though late repetitions ("beauty, imperfect") edge toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual bias (Elara's texture over color); dialogue subtextual ("silence is a space") advances stakes; no head-hopping despite dual focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("frozen tears," "pricked like a thorn") clusters early without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind synesthesia, phoenix scars, and reed song transforms rebirth trope; risk-taking in sensory poetry heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
