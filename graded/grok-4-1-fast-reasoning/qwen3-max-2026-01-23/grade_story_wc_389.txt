<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns consistently from solitude to earned connection, with micro-choices like deliberate fragmentation showing internal conflict. Hemlock's variant pull adds depth without diluting. Multi-POV limits deeper embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments accumulate to miracle clarity, discovery, feedback, landing CR in final portico image with solitude's cost felt. Mosaic shards taught early via broadcasts; transitions legible. Orientation anchored immediately in observatory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains as oracle/lens, charges final hopeful shadow image. Storm, shadows, orchard tactile and POV-filtered (Elara's visionary bias). Sensory hierarchy sharpens prophetic urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadow-wisdom vs. Kael's control) signaled early, tightens via miracle signal to discovery eroding doctrine. Accumulative escalation reweights fluid allegiance with cost of rigid certainty's doubt. Agency in Elara's broadcasts drives payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative shadows vs. rigid light emerges organically from fragments to mosaic dawn; final image reconfigures isolation as tapestry without moral. Subtext in variant receptions invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prophetic voice distinct, rhythmic modulation fits Accumulative texture; multi-POV shards clean with section-like breaks. Perceptual bias (shadow-seeing) consistent. Minor convergence in prophetic broadcasts intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with storm cadence, high density in broadcasts; minor overwrite in "gritty whimsy lived" meta-phrase dulls slightly but no loops or artifacts touch closure. Propulsion strong to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio fragments, ancient shadows, variant allegiances transforms oracle trope via storm-glass mosaic. Risky multi-shard prophecy unfolds inevitably; no derivative hedging.</comment>
