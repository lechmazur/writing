<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in obsession drives ritual choices to earned peace; interiority embodied in fingertip on droplet and watering eyes during countdown. Memory of mentor anchors without dominating present. Final smile reveals change with felt cost of released obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: countdown builds density to CR closure at "One" where realization reweights premise (clocks measure change) with conceptual cost of illusion shattered. Droplet's rise/fall as persistent constraint shapes ritual. Orientation anchored early in station post-whistle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hydraulic clock's pipes/reservoirs and horizon razor edge constrain ritual choices; fjord quiet and bone-hum evolve to charge final aurora image. Sensory hierarchy (water lap to plink) reflects POV's time-focus. Micro-setting droplet mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand clocks) signaled early, escalates via countdown's deepening (world softens, memory surfaces) under textural lens, narrowing to realization. Agency in counting/releasing focus forecloses obsession path. Cost legible in "no longer needed" and warm key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as change/silence emerges organically from countdown particulars, reweighted in CR without statement. Final fjord/aurora image offers resonant answer to question. Subtext in horizon illusion lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature time-obsessed (hum felt in bones, sun halts). Rhythm modulates with countdown intensity; purposeful compression legible. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer senses/action in countdown without loops. Varied rhythm (short "Ten" whispers to plink) fits textural lens. Minor motif repetition (razor edges) purposeful, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydraulic ritual/countdown transforms time trope; backward counting as perception reversal feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
