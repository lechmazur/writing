<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in Elara's sacrifice drives micro-choices like channeling regret into amber light, earning shift from hollow duty to purposeful ache; embodied tears of energy in climax reveal contradictory grief/love without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as each naming builds density to RR closure (diamond crystal with starlight reconfigures sorrow into compass); cost legible in "Tears of pure energy traced his shadowy cheeks" at void-beast naming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism and scattered light constrain choices (dusk alchemy only) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (amber rays, crackling voices) mirrors ritual urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (name fears, transform grief) tightens via density of crystallizations under accumulative lens, peaking at void-beast with agency (gathered light, spoke name) and cost (channeled unvoiced goodbye).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of naming fears into legacy emerges from particulars like Kraken-to-crystal; final diamond "captured starlight" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting sacrifice without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (perceives echoes/phrases); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate to reverent at "He spoke the name with reverence," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel ritual (e.g., ink "rising like purposeful mist"); figurative consistent in light-alchemy without muddle or loops in peak crystallizations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper grief + stellar cartography transforms tropes; void-beast naming feels inevitable, risk in poetic alchemy heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
