<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Corbin's brittle body contradicts his yearning spirit, embodied in clutched arrowhead and stilled breath; final humming integrates them with earned stasis as seeker-to-sanctuary, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation anchors canyon/who/when; birds' schism tightens density to convergence RR closure ("birds froze mid-flight, then converged") with conceptual cost of inward navigation over movement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bone towers and dust constrain stillness/navigation, charging final image ("dust swirled to claim it"); sensory selectivity (echoes amplify breath, feathers shift currents) mirrors reverence without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate via appraisal) signaled early, deepens via bifurcated flock under textural lens; humming agency crystallizes endurance with brittle-body cost legible in "did not rise...did not need to."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reverence/integration emerges from bone-libraries, bifurcated Pulse, converging sphere; final "quiet heart" reconfigures fractured-to-unity without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with reverent perceptual signature (dust as "sacred page"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity (short cries to thrum/chime merge), diction biased to resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "sharp cry split" to swirling dust); purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle, propulsion peaks in humming convergence sans loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone-archive canyon, bird-weavers, still-integration transforms mystic tropes; risk of pure stillness heightens inward stakes, inevitable in "spirit flowing freely through time."</comment>
