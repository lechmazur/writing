<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost bride's motivation rooted in debt repayment drives all choices, with contradictory sorrow/joy embodied in her draining essence and final smile. Interiority concrete via spectral devotion and recalled betrayal. Minor diagnostic repetition of "mournful elation" slightly abstracts peak emotion without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from petal to Heartwood awakening, yielding RR closure in her dissolution with legible cost (essence spent). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coheres without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alchemical flora (silverbark, venom-thorn, Heartwood) constrain her timed actions and charge final cascade. Sensory integration (chill touch, harmonic tremors, honey-scent) reflects ghostly urgency. Heartwood trunk press pivotal, mirroring internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard awakening to heal Elias) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intensifying resonances narrowing her essence options. Climax Heartwood act shows agency with visible cost paid in her fading. No reversals needed; cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Love as poison/cure emerges organically from betrayal backstory to final "wounded and healed" particles. Final bead in roots reweights premise without statement. Ambiguity in her release invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on bride with clean perceptual signature (spectral ripples, grave chill). Poetic rhythm modulates intensity effectively. Minor end-shift to Elias perceptual bleed but closure lens holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; rhythm varies in awakening beats. Patterned repetition ("resonant," "mournful elation") motifs without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in motifs (e.g., devotion phrasing) dull slight propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral alchemy and lifetime debt via resonance mechanics transforms ghost trope. Risky lyric accumulative risks pay off in charged closure. No derivative echoes; bead/Heartwood inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
