<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "courage as the conscious choice to mend with empathy when every instinct screamed to flee," earning the soil-pressing closure with shadow transformation as visible cost. Interiority particular via shadow's color shifts and intuitive focus on emotional echoes. No label-speak; embodied in chilled fragment warming via channeled glimpses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: glimpses accumulate density to synthesis, tightening via "air thickened... weighted breath before reply," yielding RR closure in blooming orchard and serene ice with empathetic cost legible in kneeling act. Orientation anchored in opening orchard/ice setup. One meaningful deepening suffices; no shards or disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurrent shadows and mirrors constrain choices, charging final green/gold lacing; orchard roots and ice floes pressure stake, evolving from groan to cradle. Sensory weave (beeswax scent, cold fragment) filters via intuitive POV. Micro-setting (mirrors, soil-root juncture) guides reconstituting action without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard's salvation via reconstitution) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through glimpse density to "ice’s groan ceased," forcing empathetic synthesis with cost in overridden flight instinct. Agency in patient mirror-gathering narrows to soil act; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-mending emerges via woven glimpses (beauty/fear/hope), reweighting in golden wave and blooming without moralizing. Final image (shadow verdant, orchard defiant) resonates non-literally, charging prior terror/tenderness tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with intuitive perceptual signature (shadow-smoke edges, emotional echoes over visuals). Lyrical rhythm modulates from calm assessment to thickened air pulse; purposeful compression in glimpses legible under Accumulative lens. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density in glimpse-synthesis ("petals curling back... sapling erupting") propels without loops, though shadow-lacing motif borders paraphrase in floor/shadow stretches (-0.3). Varied rhythm passes ear test; metaphors coherent (indigo/silver to green/gold). Minor repetition ("glimpse" x3) taught early, pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-empathy fantasy via mirror-glimpses reconstituting crystal into ecological salvation; risk in lyric Accumulative drive pays off in defiant bloom image. No template tropes; anomaly premise transformed through precise, grounded acts.</comment>
