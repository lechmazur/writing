<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as pyramid scheme survivor drives concrete micro-choices like gripping the bolt and volunteering, with embodied emotion in memories poured into the Heartroot. Virtuous mischief reveals through past spores and final burial, showing internal consistency without stock phrasing. Minor slip in label-like "virtuously mischievous" but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from farm calm to Convergence aurora, culminating in on-page RR (bolt-to-diamond) with legible cost in "every memory" poured and resultant peace. Orientation anchored early (~50 words). No lens ambiguity; persistent bolt constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm and Heartroot constrain volunteering and alchemy, with sensory selectivity (cerulean glow, damp soil) mirroring internal pressure via POV bias. Bolt as recurring micro-setting charges closure transformation. Details evolve causally with Convergence, no white-room; final sapling burial reweights environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alchemize pressure) signaled early, tightens via volunteer agency into plea at Heartroot under Accumulative lens, narrowing to diamond with felt cost in purifying heat and lifted weight. One deepening suffices; moral calculus in pain-to-wonder visible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-to-diamonds emerges organically from bolt transformation and burial image, reweighting quantum promise without statement; final lightness offers resonant, non-literal answer to hardship-weaving. Subtext in glitchy messages and mischief enriches ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (shadows alive, bolt edges) biased to alchemy; voice texture modulates from calm to aurora intensity. Kaela dialogue natural, subtextual ("deep-sea weight"); no head-hopping, diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action; rhythm varies with scene (short chime sentence punches). Minor overwriting in opening figuratives (-0.3), but purposeful for tone and no closure muddle; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum alchemy, pyramid ruin, and shadowseam farm transforms survival tropes via bolt-diamond; burial risk heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
