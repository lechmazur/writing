<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when wilt assaults during key-turning, compelling endurance with embodied cost; final peace earned via prior philosophy. Interiority particular to rust-honoring worldview avoids stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to tether-forging RR with legible cost in "tears of strain streamed... hand never ceased." Orientation anchored early in chamber; closure reconfigures balance on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chamber's granite amplifies intention, constraining ritual choice; philosopher's stone chip as micro-setting charges climax glow. Sensory weave (hummed walls, liquid gold filament) filters through Kael's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightens via wilt seizing at key-turn ("crushing weight... knees buckled"), narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in persistent cranking/singing forecloses collapse with strain cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of restored cycle non-literally answers rust-balance theme, reweighting shadow/light without moral; emerges organically from song of acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice sustains perceptual signature (reverence in "hands... supernatural gentleness"); rhythmic control heightens strain without drift, fitting single stable POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in climax ("He poured his being... strand by strand"); minor thematic repetition ("honoring") purposeful, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rust-philosophy and sonic metaphysics transforms tropes; risk in metaphysical mending heightens stakes, inevitable in tether payoff.</comment>
