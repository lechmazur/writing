<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's embodied progression from "quiet, persistent ache" to "warming ember" reveals contradictory doubt on ascent; guides apply crucible pressure without dominating. Minor flaw: guide wisdom like "courage is a choice renewed" verges on unearned diagnostic insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as detours deepen to RR closure; "final, resonant click" on glowing star marks heart-realization with tears as legible cost. Orientation anchors instantly in ridgeway twilight; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridgeway's "narrow cliff path" and "thicket of old betrayal" constrain detours; mist parting reveals bay, charging final sky/heart turn. Sensory weave (sea song, moss bench) mirrors internal unfolding purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to find courage tightens accumulatively via ascent doubt and memory unlock; agency in meandering forecloses hesitation with felt tears cost. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inner courage emerges from star accumulation and detours; final "hands to rest over her own heart" reweights external search non-literally. No moralizing, though guide lines border explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with shoreline-infused perception stable in single POV; dialogue subtextual ("We do not rush") advances via implication. Rhythm modulates from gloom to indigo silver.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in mist-woven images propels without loops; varied syntax breathes with scene. Minor figurative density ("sea mist curled like whispered secrets") purposeful, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh mythic vigil transforms quest trope into heart-landscape meander; "broken leash a silver thread" risks lyric boldness heightening closure stakes organically.</comment>
