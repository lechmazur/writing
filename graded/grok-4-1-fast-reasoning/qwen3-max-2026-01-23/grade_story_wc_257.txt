<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief (trembling hands to steady wire) and earned change via micro-choices like folding crane; contradictory impulses in precision amid tears act in scene. Minor diagnostic slips ("silent scream," "therapy-speak") but don't touch closure renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers build to on-page CR (seeing grove reconfigures grief into purpose) with legible emotional cost in tears and softened withering; orientation anchored in first paragraph, closure image (locket on pedestal) undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory micro-setting (velvet curtains, pedestal, aperture) constrains climax choice (parting to focus) and charges final image (locket left as beacon); sensory bias via jeweler/astronomer lens vivid and selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bloom from grief) tightens via agency (part curtains, see grove) narrowing to renunciation of old craft; cost felt in tears/on-page renewal, coherent under Accumulative lens, foreclosing despair path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of artificial hope blooming emerges organically from particulars (crane vessel, grove mirror); final image (locket/sun, waiting crane) resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature jeweler-precise (creased prayers, etched nebula); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor overwriting (mixed metaphors like "quiet fire banked deep" in setup) and renewal paraphrases don't dull closure image but cap peak polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami coordinates to bioluminescent art transforms grief tropes; risk in lyric accumulative closure (observatory to workshop evolution) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
