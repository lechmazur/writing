<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation burns clear and compels ritual choices rooted in honoring absence; interiority particular through embodied actions like "deliberate, reverent pressure" powdering shard. Micro-choices reveal values with visible cost in working incompleteness. Minor slip: mild internal conflict shown more reflectively than simultaneously acting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure; chair's fading creaks causally link to ritual cadence, culminating in "scattered the powder... chair completed its final arc and stilled" with legible emotional cost of release. Single scene anchors orientation early; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rocking chair as micro-setting constrains timing and charges final image, guiding scatter choice; selective sensory details like "light fell in precise angles" and "porcelain dust" integrate purposefully via POV bias. Environment mirrors internal states through action without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to crystallize emotion tightens accumulatively as chair slows, narrowing to release before stillness; agency in powdering/drawing/scattering forecloses facade with felt vulnerability cost in "ghost of a quivering lip." One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability over illusion emerges organically from mask ritual and dust scatter; final image reweights "mirage of safety" non-literally via "courage to let light touch the cracks." Minor directness in realization line tempers peak resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature on absence/light/dust; rhythmic prose modulates reverently, prose as character in "each stroke a hypothesis built from absence." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in ritual beats; varied rhythm avoids loops, metaphors consistent like "melancholy snow." Minor paraphrase in repeated "quiet" stillness, but purposeful for tone without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ritual of ash-scattering in timed gallery transforms kintsugi trope freshly; chair-metronome synthesis feels inevitable, risk in accumulative poise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
