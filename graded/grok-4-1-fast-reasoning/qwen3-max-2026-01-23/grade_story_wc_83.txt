<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "bleak exhilaration" act simultaneously during the vision, earning the final purpose shift with visible cost in tears and trembling legs. Interiority particular via scarred fingers and marrow pressure; no unearned epiphanies until causality builds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perturbation density increases to vision's CR closure, reweighting loss with cost legible in "crushing weight of its content" and dissolved trance. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode and breakers constrain choice as resonator and timed window, charging final pocketed image; wounded Earth mirrors internal state through viewport. Sensory hierarchy selective to POV urgency, integrated into nudge action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens via bone pressure to pool revelation under accumulative lens, agency in mental nudge foreclosing denial with cost in "stolen possibility" swirl. Escalation driven by perception, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of pocketed geode offers resonant answer to potential-pooling question, reweighting premise through particulars without moralizing; bleak exhilaration emerges organically from vision's fusion of joy and loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "pressure change in the marrow," rhythmic diction modulates intensity; purposeful compression in vision beat taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from silence hum to power surge without figurative muddle, clarity intact in peak vision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perturbation theory on grief transforms sci-fi trope into fresh CR on potential's geography; geode's evolution from rubble to lens feels inevitable, bold lyric risk heightens stakes.</comment>
