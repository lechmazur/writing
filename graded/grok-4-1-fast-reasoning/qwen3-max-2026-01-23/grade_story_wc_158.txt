<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of despair vs. quiet resolve act throughout, earning the final surrender where "pain and beauty clasped hands"; shyly unstoppable trait constrains micro-choices like nightly lullabies with embodied cost of endured centuries. Interiority particular via postcard tracing and saltwater tears. No unearned epiphanies; change credible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of longing builds to pattern break at resonance—"a soft light bloomed"—reconfiguring stake into Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of honored centuries. Orientation anchored early (shell sanctuary). Single tightening via wind shift suffices; closure legible on-page with postcard dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell's nacre slopes and aperture constrain refuge/ritual and charge final constellation image; galaxy postcard as micro-setting handled tactilely, mirroring internal spiral. Sensory hierarchy (humming vibration into palms) reflects POV urgency. No white-room; details evolve causally to luminescence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform pain via poetry) signaled early, tightens via resonance deepening to armistice under accumulative lens; agency in persistent lullabies forecloses fighting darkness path with felt cost of "necessary compost." One decisive cadence shift narrows to acceptance. Cost unmistakable in tears as "reef-shadow joy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pain-as-soil emerges organically from particulars like lullabies seeding light; final duet image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting longing without moralizing. Subtext in imperfection's harmony avoids tidy binaries. Protagonist arc inextricable from acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "smooth as forgotten promises"); rhythmic control modulates from ache to luminous cadence, heightening pressure. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor overwrite in climax metaphors ("saltwater essence of reef-shadow joy") risks muddle without payoff; purposeful poetic repeats (ensconce, off-key) pattern-taught yet border loop in reflective beats. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no scaffold obscures closure. Zero artifacts in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise of shell-poet photosynthesizing insomnia via galactic resonance transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes, with postcard merger inevitable in hindsight. Fresh synthesis of longing-as-compost feels singular.</comment>
