<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in engineering poetry intensifies through micro-choices like using sextant as protractor; embodied stoic wonder peaks cleanly at "throat without a sound." Minor slip: label-speak like "functionally creative attribute" slightly abstracts traits without embodied tradeoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery to labor, closure as Charged Poise in "shimmering, liquid constellation" with labor cost legible. Anchored early; one tightening at trickle suffices. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains via dampness at Gate Seven and hatch, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (glint amid dust, gurgle) reflects engineer's bias. Micro-setting (fountain basin) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening labor ("stone by stone"); agency forecloses force for persuasion, cost in "time dissolved." Tightening at gurgle narrows to success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: final "hope equals creative intention multiplied by redirected flow" reweights maze without stating moral. Recurring flow motif charges constellation image organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (poetry in "stress calculations") stable in third-limited; rhythmic modulation under labor ("rhythm of her labor"). No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("pryed open...scraping against corroded bolts"); rhythm varies. Minor overwriting: figurative density ("liquid thread weaving") borders purple without muddle in peak gurgle beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil engineering, sextant geometry, and hydrological resurrection transforms abandonment trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off at star-chart image.</comment>
