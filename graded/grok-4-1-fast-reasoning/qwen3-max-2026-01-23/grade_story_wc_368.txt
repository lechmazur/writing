<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in heart rhythm and tears at revelation (line 206); motivation rooted in donor heart compels patient resolve with earned shift from collecting to reflecting stories. Minor slip: epiphany phrasing borders on diagnostic ("iridescent caution—a reflective presence") without full contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building light trail density to CR closure in wing flash and realization (lines 158-182), with legible emotional cost in tears and resolve (206). Orientation anchored early (first paragraph); single scene fits defaults, pattern taught implicitly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sun trail on stone floor and morpho wing constrain illumination choice and charge final image (168); selective sensory details (dust motes, mist tears) reflect watchful POV. Micro-setting (tea house bench/archway) guides patient action without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand story-magnetism via heart/wing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to revelation reversal narrowing "collect" to "create spaces" (228); agency in patient endurance forecloses prior path with felt tear-cost (206).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reflective empathy emerges organically via wing flash repricing Kaela's gift (168-182), resonant final image reweights premise without moralizing ("surface worthy of reflection," 298). Counter-reading lingers in donor reciprocity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in light/mist bias; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise ("light it revealed remained," 246). No head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in sun trail progression propels without loops; metaphors cohere (sky-shard blue, 168) without muddle in peak. Minor scaffold in repetitive "quietly explosive" phrasing taught as motif, but risks template feel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of donor heart, dye craft, and morpho optics transforms introspection trope into iridescent CR; risk in lyric patience pays off at revelation without gimmick.</comment>
