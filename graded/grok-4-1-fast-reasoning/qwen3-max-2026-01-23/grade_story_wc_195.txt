<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority and motivation rooted in allegiance vow; transformation from withdrawal to guardian earned via puppet release. Minor epiphanic phrasing like "shivering bliss course through him" borders on unembodied, but doesn't undermine closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery to dance to unsnapping builds to Resonant Reconfiguration with cost in surrendered puppet-self. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; closure sigh and light bloom reweight reality legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (liquid mercury, twisting paths) constrain dance choices and charge final orchard sigh. POV-filtered (knight's grace defying armor); environment evolves causally to dawn, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture possibility) signaled early, escalates via thinning veil and geometry shifts forcing pattern adherence. Agency in precise choreography narrows options; unsnapping forecloses fixed fate with felt bliss-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of duty-to-dream emerges organically from allegiance memory and puppet release; final twilight image reconfigures withdrawal into guardianship without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (mystical geometries, sigil-glow); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet urgency to bliss, fitting fantasy idiom without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dense, varied rhythm with purposeful metaphors; minor overwriting in opening orchard catalog slightly dulls early propulsion, but closure image clear. No loops or artifacts touch unsnapping beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical fusion of marionette-self and possibility nebula transforms knight trope; risk in Möbius paths and factually mystical program pays off inevitably at clasp release.</comment>
