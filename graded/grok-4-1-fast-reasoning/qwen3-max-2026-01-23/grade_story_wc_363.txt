<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in love compels sacrifice, with embodied release in "Tears traced clean paths through dust on her cheeks." Internal wistfulness shows through micro-choices like clearing frayed threads, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from unraveling to wholeness; closure as RR (hands translucent, woven in) lands with legible cost in final weave. Orientation anchored early in orchard; puzzle edges motivate tightening without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via fading orchard ("vibrant blossoms bled to gray") and supplies fibers (bamboo resilience); sapling charges final image as orchard echo. Sensory details selective through Elara's priorities, mirroring dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (send message) tightens accumulatively as raveling accelerates, forcing sacrifice; agency in weaving silence gathers chaos with cost in "loom’s solid wood grew faint." One deepening forecloses present reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice mending time emerges from particulars like puzzle borders defining center; final tapestry and sapling reweight unraveling hush non-literally. No moralizing, ambiguity in healed silence lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with weaving syntax ("Thread by thread, she gathered the raveling silence") stable in single POV; perceptual bias toward resilience textures perception consistently. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (weaving metaphors taught early), but minor overwriting density in peak weave slightly dulls propulsion; no loops, rhythm varies. Closure image clear despite poetic load.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom-weaving time message via puzzle edges and self-sacrifice transforms silence trope; final sapling inevitability risks bold lyric closure without gimmick.</comment>
