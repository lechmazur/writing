<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices in swaps reveal contradictory reverence amid despair seeping into bones; sacredly playful trait shown in joyful focus despite grim setting. Label-heavy traits like "cautious abandon" slightly undercut interior specificity at pivotal king swap, but earned change lands with tears and forgiveness warmth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with each swap tightening density and breaking sky pattern toward RR closure; orientation anchored early in spire ascent and wrong sky. Gardener king placement delivers on-page decisive reconfiguration with constellation alignment as conceptual cost, no slips touching ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (vertigo reflections, humming air, solidified moonlight) constrains choices via fissure slip and charges final healed sky image. Ice walls mirror internal fracture, evolving causally with warmth post-swaps; recurring spire pressure heightens tactics without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend sky fracture) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pawn despair seep narrowing to queen/king swaps with spire groan complications. Protagonist agency in precise swaps forces trade-offs, visible costs (cold bones, tears) alter chamber and sky; charged poise in final light reweights harmony stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of restorative wonder emerges organically from swaps shifting isolation to connection, culminating in non-literal CR: "greatest theft was never taking, but giving back" reweights premise via sundial glow without moralizing. Particulars like shadow-wood greed vs. cherry harmony avoid binaries, lingering ambiguity in unknown dawn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of reverent patterns (constellations as promise); rhythmic modulation builds from ascent strain to golden light warmth. Elevated diction fits fantasy lexicon, purposeful compression in swap beats maintains texture under stress without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., swaps integrate action, emotion, sky change); varied rhythm propels accumulatively without loops dulling closure. Minor template cadence in repeated "He swapped [piece]" across mid-beats (−0.4), but purposeful for pattern and absent from king climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess-secret mechanics transforming thief trope into wonder restoration; hand-carved swaps on floating board offer non-obvious celestial fix with inevitable hindsight payoff. Risky accumulative escalation via hollow cores heightens stakes organically, no derivative hedging.</comment>
