<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's guilt-driven motivation intensifies through concrete actions like uncorking the perfume and playing the Nocturne, earning her apology's raw delivery; spirit's responses reveal complementary grief without stereotypes. Contradictory impulses surface in her "imperfect miracle" stance versus the orchard's doom. Final choice forecloses total redemption with felt cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from dust motes and perfume to music's vibrations, yielding Charged Poise closure where spirit dissolves peacefully ("He smiled... before dissolving") with legible cost (orchard falls, past unforgiven fully). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archive shelves, piano, and orchard constrain choices (music stirs chorus, scent rides currents) and charge final image (axe bites as silence settles). Sensory hierarchy sharpens via Elara's priorities (jasmine ghost vs. dust). Environment evolves causally with events, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect via apology before logging) signaled early, tightens via spirit's shimmer and music's swell under Accumulative lens, forcing Elara's renunciation of full salvation. Cost unmistakable in "It could not regrow the orchard... but a profound reconnection." Agency drives escalation; moral calculus between honoring memory and loss peaks authentically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of flawed reconnection emerges organically from perfume-music alchemy and orchard's fall, reweighting "saving what is lost" in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (jasmine, Nocturne) invites ambiguity on redemption's limits. Protagonist arc inextricable from central question, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (regret-tinged noticing of "cracked leather spine," "aching hush"). Voice texture distinct in rhythmic prose and dialogue subtext (spirit's "You advise through metaphors" echoes Elara's idiom). Rhythm modulates with intensity; no head-hopping, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("cathedral of suspended breath," "vapor" for scent) integrated into action, no loops or muddle despite figurative density in climax. Propulsion varies rhythmically; minor register elevation fits ethereal tone without drift. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist premise freshly synthesizes supernatural ritual with journalistic guilt via scent-music currents, transforming ghost/redemption tropes organically. Risky metaphors heighten stakes (apology as "careless axe"); final reconfiguration feels inevitable, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
