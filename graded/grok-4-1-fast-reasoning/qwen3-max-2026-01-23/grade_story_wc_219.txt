<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's luminous skepticism and academic rebellion drive concrete choices like following footprints and extending amber, earning convergence with embodied tears; minor label-speak repetition ("academically rebellious") slightly abstracts interiority without touching closure shift to devotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from path to basin reveal; CR closure lands on-page as ideological war dissolves into shared awe ("their ideological war dissolving into shared awe"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of abandoning skepticism for alchemy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like petrichor, lilac, and resin exhalations filter through Aris's biochem bias, constraining path via footprints and jasmine fissure; basin resin and tower glow charge final image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of isolating homecoming chemistry tightens accumulatively via footprints to basin convergence, narrowing options from solo defiance to shared revelation; cost legible in tears and foreclosed rivalry, though external Institute pressure remains off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of home as molecular resonance emerges organically from amber-basin interaction and final glow mirroring skin; resonant non-literal answer in "home is not a place reached, but a resonance felt," with minor pseudo-profundity risk but no final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with biochem-perceptual signature ("molecular signature was her compass"); sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven ("You followed the footprints too"), distinguishing voices briefly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel via vivid images, but purposeful "bronze quiet" recurrence borders overwrite in chamber beat; no loops or artifacts dull closure image of glowing stones.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-contact biochem resonance via amber repository transforms alien tower trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens molecular-home stakes inevitably.</comment>
