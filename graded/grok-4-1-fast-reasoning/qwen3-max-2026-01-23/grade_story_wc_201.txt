<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied trauma responses like heart hammering and tears reveal contradictory impulses of fear and revelation; final strap repurposing earned via cumulative unlocks. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure: strap as compass reconfigures captivity to liberation with penance's felt cost ("self-imposed exile"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via memory cascade.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>UV glyphs and pine needles constrain micro-movements, mirroring internal vaults; Fibonacci oak charges final theorem image, filtering through enhanced bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy's math) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through unlocks like interrogator's flicker (Mercy_Coefficient_01); costs legible in adrenaline surges and tears foreclosing despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as recursive function emerges implicitly from particulars like nurse's thumb and daughter's laughter; final "translating pain into pattern" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in proprioceptive mapping ("precise pressure of pine needles") biases noticing; stable single POV with rhythmic modulation under stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("Each surge of adrenaline was a key turning in a lock"); minor template cadence in "memory" unlocks (−0.4), but closure image clear and artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of UV penance, proprioception, and mercy's topology transforms trauma trope; "Mercy = Σ (small kindnesses) / (opportunity for cruelty)" feels inevitable from priors.</comment>
