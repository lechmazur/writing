<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in embodied regret ("splinters biting his palm"), earning the vow through contradictory impulses of ritual solace vs. festering truth; minor diagnostic labels like "tempered regret" slightly abstract peak realization without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure in the vow ("He would speak the words at dawn"), with legible conceptual cost of honesty crystallized around the carving discovery; orientation anchors crisply early, one tightening via thumb snag suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings and shore constrain choice by enabling the pivotal snag and sieved hush, charging final image; cobalt terrace bookends as threshold, sensory details (moss-slicked steps, lap of waves) purposefully mirror internal filtering without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guilt escalates accumulatively through carving discovery narrowing excuses, forcing stance crystallization in vow; cost felt viscerally in "splinters biting," charging poise though not yet paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight emerges organically via shifting images (driftwood as honest witnesses vs. manufactured memories), resonant CR in internalized hush reweighting deception's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (sieved hush filtering) and rhythmic modulation under regret; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops on "weight," "guilt," and "sieved hush" (e.g., repeated rephrasings post-discovery) plus stacked metaphors dull density in reflective beats; figurative muddle ("dusk bled," "poisoning sleep") borders incoherence without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of false-memory genealogist and "sieved hush" ritual transforms guilt trope into inevitable CR; driftwood/watch hand inflections feel organic and irreplaceable.</comment>
