<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in observant trait compel logical investigation; embodied emotions peak legitimately in tear-chuckle at journal ("A tear fell, followed by a soft, wry chuckle"). Minor reflection on regrets anchors to present cues without flattening pressure; final drafting choice earned with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: phone tip → report/log/weather checks → pen/journal → suicide proof → drafting DC/CR. Orientation anchored early (observatory, post-call). Closure lands decisively in "Truth...had set them both free," reconfiguring regret with emotional cost; single tightening via accumulating contradictions suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory vividly constrains: "Dome shutter secured closed" negates accident; echoing chamber mirrors isolation-to-purpose shift. Recurring pen nib charges final cap image; sensory details (cold air, green lamp) selective via POV bias. No white-room; spatial coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, tightens causally through contradictions narrowing accident narrative; journal revelation forces stance crystallization. Protagonist agency drives via logical scalpel; cost legible in regret redirection. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-journal, but closure charges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orbits metaphor emerges organically, reweighted in closure ("crushing orbits...redirected into orbits of understanding"); no moralizing, ambiguity in contrition lingers meaningfully. Final drafting answers "seek the contradiction" non-literally via grace/accountability. Theme inextricable from proof arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: "devotedly observant gaze caught the hesitant phrasing." Elevated diction fits heiress-journalist; rhythmic control modulates from lonely echoes to "resonant hum." No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel; minor overwrites like "orbits of regret—...like silent comets" mix metaphors slightly (-0.3), but not in peak journal beat. No loops touching closure; propulsion strong in contradiction chain. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh proof-by-contradiction detective frame in observatory; pen-nib clue/solemn playfulness transform tropes organically. Risky solo intellectual climax feels inevitable; synthesis of logic-love-regret particularized without hedging.</comment>
