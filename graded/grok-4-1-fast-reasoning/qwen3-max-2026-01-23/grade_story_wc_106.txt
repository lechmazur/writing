<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via embodied awe (breath caught, tear), motivation intensifies to compel path choice; contradictory thief-to-author shift earned with prior code struggle. Final weaving of lavender reveals values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to moonbeam reveal as pattern break (noon warning shifts), on-page RR/CR closure via forest turn with foreclosed train path cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald station ivy/flowers constrain code choice, moonlight dew on rose charges reveal; sensory hierarchy (light/shadow) mirrors internal reconfiguration, evolving causally to welcoming shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant destiny stake signaled early, tightens via moonbeam deepening that narrows options (abandon to follow); agency in jar use/plucking forecloses old path with felt emotional cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stolen-to-created light emerges via particulars (jar pulse, thorn arrow), final forest image resonant non-literal answer reweighting thief narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (light/loss bias), lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels; minor overwriting in metaphors ("liquid radiance spilled forth") slightly muddles peak reveal without harming closure legibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief/floral codes/moonbeams transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from code reinterpretation.</comment>
