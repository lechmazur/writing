<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's grounded trait in glass/light shapes concrete actions like coaxing filaments, earning the final harmony; embodied emotions in breath sync reveal character under pressure. Minor label-speak ("firmly grounded") slightly abstracts interiority but doesn't touch climax choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from breath sync to fog luminescence, culminating in on-page RR (dream sanctuary) with conceptual cost in boundary dissolution. Closure image of parting fog and star perfectly reconfigures premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost-rimed soil, skeletal pear tree, and fog constrain sync and repair, charging final bud image; sensory hierarchy (crunch of boots, dripping frost) reflects Elara's priorities. No white-room; orchard evolves causally with light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream capture) signaled early, tightens via deepening sync that narrows to harmonic welcome over force; cost felt in total unity demand. Dream flicker tests commitment without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Boundaries theme emerges organically from repair/creation blur, answered non-literally by humming sextant and swelling bud reweighting grief/grace. No moralizing; complexity in harmony's quiet cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (reflections, glass language); rhythmic modulation peaks in sync breaths. Minor filter-verb use ("listened for") doesn't dull climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in breath cadences; varied syntax propels to closure. Minor boundary/erase repetition is pattern-taught, not loop; no artifacts touch final bud image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror craft and breath-orchard harmony transforms dream-capture trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in bud/star closure without gimmick.</comment>
