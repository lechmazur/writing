<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses in battling grief while maintaining vigil; motivation rooted in grandfather's legacy compels endurance with felt cost. Micro-choices like spilling sand reveal values hierarchy. Final reverent presence earned by prior causality, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from night vigil to dawning hush, culminating in Charged Poise closure via shutter click and descent, reconfiguring crater's fate with conceptual cost legible in "the crater...would not outlast the relentless progress." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful (boots crunching, wind scouring, hush silencing coyotes), filtered through inspector's priorities; crater rim constrains endurance and charges final image. Micro-setting of chemical capsule and sand grain guides photochemical choice and memory. No white-room; evolves causally to daylight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph final dawn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via outlasting elements/emotions to hush-deepening; agency in endurance forecloses inaction path with cost of grief. Shutter trigger tightens under lens, but mining drone remains off-page, slightly softening on-page price legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance/memory vs. inexorable change emerges organically from sand grain motif shifting to outlast crater; final image ("carrying the last light of the old world") offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in hush's peace-on-knife-edge embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (geological attunement to light/sand/time); rhythmic modulation builds to hush's compression. Lyrical diction voice-motivated for melancholy, no leakage; elision of mining taught early, paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short hush sentences vs. flowing descriptions); purposeful metaphors (hourglass heartbeat, cosmic fire) integrate without muddle. Minor "outlasted" recurrence taught as motif, no loops; propulsion clear to click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photochemical timer echoing grandfather's analog hourglass transforms preservation trope; sand grain's conceptual endurance vs. crater's doom feels inevitable. Risky lyric vigil heightens stakes organically.</comment>
