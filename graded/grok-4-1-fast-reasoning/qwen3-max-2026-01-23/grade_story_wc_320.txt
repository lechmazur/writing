<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied shedding of assumptions ("felt the shard of hush warm beneath her fingertips"), with motivation evolving credibly from quest to listener; minor slip in abstract labels like "fantasy practicality" slightly detaches peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hiss to "resonant quiet" blooming in bones; CR closure via shard fusion and tears lands on-page with recognition cost ("every conclusion holds a genesis").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting anchors early ("wind-scoured platform of Spire Seven") and charges closure as "cathedral of resonance"; gorge, cables, moon constrain perception and participate actively without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find beginning in ending) deepens accumulatively through discards narrowing to bone-frequency; cost felt in tears and fused anchor, but internal pressure lacks one sharper trade-off mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-genesis emerges organically from shard, discards, quiet bloom; final image ("space between heartbeats") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual bias (signal interpreter's ear for "hiss softened, deepened"); rhythmic control modulates from electric crackle to serene hum, minor elevated diction in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("scent of ozone and aged wood"); minor paraphrase loops in discards ("released the belief," "let go," "discarded") drag rhythm slightly pre-climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Hollywood shard as "hush" transforms cosmic signal trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR without gimmick.</comment>
