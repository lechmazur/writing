<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to uplift silent contributors roots consistently in his broker traits and past observation, compelling the note's creation with felt humility cost; Liam applies relational pressure without overshadowing. Interiority concrete via "whimsically attentive gaze—honed spotting forged bills." Minor label-speak ("cautious exuberance") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: envelope/locket discovery builds density to CR closure in Elias's "logistics of the soul" realization and note-sealing, reweighting his transactional world with undeniable humility cost on the final walk. Orientation anchored early (Elias post-symphony in garden). Single scene causality tight, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (salt-kissed breeze, ivy glint, gravel path, lantern light) filter through Elias's broker precision, constraining choices (bench/ivy spot locket) and charging final dawn horizon image. Atmosphere tensions sentiment with sea-mist dampness, mirroring theme without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor Elara) signaled via locket, tightens accumulatively through Liam's arrival/tears to joint note plan, foreclosing inaction with emotional cost (tears, Elias's overlooked decades). Agency in drafting note crystallizes stance; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges organically from locket → plan → ripple image, reweighting premise via Elias's murmur without moralizing; final "first ripple... silent hands" offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in invisibility echoes charges closure without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature (broker spotting details); dialogue natural/subtextual (Liam's sentiment vs. sense), distinct idioms under starlight. Rhythmic modulation builds to charged dawn close; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels beats; metaphors purposeful (cargo multiplies). Minor overwriting in peak (e.g., "cautious exuberance bloom—a quiet joy tempered by humility, yet vast as the ocean") dulls slightly but misses closure. No loops/artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: broker precision spots locket sparking compassion cycle in seaside garden, transforming tropes (lost item) via mistaken address/meeting spot into inevitable heart-logistics shift. Risky lyric tone heightens without gimmick.</comment>
