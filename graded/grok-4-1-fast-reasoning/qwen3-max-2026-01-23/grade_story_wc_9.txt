<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (ink drinking starlight, thumb over crack); contradictory impulses (perplexity vs. control need) act in ritual; final release earned via embodied cost ("melting the icy knot"). Minor diagnostic phrasing ("penitential ascent") edges from peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions/ritual builds to CR closure ("lost time... in these fractures") with felt emotional cost on-page (anxiety melts); single scene oriented early (glade/clouds by para 1).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Midnight glade constrains (thin air chokes breath/choice) and charges final image (softens to embrace); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (starlight on ink, root altar); micro-setting (saucer/locket) mirrors internal shift without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover lost time) signaled early, deepens texturally via ritual/visions to foreclose control path; agency in micro-choices (unfasten, press thumb) with cost legible ("icy knot" melts); minor abstractness softens peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (time in fractures) emerges from particulars (crack, tracings, tear); final image ("seam of light") reweights premise non-literally; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in devotion's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable, perceptual signature cartomancer-specific (onyx ink, oracle fracture); rhythmic control modulates (builds to release); purposeful compression taught early, paid in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful lyric metaphors fit pattern but verge overwrite in ritual peak ("swirling vapor," "salive benediction"); minor paraphrase loops ("willingly perplexed" x2) dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartomancer's cloud ritual transforms birth-guilt trope via porcelain oracle and hand-tracings; risk in lyric ascent pays in inevitable CR; no derivatives.</comment>
