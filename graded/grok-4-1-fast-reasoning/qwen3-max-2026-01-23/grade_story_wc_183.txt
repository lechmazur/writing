<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in clutching fraying memories versus journal-prompted release act simultaneously; final renunciation earned by persistent pressure with embodied cost in tear tracing grime. Blissfully aberrant trait shown concretely via whispering to mannequin and flowers on Ferris wheel. Interiority particular and degrading under fog-seep stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory threads build density, journal revelation breaks alteration pattern for RR closure via card release with legible emotional cost in spiraling descent and blooming garden image. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. One tightening via oilskin journal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ship's decay (splintered railing, frozen carousel) constrains discovery and mirrors internal fracture; fog seeps into mind, charging final unburdened smile amid parted fog. Recurrent card pulses warm, reprised in sunset beam drop. Sensory hierarchy biased to Lyra's aberrant joy in rust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture Kael via garden) signaled early; accumulative escalation via relentless memory alterations deepens to journal-tightened renunciation, foreclosing retrieval path with on-page cost of card surrender. Agency in persistence then release; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of internal garden via release emerges organically from journal's "unkindle solace" and card drop reweighting loss as reverence, offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars like frayed threads and blooming acceptance linger with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tender aberration (e.g., wildflowers on seats); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from fog-mournful to light peace, consistent under stress. Purposeful compression of memory shards legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative density (threads fraying, fog shroud) purposeful and coherent, integrated into action without muddle in release beat. Minor overwriting in memory lists but pays off at journal pivot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chimera loss, carnival decay, and memory-altering fog transforms grief tropes via "unkindled solace" realization; risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in card-release image.</comment>
