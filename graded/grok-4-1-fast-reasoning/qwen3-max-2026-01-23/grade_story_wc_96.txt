<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory fear of molt abandonment versus alchemical drive acts in scene via throat-tightening and seed-planting choice, earning acceptance with embodied cost; Kael applies relational pressure without stereotypes. Minor label-speak in motivation statement ("alchemy: to forge") prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from psychic tremor to seed-planting CR, reweighting transformation as renewal; cost legible in "Silas’s sharp edges softened, dissolving like frost." Orientation anchored early; single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted library beams and moonlight mosaic constrain as crucible, mirroring internal fracture and charging final "silver light flooded... glowing art" image. Sensory selection (rain-washed metal, gravel crunch) reflects urgency; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (molt eroding resistance voice) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Kael's reassurance and shared planting narrowing fear into Charged Poise; agency in kneeling/digging forecloses doubt with emotional cost. Minor abstract stakes legibility in early poems.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness birthing grace emerges via particulars like violet, seeds, beams; final seed image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting anarchy as fertile without moralizing. Subtext in "luminous fracture" motif shifts meaning organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poetic voice with perceptual bias (urban anarchy as cherished) stable in third-limited; dialogue natural/subtextual ("Luminous fracture"), distinct idioms. Rhythmic control modulates from tension to release without filter stacks or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; "moonlight fractured through a rust-eaten beam" propels via motif without muddle. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "ribs... clawing") but pattern-taught and legible; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Molting poet synthesizing vagrancy, architecture, resistance feels fresh and inevitable; "pressed violet" and sunflower seeds transform tropes via lived specificity. Bold persona shifts heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
