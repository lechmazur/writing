<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to execute a flawless goodbye compels concrete micro-choices like lifting the shard and weaving it into song, earning the reunion; relationships crucible forces Lena-Arthur connection with embodied grief relaxing into remembrance. Minor stock phrasing like "decisively kind eyes" slightly genericizes but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (song lyrics, shard, lavender) tightens to RR/Charged Poise closure in "father and daughter sat united... emblem of connection death could not sever," with legible emotional cost of loss reconfigured into peace; orientation anchored early in hospice room details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vinyl shard as recurring micro-setting constrains Elara's choice and charges final image of fingers closing around it; sensory selectivity (lavender bridging memory) mirrors internal states, vivid mountain ridge/clouds integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of flawless goodbye signaled early via blood work verdict, escalates accumulatively through song's deepening integration of shard/scent narrowing grief to connective stasis; cost felt in "not denial" and shared shard grasp foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of divine in mundane emerges organically via song hymning coffee/blanket details shifting to "even splintered things hold music," resonant final image reweights loss into "gentle note sustained" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable on Elara's perceptual signature of "hymning the mundane," rhythmic modulation builds to closure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Lena's "We'll keep listening") advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism (e.g., "voice a warm thread stitching ordinary moments into grace") propels accumulatively; minor repetition of "pulsing stillness" taught early, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice therapist using broken record shard/scent for reunification transforms sentimental goodbye trope via grounded sensory memory; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure charge.</comment>
