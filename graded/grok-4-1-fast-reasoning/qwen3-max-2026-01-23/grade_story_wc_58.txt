<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in sacred mapping of healing, embodied in thread ritual and tears during Kael's confirmation; internal conflict in seeking intimacy yields earned reconfiguration without unearned epiphanies. Kael applies precise pressure via persimmon gift, revealing shared wisdom. Minor flaw: brief diagnostic phrasing like "geography of healing" edges toward abstraction, but actions anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density building to CR closure in journal entry and garden hum, with felt emotional cost in tears and patient entrustment. Orientation anchors immediately (Elara turning to garden post-ship). Single scene tightens meaningfully at trance vision; Kael rustle adds micro-turn without breakage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden micro-setting constrains ritual (moss bench under willow) and charges final image (moonlight silvering frost, humming splendor). Sensory hierarchy (frost crunch, jasmine ghost) reflects Elara's priorities; autumn decay mirrors internal transformation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart healing's geography) signaled early, tightens texturally via trance deepening queen's "absence" into presence; agency in projecting presence forecloses doubt with tear-cost. Kael encounter complicates without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing as cultivated ground emerges via garden atlas (sundial acceptance, oak love), reweighting premise in final journal without moralizing. Resonant CR in thread relic honors absence as "holy spaces," lingering ambiguity of solace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature (salt-thick twilight, skeletal branches); Kael's sparse dialogue distinct ("Her absence...deepest presence") carries subtext. Rhythm modulates from solitude to charged poise without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload ("shattered stained glass," "bruised sky") risks coherence in opening beat (-0.4); no loops, strong verbs throughout. Propulsion peaks crisply in trance without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituary-writer projecting via thread transforms absence trope into "geography of healing" map; garden as atlas feels inevitable, risking lyric boldness without gimmick.</comment>
