<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices in untangling personal knot reveal contradictory impulses; final self-compassion earned via prior causality. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("self-compassion") borders therapy abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of threads escalates to RR closure via weaving spiral, reconfiguring reality with cost of embracing darkness legible in "He saw the light’s meaning was born from the darkness it pierced."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Threads as micro-setting constrain choices (pull to descend, untangle) and charge final image (erupting light, whole box). Sensory selection (brine, hum) POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore weave/self) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via personal knot; agency in redesign forecloses avoidance path with cost of "necessary darkness" felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shadow/light balance emerges organically from weaving particulars; final spiral image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting art's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (luminescent ache motif); rhythmic modulation supports pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (threads/weave) taught early; minor overwriting in peak weaving beat (stacked metaphors like "golden laughter knotted with ash-gray grief") dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot threads as reality-weave transforms artist despair trope; risk-taking in metaphorical fractal reality heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
