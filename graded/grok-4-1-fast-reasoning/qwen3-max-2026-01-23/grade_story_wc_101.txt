<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choice to softly chime the bell reveals values hierarchy (quiet covenant over loud joy) with relational cost to secrecy, earned by prior pairings; Lin and Lena's reactions show distinct embodiment without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from runs to "new understanding" tightening, climaxing in Charged Poise RR via chime ("deepen the silence") with legible conceptual cost of foreclosed celebration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arbor and bell constrain loud ring, charging final image; "sun-warmed tiles against encroaching chill" mirrors persistent unity, sensory hierarchy POV-filtered without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena steadying Lin on "rain-slicked slope" cadence shift deepens stake under accumulative lens, narrowing to soft declaration; agency in untie forecloses path with silence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bell's "crystalline note" reweights scarcity into "resonant fullness," emergent answer to isolation without moralizing; subtext in pairings weaves theme organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("amplified quiet") biases to resonances, rhythmic control heightens chime; stable single-POV, sparse dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels but inline "cumulative" artifacts create patterned scaffold/redundancy loops across lines, dulling immersion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Midnight runs as "classrooms of trust" transform sanctions trope into ritual weaving; soft chime rebellion feels inevitable synthesis.</comment>
