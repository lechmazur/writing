<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in silence's rift intensifies via embodied pressure (heart hammering at final glyph); contradictory impulses in "bold intuitive leaps anchored by meticulous cross-referencing" act in scene. Final admission to Kael earned by Codex resolution with relational cost. Minor label-speak ("carefully reckless") slightly abstracts traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of illuminated links builds to RR-Charged Poise closure in "paths...converged on a shared horizon," with legible relational cost in tears and renewed grip. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara, archive, Codex). One tightening at final triad knot suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass ink well as micro-setting constrains choices (glows only for sincere promises) and charges final image (cradled, hand covered under sunbeam). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (dust motes as "notes finding their place"). Archive subtly pressures via shadowed corridors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unsnarl Codex to restore trust) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via web formation to final triad under lens; agency in tracing forecloses doubt path. Cost felt in time pressure and emotional tears. Minor abstractness in "irreversible division" slightly mutes visceral hit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected promises emerges organically from Codex syntax to relational mirror ("a mirror for us"); final luminous sentence offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting silence into unity. No moralizing; ambiguity in "fractured trust" lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (linguistic reverence in glyph descriptions); voice lyrical yet consistent, modulating rhythm under stress (short sentences at flare). Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("You unsnarled the symphony"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short peak sentences at glow/flare). Minor overwriting in figurative density during unraveling ("luminous web," "symphony resolved") borders coherence strain but serves accumulative texture without obscuring closure. Repeated "cautious exuberance" minor loop (-0.2).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic puzzle via reactive ink and promise-resonance transforms trope into relational crucible. Risky poetic conceit ("symphonies of truth") heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; particular details (moonstone ink) feel inevitable.</comment>
