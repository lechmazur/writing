<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like tracing the scar memory while carving, rooting her practical channeling of grief in specific impulses that compel the ritual choice. Final endurance integrates loss with felt cost in cradling the carving. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like haunting practicality drive the process without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of carving cuts and memories builds to Charged Poise closure in the tea-sipping image, reconfiguring "here and gone" with integration cost legible in "filling the loft with rust-hued peace." Orientation anchors immediately in loft and ritual. Single scene coherence perfect; no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank constrain the timed ritual, charging the final window image where rain softens into peace. Sensory details (walnut ink, pipe tobacco ghosts) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring transience without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (kettle, gouge) evolves tactilely with cuts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing grief's wildness) signaled early tightens accumulatively via layered carving lessons, culminating in cadence shift at kettle whistle that forces stance crystallization. Agency in precise cuts endures opposition with visible cost (interrupted focus yielding integration). No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence as vivid presence emerges organically from carving "here and gone" into wood, reweighted non-literally in final rust-hued palette image without moralizing. Subtext in lion boundaries honors complexity; counter-reading (containment as suppression) lingers via grief's power. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature: practical lyricism biases toward tactile wood curls and rain clocks. Rhythmic control modulates from carving intensity to settling breath; diction reflects widow's resilient craft. No elision issues; voice coherent under ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: each sentence layers sensory action or memory without loops, varying rhythm for ear (short whistle shatter vs. flowing rain taps). No artifacts; metaphors coherent (raindrop as "here and gone"). Minor density dip in reflective blocks offset by integration into cuts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-tamer grief ritual into carving harvest transforms widow trope via Vermont ash and timed crystallization. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes of transience without gimmick; final seed-planting image inevitable from particulars. No template echoes.</comment>
