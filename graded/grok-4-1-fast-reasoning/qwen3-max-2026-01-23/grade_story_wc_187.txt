<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of sorrow and hope act in embodied details like throat-tightening ache and shadow-triggered recall; final resolve earned via writing act that forecloses isolation with tearful belonging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density (shadows, hush) builds to RR closure in fissure blooming after "continuance" glyph, reconfiguring memory with emotional cost legible in bone-resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Monuments' shadows constrain conjecture pivotal to inciting bold fog-canvas insight; solid fog evolves from erasure-threat to glowing sanctuary, charging final pearl-glow image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory-connection tightens accumulatively via conjecture reversal narrowing doubt to action; writing agency forecloses severance with vulnerability cost felt in expectant hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final whisper blending old chorus with her words non-literally answers memory-evolution question, reweighting prior forecourt recall without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in archival lyricism ("ozone scent, granite’s chill"); rhythmic control modulates hush-deepening without elision or slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory propulsion; minor opening figurative layering ("black river toward eastern cairn") pads slightly but pattern-serves accumulative hush without loop or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Solid fog as "new canvas" and summer-quill inscription transform archival isolation into resonant evolution, inevitable synthesis risking lyric stasis payoff.</comment>
