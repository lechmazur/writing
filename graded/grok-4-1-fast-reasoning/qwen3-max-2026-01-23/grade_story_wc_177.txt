<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (past/future clarity vs. present haze) act in scene via thumb-press despite foresight; final transcendence earned by causal buildup with cost of literal directive's loss. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("not a curse—they were the specific lenses") borders therapy-speak but embodied in raindrop clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from humidity threat to dream revelation to present integration; RR closure in glowing path/image with felt cost (blank directive, storm baptism). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening at seal-break pays off precisely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bunker vines/humidity constrain seal urgency; body (thumb-press, palms on table) and recurring raindrops/mud charge final image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (pine sap memory to rain baptism) reflects POV under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode before decay/storm) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven seal-break narrowing to dream-transcendence; cost unmistakable in blank parchment and mud-sunk boots under glowing path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonant paths emerges implicitly via dream-logic and final co-creator image reweighting premise without moral; protagonist arc inextricable from weaving tenses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (haze to "breathtaking clarity" in raindrops); rhythmic control modulates from charged haze to fluid certainty, eliding present taught early and paid in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "crystalline sigh" advances revelation); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, though minor figurative density in dreams borders overwrite without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal curse as path-lens transforms trope organically; risk in dream-dissolve/lyric payoff feels inevitable, heightening closure stakes via irreplaceable grit-ethereal fusion.</comment>
