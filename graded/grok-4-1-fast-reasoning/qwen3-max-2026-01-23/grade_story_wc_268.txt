<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in duty to truth over throne, embodied in meticulous inscriptions; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in on-page micro-choices under pressure, leaning declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of inscriptions building to resonant reconfiguration (library/Kael dissolution) as charged poise; conceptual cost legible in "serene fulfillment" amid erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian halls, Font of Echoes, and crystalline dome constrain subversion tactics and charge final fading image; sensory details purposefully filtered through reverent POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unmasking tightens accumulatively via embedded clues to Elara's reveal; protagonist agency in patient crafting yields dissolution cost charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of integrity over power emerges implicitly from particulars like spider-silk mending and final "peace deeper than any crown"; resonant non-literal answer in cosmic salute.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical cosmic voice stable with perceptual signature of quiet reverence; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative texture, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload ("time pooled like still water") in opening risks overwriting; rhythm varies effectively toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Diminutive titan in time-exiled library transforms exile trope into fresh patient subversion; vignette structure risks bold, heightens cosmic intimacy.</comment>
