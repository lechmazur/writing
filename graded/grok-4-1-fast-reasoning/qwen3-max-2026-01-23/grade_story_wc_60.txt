<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's luminous skepticism drives micro-choices like pocketing the stone despite doubt whispering "fool’s errand," earning her transformation to keeper with embodied tears. Contradictory impulses act in scene at the coins. Minor label-like phrasing ("luminous skeptic") shown through actions keeps it under 9+ cap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clue density builds from stone to key, culminating in on-page Decisive Change as box "unstuck with a sigh," reconfiguring city with felt emotional cost in her tears. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fountains constrain choices (e.g., moss on Weeping Maiden reveals coins, shadow niche yields rosemary), charging final image as water surges from basins. Sensory details (boots whispering, box humming) filtered through her priorities. Recurrent "forgotten fountains" evolves causally to renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate before dawn) signaled early, escalates via accumulative clue-tightening narrowing doubt-options, with agency in sidereal waits (e.g., moonlight reveal). Climax cost legible in tempered skepticism and tears, but minor abstractness in "higher-stakes choices" caps below 9. Goose cry as cosmic lock aligns under lens without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance vs. oblivion emerges organically from clue-gathering and fountain renewal, with final image of "echoes returned home" offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting skepticism. No moralizing; subtext in "quiet rebellion against oblivion." Protagonist arc inextricable from theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (city scars as "coded language"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure (short sentences at unstick). Lyrical compression taught early fits accumulative lens. Minor elevated diction in peak ("liquid light erupted") borders register drift but coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in clue beats, but patterned repetition ("defiant hush" x3, "quiet rebellion" x2) risks loop in final third, dulling closure image slightly (−0.4 non-closure cap). Metaphors coherent (geese mirroring Lyra), no muddle. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh magic-realist synthesis of constellation clues in decayed fountains transforms loss tropes, with geese-box alignment inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric patience payoff heightens stakes. No derivative echoes; bold city-heart unstick feels original.</comment>
