<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak vividly in the rift moment ("every fiber screamed to leap forward" vs. "profound stillness"), earning the refusal through prior interiorizing practices; embodied homesickness (sob "sharp as tearing vellum") reveals character under pressure. Final renunciation forecloses return with transformed ache as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to rift ignition, delivering on-page Earned Stasis closure when guardian loosens pendant grip, reconfiguring exile with legible emotional cost in "ache... woven with threads of acceptance." Single scene coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost-fern and ice-willows constrain choice by interiorizing into soul architecture, charging final image of settling against oak amid mist; sensory details (scents of paper/ink/beeswax from rift) filter through guardian's perceptual bias, evolving with rift recoil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesickness vs. befriending uncertainty) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at rift beam striking pendant—forcing refusal that forecloses return path with visceral cost ("ache... remained but had transformed"). Agency in loosening grip crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of tending boundaries emerges organically from light/shadow observations and refusal, with final image ("gaze resting peacefully on ever-shifting boundaries") offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior homesickness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (geometry of frost-fern as "internal truth"); lyrical diction ("breath feeling like the gentle closing of a cherished book") modulates rhythmically under rift pressure, maintaining foggy lucidity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration (e.g., "mist curled like smoke from a dying candle"); minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but teaches pattern supporting lyric accumulation without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library exile fantasy with interiorizing meditation transforms tropes, risking bold lyric stasis where refusal heightens guardianship stakes; dimensional homesickness and light boundaries feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
