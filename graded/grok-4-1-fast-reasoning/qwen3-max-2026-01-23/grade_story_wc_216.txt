<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in textures felt in veins and sensations, culminating in earned final act of embedding message with visible cost of dissolving; minor slip in mild internal contradiction, more realization than simultaneous impulses, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of sensations building to timeless tapestry (line 74-88), delivering Conceptual Repricing closure as Kael dissolves into light (282), passing legacy with felt cost of borrowed time ending; orientation anchored early, one tightening via glyph press suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emerald silo's humming core and frozen light constrain choices and charge final image (74, 254); selective sensory textures (coarse weave, silken slide) mirror internal states purposefully without catalog; spatial choreography clear in capsule to oak table shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grasping time's texture tightens decisively in timeless sea revelation, narrowing options to embed message before time expires; agency in pressing glyph and penning card forecloses borrowed life with legible cost at dissolution; no major slips touch peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as shared texture emerges organically from sensations and garage sale messages, resonant CR in Elara's clutch reweighting premise without moral; no direct statement, ambiguity in glyph invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biased toward textures, rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise at end; clean POV shift to Elara at 254 serves closure without head-hopping; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., sensations advancing theme and stakes); purposeful texture repetition taught early avoids loops, rhythm varies for propulsion; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (102) doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Shift textures, urn sacrifice, and garage sale codes transforms time trope into inevitable legacy pass-on; risk in lyric timelessness heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
