<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in Kael's absence drive micro-choices like soldering the censer foot; contradictory grief/reclamation impulses act in the ritual build. Final peace earned via prior causality. Minor epiphanic telling in "Tears fell—not of despair, but release" borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from ritual setup to closure RR (visions bloom, peace settles) with legible cost (station broken, grief honored); orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, phone calls motivate ellipsis without coincidence resolving. Pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Censer foot and station dome recur to constrain choices (grounds circuit) and charge final image (warm compass in pocket); sensory details (rosin scent, verdigris texture) selective via navigational POV. Atmosphere mirrors loss geography without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (patchwork hands) evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim love via reverse migration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through moon-constrained builds to circuit climax narrowing options; agency in final wire-join forecloses erasure path. Cost unmistakable in tears/release and un-fixed hydraulics. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of solace in enduring loss emerges organically from ritual images and visions; final bridge across chasm offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting grief. Repetitive "raw solace" and "geography of loss" phrases verge on overt echo, softening ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (loss as terrain, stars as witnesses); rhythmic lyricism modulates from tense build to charged poise at visions. Phone voice subtextual and sparse. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied rhythm, but repetitive phrasing ("geography of loss" x3, "raw solace" x3) creates paraphrase loops across final third; figurative density overwrites peak visions beat without full pattern payoff. Closure image clear despite artifacts. Ignore bracketed counts per policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi ritual grief (censer in space station, phone-oracle guiding memory circuit) transforms tropes; reverse migration inflects turns inevitably from particulars. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently. No derivative templates.</comment>
