<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—protocol vs. conscience—act simultaneously in the interruption beat, earning the transmit choice with embodied fear; minor label-speak like "bravely conflicted" slightly abstracts peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages build tightly from discovery to interruption-triggered transmit (DC) with legible cost in deception risk; single scene holds lens cleanly to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glacial corridors and secret panel constrain transmit tactic and charge final "snow-locked stillness" image; sensory hierarchy (boots' whisper, ice-glow) filters through archivist's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interruption reversal forces agency in transmit, foreclosing protocol path with on-page deception cost; dominant stake tightens causally to reweight options at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths vs. rupture emerges organically from letter release, resonating in final "cradle for a difficult dawn" without moralizing; particulars drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (ice shelves as "forgotten bones") and rhythmic modulation under stress; dialogue subtext shines in Elara's steady "All stable" vs. internal panic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative density peaks slightly overwrought in opening ("cathedral of frozen memory"); no loops, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryo-archive and ghost networks transforms preservation trope into quiet heroism; dormant filaments as constraint feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
