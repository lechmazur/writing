<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in refusal of scarcity versus inventive rebellion act in scene through probing the stone and crafting gears; final triumph earned by causal buildup with embodied tears as cost. Interiority particular via clock-rebellion metaphors tied to hands' precision. No label-speak; flaws like desperation compound before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens: yoyo discovery → reverse-engineering → integration → lever slide enacts DC with tide's indifferent return as felt cost in final image. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (lighthouse, Elara, stone). Single scene holds; no ambiguity, constraint (tide nadir) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse mechanism and stone constrain timing/activation choices; yoyo as micro-setting enables reversal with tactile grooves. Sensory hierarchy (brine, brass, tide lap) biases via inventive gaze, evolving with reversal (prisms ignite). Final beam-stone intersection charges image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse fate via time) signaled early, causal tightening at lever click narrows to defiance with emotional cost (tears through grime). Agency in disengaging clutch forecloses forward-time path; tide inhale complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time's dual flow emerges implicitly from reversal turning "weep" to "awake"; final image reweights scarcity with possibility, no moralizing. Resonance from particulars (stone inscription alchemy) inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with inventive perceptual signature (gear trains, string paths); rhythmic prose modulates from urgency ("chest tightened") to peace. Elevated diction fits lexicon; no elision, compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "cascade of precise clicks"); varied rhythm accelerates at activation. Minor figurative density ("tear in the fabric") purposeful without muddle or loops; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Yoyo-lighthouse reversal synthesizes clockwork ingenuity into fresh CR on famine relic; risk of optical alchemy heightens stakes organically. Transformation of tropes (lighthouse beacon, hunger stone) via inversion feels inevitable.</comment>
