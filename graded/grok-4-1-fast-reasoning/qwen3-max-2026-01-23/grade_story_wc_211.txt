<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied immersion and memory-shiver reveal particular flaws and values; purpose shift from archiving to cultivation earns closure via renunciation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to CR closure in purpose reconfiguration ("Cultivation had begun"); memory beat tightens texturally with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard atop spire and Sentinel Tree constrain awakening (silent apple fall charges prophecy); final blossom recharges setting motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (archive silence's emotion) deepens texturally via prophecy memory, forcing stance crystallization; agency in immersion forecloses old path visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silence-as-seeds motif emerges organically, reweighting disquiet to potential in final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (ink-stained fingers, linguistic ghosts) stable; rhythm heightens pressure from immersion to bloom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., wax syncs heartbeat); metaphors cohere without muddle in peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phonograph shaving as accidental prophecy vessel synthesizes archival lyricism freshly; orchard-spire risks pay off in charged poise.</comment>
