<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to capture presence is concrete and intensifies through micro-choices like aligning the columella; earned personal revaluation at "true value lies not in possession" shows contradictory resolve. Kael/Lyra pressure as crucible without overwhelming her POV. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure in "the density of presence solidify—a tangible warmth," reweighting loss with conceptual cost of vulnerability. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. Lens holds cleanly without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nexus embers and columella curl constrain alchemical choices, flaring in sympathy at climax to charge final image. Sensory details selective via Elara's bias (e.g., "pocket-sun...pulsing against her thigh"). Vivid integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture/revalue presence tightens when secret whispers ("air thickened"), forcing Elara's empathetic weaving; agency in pigment strokes forecloses shame with relational cost. Escalation via density increase under Accumulative lens; subtle but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of love's resolve emerges from particulars like pigments transforming tear; CR reweights premise organically. Final image of aureole clings as non-literal answer. Borders echo in "scientifically romantic truth settled deep," risking statement over resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with scientific-romantic perceptual signature (e.g., "fossilized echo of cosmic geometry"); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation peaks in painting beat. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but figurative overload in painting beat ("chromatic embrace...profound fullness") risks coherence under overwriting check. Minor paraphrase loops around "revalue"; closure image clear. Propulsion strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pocket-sun alchemy premise ingeniously synthesizes science/romance into emotional transmutation; transforms loss trope via specific pigments and nexus. Risky lyric fantasy heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
