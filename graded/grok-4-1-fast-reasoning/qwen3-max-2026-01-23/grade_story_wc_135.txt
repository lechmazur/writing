<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's reactively visionary trait creates embodied contradiction (gift/burden in gasping vision), compelling micro-choices like oiling the valve and staggered sharings that earn her final warmth. Interiority particular via salt-sorrow seizures and phantom chills. Elder Lin's validation forces relational shift, revealing hierarchy of values in honoring silences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of intervals taught by pier note, density builds to Elder's words reconfiguring purpose (RR/Charged Poise). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure cost legible in "you do not erase the hollow spaces," foreclosing flawless reconstruction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivory stones post-rain constrain and evolve (glistening to imprints of feet), charging final archive sanctum. Sensory hierarchy archivist-specific (salt-damp pages, verdigris grooves). Trumpet valve as micro-setting enables pier note, mirroring internal voids.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fragments to meaning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via vision fracture then pier note, narrowing to deliberate pacing with embodied cost (stumbling gasp). Agency in staggered acts crystallizes stance. Fisherman's tears and Elder's murmur deepen communal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilient present via navigated absences emerges from valve vision to child's drawing reprise, reweighting voids without statement. Final image answers "coherent meaning" non-literally via "promise of the next interval." Subtext in silences honors complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with archivist perceptual bias (fragment contours). Voice rhythmic, modulating from violent vision to quiet certainty. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("you do not erase"), distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short gasps to flowing intervals). No loops; figurative purposeful ("emotional geography"). Minor density in opening metaphors purposeful for textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Reactively visionary archivist transforms restoration trope via valve heartening. Staggered intervals freshen healing arc. Risky mosaic taught early pays off in charged poise.</comment>
