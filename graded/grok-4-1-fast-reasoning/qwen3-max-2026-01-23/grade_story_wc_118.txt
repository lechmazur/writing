<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Odd historian's sensitively perceptive trait roots motivation in embodied perception ("hum beneath his skin"), driving micro-choices like tracing diary fragments; endurance against silence earns closure without tidy epiphany. Internal harmony shows no contradictory impulses in scene, but flaw of solitude compounds via vigil's foreseen end. Final palm to wall reveals values hierarchy with cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: diary probe accumulates density to CR closure ("stories would remain, waiting"), reweighting displaced axis with conceptual cost of vigil's end legible in "He knew his own vigil would end." Single scene anchored early (silo library post-last dream). One tightening via Elara's entries narrows to dual axis insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze light shaft and cool metal walls constrain as memory vessels, charging final palm-press image; sensory hierarchy (resonances over visual) reflects POV attunement. Details evolve causally (silence layers with dragon-fire). Recurring walls mirror internal states through action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echoes before dissolution) signaled early, deepens via diary's visceral axis ("sun rose wrong"), forcing endurance; density increase reweights with Elara's dream settling "into the silo's bones." Cost felt in sparse entries and final vigil acknowledgment alters tactics to inscription. Agency in probing sustains under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory mending axis emerges via particulars (tapestry/diaries), final image ("dragons could mend the sky in memory") non-literally answers without moralizing; irony in last dream seeding future via walls. Resonance from Elara's courage avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (wall whispers, dragon eyes watching); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise ("solitary gesture in the vast quiet"). Diction reflects post-dream attunement, no leakage; compression purposeful for lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., tweezers smoothing propels revelation); varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful "quiet/bronze" refrain teaches pattern without loop. Minor paraphrase in silence motifs ("profound hush," "vast quiet") near closure, but no scaffold dulls image. Zero artifacts in peak diary beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-last-dream silo archiving wall-echoes synthesizes fresh angle on apocalypse via tactile preservation; risk of lyric stasis heightens stakes through dragon-sun mend. Transformation test passes: core frame unique to historian's vow.</comment>
