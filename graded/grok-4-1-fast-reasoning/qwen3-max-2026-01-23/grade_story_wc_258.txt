<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's steadily curious nature and Leo's eroded confidence drive consistent motives, with embodied emotions like ink-stained fingers and glistening tears. Micro-choices like inviting Leo and confiding the lineage reveal values under shared grief pressure. Minor label-speak in "steadily curious nature" slightly undercuts interior specificity, but relationships force Leo's recognition with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from Elara's solitary mapping to shared revelation, culminating in Charged Poise closure via Leo's tears and map gift—"Tears glistened in Leo’s eyes—not of sorrow, but recognition." Orientation anchors early (loft, post-crash context by para 2); cost legible in foreclosed isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "sharp, mineral tang of onyx ink" and rain-beaded skylight filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal adaptation. Skylight evolves to charge final image—"moonlight pierced the skylight, illuminating the onyx ink... like a constellation." Constrains choices via drafting table proximity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping adaptation amid disillusionment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via confiding method, forcing Leo's stance crystallization. Agency in Elara's invitation and demonstration narrows isolation options; cost felt in "grief was not isolation, but a thread." Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate mapping of inherited collapse patterns emerges organically from ink trails and journal sketch, reweighted in final image without statement. Subtext in Leo's reflected choices invites ambiguity on resilience; resonates via "the compassion with which we map it is uniquely ours."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual bias (cartographic noticing); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to intimate. Dialogue natural/subtextual—"I reverse engineer the aftershocks"—distinguishes voices without on-page convergence. No head-hopping; diction fits Elara's inherited idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied syntax breathes with scene. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("nervous system in deep black ink," "constellation of collective healing") during peak reveal risks muddle, but pattern-taught and closure-clear. No loops or scaffolds; read-aloud rhythm strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy as cultural reverse-engineering post-crypto crash transforms collapse tropes via measuring tape and ink hypotheses. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes organically; "multiplying paths" turn inevitable from established method.</comment>
