<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete embodiment like "lungs still tasted of smoke" roots resilience; final transformation choice earned via prior flight and frost-guided memory, with contradictory fear/purpose impulses acting in reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frost density deepens recollections into Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "scarred spirit" and foreclosed victimhood path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frost patterns constrain retracing choice and charge final dawn image; sensory hierarchy (frost veins mirroring ledger) reflects glass-artist POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of purpose tightens texturally via frost revelation narrowing escape to adaptive creation; agency in renunciation (not destroy ledger) with studio-loss cost visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sphere image reweights art-crime entanglement non-literally, emerging from ash/light particulars; lingering ambiguity in "ever-changing hues" resists tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (light in silica, crystalline veins) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates hush to resolve, eliding backstory efficiently via frost anchors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration; minor paraphrase loop in repeated "scorched testament" (3x) dulls one reflective beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost-decoded ledger to light-casting orb synthesizes trauma/resilience ingeniously; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes organically from glass-artist frame.</comment>
