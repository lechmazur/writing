<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from seeking endings to honoring continuity, embodied in her grip shifting from loose to firm on the net; internal conflict layers curiosity against volunteering pull. Lars as secondary applies subtle pressure via journal. Minor diagnostic edge in "sharp certainty...softened into quiet curiosity" but anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from waking vibrations to journal find and final breath realization as Resonant Reconfiguration (CR), reweighting premise with emotional cost of delayed isolation. Orientation anchored early in Arctic outpost. Single scene coheres without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parasol tip as recurring micro-setting constrains reflection and charges final aurora-glow image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (ice groan in bones, wind sigh) filters through Elara's priorities, guiding net-haul choices amid slush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn ending's sound) tightens via journal's textual density break, forcing endurance over resignation; cost legible in foreclosed isolation as she chooses fire-sharing. Accumulative escalation reweights to survival's symphony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of endings as woven resonance emerges organically from ice cracks, journal, breath; final image non-literally answers central question without moralizing. Parasol reprise shifts from loss to compass, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in tactile anchors (hemp, porcelain); lyrical rhythm modulates from groan to lullaby. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven in Lars's whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loops ("windborne solace" x3, "sound...not void but resonance") and repetitive stems ("The [noun] was no longer...but") dull reflective beats; template cadence in epiphanic shifts like "fold in patience...cradle." Closure image clear despite overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism with Arctic nets/journal transforms death trope into textured continuity; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in breath-as-song CR without gimmick.</comment>
