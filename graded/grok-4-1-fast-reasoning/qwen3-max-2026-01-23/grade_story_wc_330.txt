<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to interpret silence as possibility drives concrete micro-choices like entering the carriage and singing, with embodied contradiction in her shaking breath before voice strengthens. Interiority ties to carpenter's hands and memory of Lily, avoiding stock phrases. Final renunciation of silence feels earned via prior causality, with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds from misting hush to glowing halo and song, yielding Charged Poise closure when fragment clicks and peace settles, with cost of breaking 12-year silence legible in "shook her frame." Orientation anchored early in highway detour and forest train; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (chimes carving time, sunlight fracturing on walnut) filters through carpenter's bias toward potential in decay. Recurring wind bells and halo constrain choices (invitation to sing, seamless join) and charge final image. Atmosphere evolves causally from hush to symphony, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (silence vs. healing through song) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via memory cue and expectant hush, forcing agency in singing with on-page cost (wavering voice, shook frame). Pressure coheres without reversal overload; resolution via stance crystallization forecloses void-silence path. Cost unmistakable in resonance felt in wood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility emerges organically from particulars (hush expectant, ghost music blueprint), reweighted in final image of clear road/heart without moral statement. Subtext in halo's memory-pulse and song's swirl invites ambiguity on loss's fertility. Protagonist arc inextricable from question; resonant non-literal answer in smile after chime.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (hands fluent in wood grain, stillness as blueprint). Poetic diction/rhythm modulates purposefully from hush to strengthening melody, maintaining perceptual bias. No dialogue or head-hopping; compression legible under accumulative lens, eliding for texture payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pushing open groaning door" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax purposeful. Motif recurrence (whispering gleam, misting hush) taught early without muddle or loops. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (e.g., dust motes' dance) contained, not touching closure; no scaffold or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carpenter's silence meeting carousel relic transforms abandonment tropes via halo-song healing. Particulars like sea-glass bells and obsidian eyes feel organic, not checklist. Risky lyric compression heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry; inevitable hindsight in wrong turn as compass.</comment>
