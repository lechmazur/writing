<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots clearly in emancipation-driven quest; embodied emotions peak concretely when "button a cool anchor of hope against her palm." Minor epiphanic polish at "quiet mending begin within her" borders unearned but anchors to prior dust cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from dust anomaly to envelope unfurl; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands decisively in final image of "future...page waiting for gentle hands," with legible emotional cost of reframed loneliness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dust patterns as micro-setting constrain pivotal choice (pressing seam) and charge closure philosophy; sensory selectivity (faint hum, grime silhouette) reflects archival urgency without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify kindnesses) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via anomaly discovery narrowing to personal kinship; agency in careful handling forecloses isolation path with felt cost in "sorrow did not deepen; it softened."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of compassion in margins emerges organically from button/note particulars; resonant non-literal answer in streetlamp glow reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (dust as "truth whispered"); rhythmic modulation suits reflective pressure, diction controlled and archival-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density, but "quiet" repetition (compass, mending, rebellion) creates minor loop across reflections; stacked metaphors ("tapestry of dust," "seeds in barren soil") purposeful yet verge on muddle in peak discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust-pattern method offers fresh archival ingenuity transforming trope discovery; button synthesis feels inevitable, risking lyric reflection for deepened emotional specificity.</comment>
