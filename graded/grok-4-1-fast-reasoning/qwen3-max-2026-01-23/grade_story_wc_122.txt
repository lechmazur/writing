<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied numbness fracturing at drum strike ("tears welled as the emotional numbness fractured") with contradictory grief/necessity impulses acting in offering needle and receiving vibrations; earned change via tactile progression reveals character-particular values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to RR closure in final drum stillness and homeward walk; legible cost in "numbness dissolved like mist" reconfigures silence from void to connection, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cavern's "stone walls and hanging hides swallowed every echo" as micro-setting constrains to bodily listening and charges final "silent song...against her ribs"; sensory hierarchy tactile-biased, purposeful without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early tightens accumulatively via etched drum play narrowing to tactile agency; cost unmistakable in shoulders softening and tears, charging Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as "fertile ground" emerges organically from vibration particulars, resonant non-literal answer in needle's transformation reweighting hush without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature tactilely biased ("palms flat against the cool hide"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure at climax without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure, purposeful metaphors coherent (e.g., "filament of hush" taught early); minor density slip in stacked images around "tactile symphony" nudges from peak without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of phonograph vibrations etched to drum transforms silence trope via specific tactile logic; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
