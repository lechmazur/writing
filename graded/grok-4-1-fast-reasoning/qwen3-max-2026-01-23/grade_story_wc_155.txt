<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (e.g., "quiet ache," tears of "gratitude"); contradictory impulses in pensive mirth harmonize sorrow/joy; micro-choices like embedding fragment earn transformation with visible emotional cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure where fragment embedding reweights lost joy as "permanent photograph," with conceptual cost of time's passage legible in "thoughtful sorrow...bubbling joy."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog as recurring "micro-setting" constrains/enables core light-film action and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (visual photons, ghost-sounds, perfume) filtered through artist's priorities integrates seamlessly with choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via light developing full fresco, forcing agency in fragment integration; cost unmistakable in "wave of pensive mirth" reconfiguring inner landscape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of joy via active remembrance emerges organically from light-bridge image and fragment act; resonant CR in final realization avoids moralizing, though "joy lives in honoring what was" borders directness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (photons as pigment); stable close-POV modulates rhythmically with intensity, compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("tactile whisper," "luminous dialogue") slightly muddles peak projection beat without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-as-film developing fog-memory transforms artist trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via fragment alignment.</comment>
