<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to nurture wonder drives adaptive micro-choices like mirroring Liam's breath, earning his shift without force; interiority embodied in swelling heart and quiet vow. Liam's change feels credible via tension-to-awe progression. Minor label-speak ("softly adaptive") slightly genericizes but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from melody invitation to eclipse hush, landing Charged Poise closure in Liam's tearful smile and "the link is real," reconfiguring dimmed curiosity with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early via path and oak. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sagebrush perfume, dreaming roots, and eclipse progression constrain seating and shared gaze, charging closure image; sensory hierarchy (earthy scents, coppery light) mirrors Elara's priorities. Details tactile and evolving, like coolness rising. Recurring roots/oak reweight final hush humming with connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle Liam's wonder) signaled via dimmed curiosity, tightens accumulatively through posture ease to eclipse awe, forcing Elara's renunciation of force for presence; agency in curl handoff forecloses isolation path. Cost legible in Liam's tear amid radiant smile. Minor: stakes more emotional than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ordinary magic theme emerges organically from curl-to-cosmos link, reweighting personal memory against infinite sky without statement; final spiderweb chatter offers non-literal answer to wonder's endurance. Subtext in shared silence/gesture builds complexity. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in musical/sensory noticing (gentle chords, resonant melody); voice lyrical yet grounded, modulating to hush under eclipse pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It's getting dark"), goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm varies with scene (short hushed sentences at eclipse), high density in sensory integration; minor paraphrase loops ("softly adaptive," "ordinary magic" reprise without fresh pressure) and figurative density border overwriting in setup. Closure image propels cleanly. No filter stacks or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse therapy via baby curl linking intimate past to celestial now transforms mentoring trope; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens emotional specificity without gimmick. Details particular (honey-blond curl, dew-jeweled web). Organic to voice.</comment>
