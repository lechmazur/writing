<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (memory labyrinth threat) act in scene via climb micro-choice, earning final release with cost of shedding resentment; traits shown concretely through ritual actions without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from forgiveness anchor to carving closure as Conceptual Repricing, with ascent tightening clarity; orientation anchored early ("umbral grotto"); cost legible in "release the final shards" decision crystallized at tree perch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basin and yew tree constrain choices (carving site, thinking elevation) and charge final image ("thumb over the smooth, new groove"); sensory details (drips, moss scent, bark knots) selectively bias POV and evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment via release) signaled early, tightens via tree-climb deepening that narrows resentment path; agency in carving forecloses with felt cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (rebirth/contentment in acts) emerges organically from particulars like cloud cycle mirroring heart and scallop as forgiveness mark; final basin groove offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (cycles in clouds/stone/moss); rhythmic syntax modulates from meditative ascent to precise carving intensity, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful in lyric pattern (e.g., "clouds gathering into majestic peaks"), propels without overwriting in peak carving beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grotto rituals and ancestral hairpin transforms forgiveness trope; risk-taking in sustained lyric ascent/descent heightens internal stakes organically.</comment>
