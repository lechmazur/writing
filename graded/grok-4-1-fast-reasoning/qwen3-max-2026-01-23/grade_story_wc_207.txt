<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in psychometry beat (panic to calm), compelling earned renunciation of answers with embodied tears and lightness; sensibly eccentric traits shown precisely without labels dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via sensory/textural buildup to CR closure ("weight of needing answers dissolved," final compass-to-grace image); orientation anchored by word 18, cost legible in surrender beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lagoon's impossible arcs and still water constrain explanation quest, mirror internal shift, and charge final hush image; sensory hierarchy (mineral scent, resonant hush) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explanations-fail threshold) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via psychometry reversal to surrender; agency in reading compass/returning it forecloses collection with felt lightness cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of awe-over-explanation emerges organically from compass/lagoon particulars, reweighted in final non-literal image ("calibrated not to north, but to grace"); ambiguity in ineffable invites without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (scent-whispers, mineral ghosts); rhythmic modulation peaks in psychometry flood, diction biased to sensibly eccentric hush-notice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., lantern sweeps illuminate deposition and silence); hush repetition purposeful for tone but borders loop in silence beats, no scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh psychometry-petrichor synthesis transforms cave trope into hinged truth quest; risk of quiet CR pays off inevitably from particulars without retreat.</comment>
