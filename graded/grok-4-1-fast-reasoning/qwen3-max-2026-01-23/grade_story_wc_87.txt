<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in simultaneous pole-counting and surging memories; earned change peaks when compass needle settles, reconciling scar with calling without tidy erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pole-counting density builds to abrupt end (pattern break), forcing skyward gaze and RR closure; cost legible in "scar, yes, but also the enduring love," reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Utility poles as micro-setting constrain navigation until cliffs void them, charging pivot; sensory hierarchy (salt spray/tears, humming wires) mirrors internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (earthbound navigation for alignment) tightens via pole-ending reversal, forcing trade-off with felt cost (shameful tears); agency in securing compass narrows path under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of integrating regret/courage emerges via particulars (splintered poles to steadfast needle); final shanty hum offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (nautical bias: stars as "true north," poles as "wooden anchor"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in surf-launch, breathes in epiphany.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors ("diamond needle stitching night to day"); minor overuse of "gravitate"/"backlash" frays texture slightly mid-reflection but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pole penance vs. stellar trust transforms navigator trope; risk in hybrid terrestrial/celestial method heightens stakes organically.</comment>
