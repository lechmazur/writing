<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in simultaneous timeline shards create visceral ache, propelling rune-traced micro-choices to earned release; final acceptance forecloses avoidance loop with integrated cost. Minor whisper feels prompted but anchors resolve without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via emotional density buildup in procedural shards to RR closure; tablet release with "I accept all that I am" reconfigures timelines with undeniable conceptual cost in fused river image. Orientation anchors instantly; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Viaduct slickness and body inversion constrain opening navigation; labyrinth geometry (crystallized laughter chasms) mirrors emotional state, charging final mended bridge image. Sensory selection purposeful, POV-biased without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-labyrinth conquest) tightens accumulatively via rune-deepening (Shame to Compassion), narrowing to release agency; dissonance ache and loop paralysis deliver felt prices shaping final transcendence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of fractured self-to-whole emerges organically from procedural shards weaving into mosaic; final tear-ripple chime offers non-literal resonance reweighting regret into embraced flow without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (inverted shadows, pulsing runes) biases details metaphysically; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in dissonance beat, with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated image-action; minor "procedural generation" loops (−0.4) and dense figuration in peak labyrinth don't obscure closure fusion. Varied syntax/rhythm passes ear test; no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Procedural self-labyrinth and tear-ripple frame synthesize bold metaphysics into inevitable release; risk of inverted/gravity-defying mosaic heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
