<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in embodied micro-choices like weaving regret into fibers, earning purpose evolution; minor slip in label-speak like "snowmelt ardor" slightly abstracts emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering to rope's final click releasing voices; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration with legible emotional cost in tears dissolving sorrow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice walls and aurora constrain reconfiguration and charge final humming sanctum image; selective sensory weave (chime, fiber whisper) mirrors caster priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve names tightens via patient braiding to illumination release; one deepening suffices under accumulative lens, with weariness as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Forgiveness-as-mold theme emerges organically via lost wax parallel and names cascade; final "keeper of echoes" image resonantly reweights loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature in reverent hand details; lyrical rhythm modulates to buoyant close without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion in fiber-whisper beats; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors like "liquid dawn" slightly dulls peak release density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of punched card, rope braids, and ice voices transforms memory preservation trope; risk in ritual specificity heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
