<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied grief during scent-triggered memory ("Hot tears streamed... scattering tiny, crystalline shadows") reveals contradictory impulses of caution versus ache, earning the final acceptance of tears as "light's meaning"; minor over-articulation in epiphany slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ritual anticipation to midnight chime and scent drop, culminating in CR via vial inscription reveal ("For my Elara...") with legible emotional cost of remembrance; single tightening at drop holds cleanly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse's fractured moonlight and UV lamps constrain revelation (lily veins, vial script) and charge final image, with POV-filtered sensory hierarchy (scents over tools) mirroring internal shift; recurrent "crystal shadows" evolves purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tear triggers) deepens via scent drop under Accumulative lens, narrowing avoidance to endurance with on-page cost in sustained tears ("did not stem her tears"); agency in uncorking forces trade-off, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory's bittersweet light/shadow emerges organically from vial message and final realization, reweighting premise without moralizing; slight explicitness ("love... persists beyond visibility") in closing lines prevents peak resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward luminescence/scent stable in single POV, modulating rhythm from reverence ("quiet reverence that bordered on prayer") to awe; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or artifacts, even in peak grief beat; figurative consistency ("crystal shadows") enhances without muddling, with precise syntax supporting sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lantern brokerage, extinct flora ritual, and scent-memory vial transforms memory trope into inevitable CR; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
