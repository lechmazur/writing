<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied tears and feather tremble; contradictory solitude vs. connection impulses act in waiting and release; final renunciation earned by prior sensory cues and memory without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tracing constellations to firefly pulse reweighting belonging stake; CR closure via feather release with emotional cost legible in "tiny dark seed against the brightening sky"; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent anemones and crystal dome constrain ascent and charge viewport moment; sensory hierarchy (cold brass, ocean sigh) reflects Elara's priorities; recurring feather as micro-setting evolves to alter final release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rhythm of belonging) signaled early, tightens via vibration-to-crack deepening under textural lens; agency in feather-guided pursuit forecloses isolation path with tear-traced cost at fireflies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of practiced belonging emerges from feather's arc (loss to release) without statement; final image reconfigures memory-fireflies link non-literally, reweighting premise with fragile beauty's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shadowseam wonder" and biased noticing (celestial on drowned streets); rhythmic modulation peaks at "horizon bleed from indigo to violet"; stable single POV with lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "burnt feather... dipped in cultured plankton" advances plot/character); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors, no loops; minor repetition of key phrases pattern-taught for resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrology-underwater with feather's transformation; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight via firefly bridge.</comment>
