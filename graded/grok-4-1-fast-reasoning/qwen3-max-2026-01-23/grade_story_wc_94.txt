<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses vividly embodied in "furiously tranquil" posture vibrating with unuttered truths, compelling the shift to writing as earned change with emotional cost in sob and tears. Interiority particular to censored poet, no stock epiphanies. Final choice to pen verses forecloses silenced endurance with legible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vigil pause to letter discovery and timer chime, yielding CR closure where scars reconfigure as guides, cost legible in shattered composure and rarefied clarity. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Observatory's curved glass, high-altitude rarefying air, and storm constrain epiphany, stripping artifice and charging final palm-to-window harmony. Sensory details (lightning flashes, timer tick) filtered through poet's priorities, evolve with emotional storm. Micro-objects like timetable enable discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vigil to map scars) signaled early, tightens via letter's constellations insight and timer chime, narrowing to writing with agency in breaking seal and steadying hand. Cost unmistakable in dam-shattering sob foreclosing prior suspension. Lens escalation via deepening resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scars-as-cartography theme emerges organically from letter's negative spaces and final poem folding beside it, reweighting censorship as refinement without statement. Resonant non-literal close: scars illuminate empathy paths. Complexity in grief's maps avoids tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (storm-kissed tableaus, scar topography) modulates from furious tension to storm-washed peace, stable close third-person POV. Rhythmic control heightens pressure, no elision issues. Distinct texture fits poet without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm suits lyric mode; purposeful "rarefy" recurrence taught early. Minor metaphor density in peak sob beat ("new rivers... hidden topography") borders overwrite but coheres without muddle. No loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censorship scars as constellations via darkroom timer and bus-timetable envelope transforms vigil trope into rarefied purpose. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from early seeds to dawn poem.</comment>
