<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Doll's transformation from confinement token to release witness earns character change with embodied cost in weightlessness; occasional diagnostic labels like "bone-deep claustrophobia" slightly abstract interiority without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to gravity inversion and CR closure (doll nested in sprout reconfigures legacy with emotional cost legible in "rewritten her relationship with space"); orientation anchored immediately, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Xenial trellis constrains choice (tethers during inversion) and charges final image via sprout; sensory details like "liquid amber poured over her skin" integrate purposefully, mirroring internal expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect hush to transmute phobia) tightens via inversion deepening options into textured presence; agency in disciplined focus forecloses dread path with felt release cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sprout's inverted growth offers resonant non-literal answer to legacy vs. freedom question, reweighting "silence" motif from bunker contraction to sky expansion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias (silence flavors as vintages); rhythmic modulation heightens inversion hush, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "honeyed light" propelling texture; minor paraphrase loops on "silence" (e.g., "gilded hush... silence with texture") in peak beat dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence flavors, inverted gravity hush, and xenial sprouting transforms phobia trope into inevitable CR; risk-taking in textural lens heightens stakes organically.</comment>
