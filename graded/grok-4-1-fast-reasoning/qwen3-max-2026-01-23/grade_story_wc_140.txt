<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's erasure-rooted hunger for memory textures drives concrete micro-choices like reverent label-smoothing; embodied contradiction in hollow pursuit anchors purpose without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via fragment density to Charged Poise closure; label keystone triggers deepening reconfiguration of namelessness into witness role, hollow cost legible in "anchored his own unmoored spirit."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tide-revealed fragments and container shelter constrain collection rhythm; perceptual filter (cranes as punctuation) charges foghorn final image, sensory specificity mirrors internal hollow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of textural recovery tightens decisively via label layering, narrowing erasure hollow with felt cost of transient purpose; agency in patient archaeology coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically via sensory reconstruction over rumor, resonating in Thorne's "quiet agency" revelation that reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (rust stains as "ghost of a story") stable and biased; rhythmic modulation builds to fog-as-possibility poise, elisions taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "texture"/"fragments" recurrence teaches pattern; no loops or muddle, syntax varies to propel layering climax without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fragment archaeology in container vessels transforms erasure trope via textural synthesis; bold lyric accumulation risks pay off in inevitable witness cadence.</comment>
