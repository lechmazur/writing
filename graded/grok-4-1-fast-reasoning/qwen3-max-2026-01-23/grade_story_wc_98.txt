<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between empirical verification and whimsical faith act vividly in the planting beat despite doubt; final certainty earned via prior dream interpretation with embodied cost in "voice steady despite luminous doubt." Minor diagnostic phrasing like "empirical mind noted" slightly abstracts peak emotion but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to on-page RR/CR closure: seed planting triggers silence-doubt-petal-eruption sequence reconfiguring memory as living truth. Orientation anchored early in ridge climb; cost legible in doubt nearly swallowing her before golden luminescence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silver-veined blossoms and standing stones constrain planting choice and charge final ridge glow image as resilient constellation; sensory details (petrichor, stone hums) evolve causally with memory flood, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect memory pre-monsoon) signaled early tightens via dream interpretation to silence reversal, forcing endurance with legible cost in doubt; agency in humming/planting drives awakening under Accumulative lens, reweighting options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of evidence-imagination symbiosis emerges organically from particulars like reversed river dream and bioluminescent proof; final image of ridge drinking storm offers resonant non-literal answer. Minor articulation in closing lines ("wonder and inquiry walk hand in hand") borders echo but ties to prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with empirical-whimsical perceptual signature (noting "measurable proof" amid lived truths); rhythmic lyricism modulates from doubt-charged ascent to soaring closure without slippage. Perceptual bias filters setting purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (liquid sunlight roots) propelling accumulation; minor figurative density in climax ("liquid starlight," "fallen constellation") risks overload but supports textural lens without obscuring eruption beat. No loops; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (dream ritual, ancestral memory) transformed via empirically whimsical reality checker confronting lived history; ridge-memory symbiosis feels inevitable, with risk-taking lyric accumulation heightening stakes organically.</comment>
