<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaela's post-ego death void drives clear motivation to vivify, with contradictory embrace of numbness as canvas earning change at "Warmth flooded Kaela’s chest, shattering numbness completely." Minor diagnostic labels like "ego death" slightly abstract interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to on-page RR closure at "The fluid glowed gold... Warmth flooded," reconfiguring numbness with felt emotional cost; orientation anchored early in dojo/brain setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo and rewriting history below vividly constrain ritual choices and mirror internal void, charging final image of drifting dojo with integrated souls; selective sensory integration via palms on glass, wind whispers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to defeat numbness tightens accumulatively through harmonizing opposites, forcing renunciation of isolation with legible cost in shattered numbness; agency in palms-on-glass ritual forecloses solitude path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness from opposites emerges organically via union of void/storm, resonant non-literal answer in final breath feeling wind/wood/light without moralizing; custody irrelevance reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature ("abyss below mirroring the hollow space") modulates rhythm under ritual pressure; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in "I am the silence... You are the storm’s memory."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("slices through pretense" x3, history rewriting x4, opposites motif churn) and dense fig lang in most peak sentences dull propulsion; template short-sentence cadence across ending creates drumbeat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego-death void + vivified clone brain via opposites on rewriting-history dojo transforms clone trope into symbiotic creation; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
