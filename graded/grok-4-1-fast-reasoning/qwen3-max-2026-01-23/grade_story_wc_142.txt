<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (orderly plans vs. intuitive flourishes) act simultaneously in graffiti scenes, earning the closure balance of allegiances with felt cost in "tight knot of hopeful desperation."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as graffiti encoding accumulates community activation toward Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "fragile hope take root" amid impending skiffs, with orientation anchored by first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices via shadowed alleyways and raft structures for hidden work; Ferris wheel and spice market murals charge pivotal encoding beats and final flickering lights image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (navigate erasure) signaled early tightens via Elara's addition igniting network spread under Accumulative lens; agency in reorganizing forecloses futile resistance with desperation cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilient encoding emerges organically from graffiti-as-nervous-system image, resonating in final "music swelled—not a dirge, but a resilient anthem" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (geometric precision in chaotic carnival); rhythmic control heightens encoding pressure without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; minor paraphrase in early reflection ("dual allegiance that strained his spirit") slightly dulls but does not touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft-city carnival and graffiti resistance transforms gentrification trope; risk in invisible network payoff feels inevitable from orderly-intuitive encoding.</comment>
