<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices, like swaying body separating crimson thread from censure while defying lullaby's pull, reveal dedication amid contradiction. Minor abstract epiphany at end ("kinship with every liberated soul") borders unearned without rawer flaw exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via thread density building to central knot dissolution—"prismatic sparks hanging... like promise"—delivering Charged Poise RR with legible mental cost ("sweat... immense"). Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt; persistent thread constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "snow lay like crushed pearls upon mercury-hued stone" filter through bodily poetic POV, constraining visibility of threads and charging final image of falling snow over resonant silence. Sensory hierarchy fits ritual urgency; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock via untangling) tightens accumulatively to central knot, narrowing options with agency-driven escalation and embodied cost ("sweat traced paths through frost"); final harvest forecloses conformity path under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's rebellion emerges organically from untangling silenced echoes, culminating in resonant non-literal answer—"unkillable seed of remembrance"—reweighting conformity's lullaby without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("bodily poetic certainty"); rhythmic compression modulates under stress, as in "hands became instruments of truth," teaching lyric pattern early with legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax, but dense figuratives ("serpents of captured starlight") border overwriting in peak untangling without full sparsity, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaste courtesan ritualistically untangling time-threads transforms tropes; bold poetic risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "liminal breath" pattern payoff.</comment>
