<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Solid interiority with embodied remorse (tears tracing dust, pounding heart at music box recognition) and motivation rooted in grief-fueled ritual; contradictory sorrow/hope impulses act in the capture beat, earning shift to "keeper of echoes." Final renunciation of flight (etching jar for Elara) shows hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Minor reflection tilt borders BRR limit but anchors to concrete cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual setup to harmony-weaving capture (cumulative 149), tightening to Charged Poise RR at sealing/etching ("apology, a legacy, a key") with felt cost of years lost in tears. Single scene, early orientation (dunes loft at dawn by para 1), no ambiguity. Closure reconfigures remorse into daily path, legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (ink/salt hands on jars, metallic clicks threading loft) reflects POV priorities; jars as micro-setting constrain ritual and charge final image ("library of love... captured sunsets"). Atmosphere mirrors internal lonesome splendor evolving to sacred hum. Dunes/loft guide solitude's choices without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve/heal via capture) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at music box recognition (cumulative 94) narrowing to generational bridge; agency in willful capture forecloses grief-isolation with tear-cost legibility. One tightening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise without reversal need. Moral calculus (regret vs. offering) sharpens peak without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of captured love enduring emerges organically from jar ritual and music box reprise, reweighting remorse to "stitch mending time’s torn fabric" in final image without statement. Subtext in wistful tenderness layers ambiguity of loss/solace; resonant non-literal close ("promise: love... never forgotten") invites reflection via particulars. No moralizing, complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (sky "bled from indigo to pearl," motes "danced in slivers") biases toward fragile vibrations; stable single-POV distance modulates with wistful intensity, syntax/rhythm reflecting ritual mind. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression legible under Accumulative lens, eliding for emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High fig density ("cascade of notes... ghost returning," "sound-wings") risks coherence in reflective beats but voice-motivated; minor paraphrase loops ("gleaned redemption," wistful repeats) and synonym churn (silence/whisper/sigh) dull propulsion slightly without obscuring closure. Rhythmic variety strong, info-dense lines advance ritual; no template cadence or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise of sound-jars as redemption vessels transforms vagrant trope via tactile ritual and generational bridge; music box synthesis feels inevitable, risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens emotional specificity without gimmick. No derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity in "translator" frame.</comment>
