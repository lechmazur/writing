<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied contradiction in "haunted euphoria" during steaming—joy and ache tangle physically; final chest shift earns renunciation via ritual causality without epiphany shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density crescendos to RR closure at "weight...shifted from lead to light," with legible cost in released sorrow; orientation anchors immediately in path-to-sea opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains kneeling ritual and charges final gaze as resilient symbol; sensory selectivity (salt-mist kiss on ink) mirrors internal renewal without catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate grief to joy) tightens accumulatively through ink-strokes narrowing to new words; cost viscerally felt in "sorrow’s weight" release, though slightly abstract phrasing tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-as-flow emerges via locket-to-paper tether reweighting moments from stones to blossoms; resonant non-literal close in cottage beacon avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct archivist perceptual signature in "gently thorough precision"; rhythmic modulation peaks crisply at wind-lifted paper without distance slips or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric figures (e.g., "fragrant waterfall") taught early pays off at closure; minor figurative density in ritual steps risks slight overwrit but coheres without loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink ritual on blooming jetty transforms grief trope into tactile renewal; risk-taking lyric compression heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
