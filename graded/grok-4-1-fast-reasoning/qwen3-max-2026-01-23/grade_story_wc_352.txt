<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism-mind uniquely shapes perceptions and choices, like decoding the doodle's cartography; past failure earns the triumphant tears in the cavern. Embodied resolve ("latent blaze") layers with anxiety effectively. Minor abstraction in emotional labels slightly tempers peak individuation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and pattern recognition build to CR closure: realization that combinations are "seeds of vigilance" reweights quest with cultivation imperative, cost legible in past failure's echo and inversion's brevity. Orientation anchored early via Codex and peninsula. Single scene flows seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inverted stalactites and vigilance-seed glow constrain path and charge discovery; chronometer as tool shapes timing. Mist and fissure evolve with inversion, mirroring internal blaze. Sensory hierarchy (geological whispers, luminous pulse) filters through prism-bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock vaults via combinations) tightens via precise celestial alignment post-failure, escalating density under Accumulative lens; agency in threshold step forecloses late-arrival risk with felt time cost. Inversion hum forces crystallization. One deepening suffices flawlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance as active planting emerges organically from doodle-to-seed arc; final "clandestinely luminous smile" offers non-literal answer, reweighting erasure with forward legacy sans moralizing. Subtext in moon-triggered glow lingers ambiguously potent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with prism-signature ("perceive emotional residue"); lyrical rhythm modulates from anxious mist to reverent glow without drift. Compression in inversion passage heightens immediacy. No elision issues; perceptual bias distinct.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; rhythm breathes with inversion's hum-to-blaze cadence. Minor repetition ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze") risks loop but stays voice-motivated. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gravity inversion and Fibonacci seeds synthesize fresh fantasy logic, transforming archive trope via physics-bending quest; risk in non-causal Accumulative closure pays off inevitably at "seeds dimmed like cooling embers."</comment>
