<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in brittle devotion, shown through micro-choices like adjusting the conduit and trusting subtle hum over magic. Earned change via accumulated observation forecloses forceful spells with felt fatigue. Minor label-speak ("earnestly naive heart") shown via persistence against ridicule, not diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drops build density to hum, ripple, chime as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost ("one ring would not refill the sea"). Orientation anchored early (viaduct, cove, dawn by para 1). No orientation debt; closure cost legible in final stitch image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct constrains method (weeping rails supply particles), charges final gleam. Sensory hierarchy (plink, hum, light shards) reflects observation urgency; evolves causally (sun ignites drips). Micro-setting (reed conduits, mat) tactile, lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend bell for balance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via drip rhythm to vibration deepening options. Agency in attention forecloses force; cost in ongoing dawns felt at zenith chime. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of perception-alchemy emerges via particulars (drips catalyze wholeness); final fish leap reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in naive armor vs. ridicule; ambiguity lingers in partial heal. No moralizing; resonance from drop-to-chime arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in drip counts and star whispers. Rhythmic control modulates (short counts under focus, flowing reflection). Purposeful compression taught early, paid in chime cadence; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (heartbeat counts to hours bleeding); no loops or scaffolds. Figurative consistent in lyric pattern (gemstones, weave), no muddle in peak (chime eruption). Minor overwriting in openings contained pre-pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dripping physics as magic transforms tropes; risk in plausible impossibility heightens stakes via patient accumulation. Inevitable hindsight from journals to fish leap; no derivatives, bold perceptual alchemy.</comment>
