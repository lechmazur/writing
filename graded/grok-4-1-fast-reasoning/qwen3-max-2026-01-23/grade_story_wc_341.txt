<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in loss, with contradictory fear/peace impulses shown in turbulence spike yielding to "Peace" log; quietly explosive trait enables calm observation amid drift. Final cathartic sob and journal entry earn change with emotional cost. Minor diagnostic labels like "anxiety" slightly abstract peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cloud observations build density to fallstreak hole CR, reweighting premise that "empty spaces remember" with legible emotional cost in sob and final entry. Orientation anchored immediately in gondola drift. Single continuous scene fits scope perfectly, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (cool brass, velvet dark, ink tear) filtered through meteorological bias constrain choices and charge hole image. Gondola drift and clouds evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Final "dusty starlight" recharges setting motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove memory in absence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via turbulence fear, nimbostratus grief, to hole deepening that crystallizes acceptance. Agency in persistent logging forecloses doubt with cathartic cost. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in some stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-memory emerges organically from cloud particulars to hole's "negative imprint," offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Final image reweights prior observations; ambiguity in "geometric silence" invites lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (vapor emotions, sky ghosts); rhythmic modulation heightens drift pressure to crystalline vision. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged closure. No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("quietly explosive," "spooled wholeness") and figurative density in mid-beats slightly dull momentum without obscuring hole peak. Peak closure image clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological fancy and grief architecture yields inevitable hole proof; risky lyric risk-taking (emotion-clouds) heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes; bold premise transformed through specifics.</comment>
