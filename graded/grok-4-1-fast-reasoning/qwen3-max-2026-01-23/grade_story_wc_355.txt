<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in pacifist traits compel the ritual; micro-choices like dialing reveal values. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphany ("path to empathy" diagnostic echo) at peak without full embodied contradiction. Final endurance of another's grief earns change with tears as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence builds to RR (Charged Poise in calm amid fireworks). Orientation anchored immediately in workshop/clasp. Closure cost legible in "tears traced clean paths" and inscribed ledger, reconfiguring isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop/resonator as micro-setting constrains tuning action; stars/fireworks contrast charges final image of "gentle, resonant silence." Sensory hierarchy (hum, warmth, chime) POV-biased and purposeful. No white-room; tactile navigation vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover silence) signaled early; accumulative escalation via frequency lock deepens to emotional wave, narrowing to empathy's cost (tears, becoming Henderson). Agency in dialing forecloses force path. Fireworks complicate but do not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy emerges organically from ritual/recovery, resonant in final bridge of silent presence. Subtext in thawing clasp mirrors loss; avoids moralizing but minor "path to empathy" echoes slightly overt. Final image reweights silence as connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (silence textures) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from anticipatory to calm. Murmur to clasp carries sincerity subtext. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; minor figurative density ("ghost of a tear," "calcified regret") in opening but thins at climax. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies, anchors voice. Slight paraphrase in silence descriptors but does not dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-cataloging resonator transforms empathy trope into tactile ritual; risk in fantastical frequencies pays off in emotional truth. Irreplaceable premise inflects turns inevitably. Bold lyric closure heightens stakes.</comment>
