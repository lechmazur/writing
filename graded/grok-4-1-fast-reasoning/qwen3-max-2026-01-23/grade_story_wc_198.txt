<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to hush the prophecy roots in grandfather's teachings, embodied in muscle-memory playing and tears at closure; memories fuel present choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as notes and silences build density to Resonant Reconfiguration (vested hush unifies prism light); dewdrop fall seals legible conceptual cost without causal breaks; orientation anchors early in cabin fog ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism atrium in mist constrains playing (light coalesces into images, unifies at end), charging closure; sensory details (wet stone, jasmine, bioluminescent moss) weave through action, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early tightens via negative-space method and dewdrop timeframe, narrowing to final whisper; agency in pauses forces prophecy fraying with emotional cost in tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of intentional silence over dread emerges organically from notes/pauses dissolving coded prophecy; final rainbow reconfigures nostalgia into promise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature (misty, sonic hush) modulates rhythmically; purposeful lyric compression teaches pattern early, legible at charged poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but patterned repetition ("mist," "silence," "whisper") borders scaffold in peak playing beats without obscuring hush image; no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sax as mercy-weapon against prophecy via negative space; risk in lyric hush transforms prophecy trope, inevitable in dewdrop/rainbow closure.</comment>
