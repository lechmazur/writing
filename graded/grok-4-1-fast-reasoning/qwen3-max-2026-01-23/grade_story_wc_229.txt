<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots in grief-forged belief in vibrations, embodied in trembling fingers and chest hum, compelling the vial release with contradictory ache/hope. Silas's late entry applies crucible pressure, his tears and rasped admission earning relational reconfiguration. Final micro-choice to re-cork honors cost of vulnerability without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from heat's fray to scent's spiral, culminating in Charged Poise RR as Silas feels the garden, reweighting shout/whisper premise with his humbled gaze on horizon ("I was right"). Orientation anchors instantly in lighthouse/Atlantic/dawn. Closure cost legible in Silas's stripped bluster.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Breeze and railing constrain release, carrying scent as causal agent to Silas; cobalt tower charges final image, humming agreement as beam guides boat. Sensory hierarchy (salt vs. jasmine bloom) reflects Elias's priorities, mirroring internal shift without overt symbol. Dawn gold evolves with events, tactile in dew-knuckles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whispers > shouts) signaled early, tightens via scent's unexpected reach to Silas, narrowing options from solitary test to shared bridge. Agency in reverent uncorking forecloses doubt-path with relational/emotional cost. Accumulative cadence shift forces Silas's stance crystallization, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of purified whispers emerges via vial-scent events, reweighted in final boat image as gentle beam echoes vibration without moral state. Subtext in Silas's raw rasp carries implication over declaration; ambiguity lingers in Elara's unseen receipt. Resonance from particulars avoids platitude, internal arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with biased perceptual signature (scent/vibration focus); voice modulates rhythmically from introspective slowness to blooming release. Dialogue distinct—Elias silent, Silas rasped/subtext-laden—advances via awe without exposition. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short creak amid long blooms); purposeful "whisper" recurrence teaches pattern without loop. Minor scaffold in repetitive "vibration" phrasing near release (−0.3), but no muddle in peak uncorking/sigh. Propulsion clear, specific verbs (eased, bloomed, rasped) over modifiers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-as-vibration to beckon/prove whisper power transforms lighthouse trope via garden essence and cork purification. Risk in non-causal Accumulative closure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Silas's garden vision. No derivative templates; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
