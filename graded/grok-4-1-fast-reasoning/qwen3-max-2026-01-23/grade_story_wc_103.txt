<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in Aris's loss and intensifies through ritual choices, with embodied grief ("sob escaped") transforming into awe. Interiority particular via hedge-trailing and photo-tracing. Minor flaw: reflective backstory slightly summaries conflict before climax, but anchors tilt present actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from paths to nexus ritual, culminating in CR (memory burst reconfigures time perception) with cost (fragment surrender, grief release). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (dew-kissed paths, willow rustle) filters through Elara's reverence; hyperbolic maze constrains ritual choice at nexus. Final bark-touch charges closure image with decades' texture. No white-room; purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock time's texture) signaled early, tightens via disintegration unspooling under textural lens, forcing surrender with emotional cost legible in "sob escaped, but... awe replacing sorrow." Agency in incantation positions payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as forgiving texture emerges organically from hyperbolic release and photo stabilization, resonant in final bridge-crossing. Subtext in garden's conscious whispers avoids direct statement until earned. Slight explicitness in "time’s texture was forgiveness" borders echo but ties particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias (reverent hedge-whispers) distinct; rhythm modulates from mist-curl to spiral-release intensity. No dialogue or head-hopping; diction purposeful for fantasy texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short incantation lines to spiraling description). Minor figurative density in climax ("luminous threads... geodesics") risks overwrite but coheres without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious hyperbolic geometry fused with living maze and halo ritual transforms grief trope into fresh time-texture premise. Risky non-Euclidean payoff feels inevitable from early notes. No derivatives; singular vision.</comment>
