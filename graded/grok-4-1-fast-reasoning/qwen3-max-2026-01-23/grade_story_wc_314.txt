<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in frustration-throat tightening and soul-whisper recoil; final wire-bending choice earned by prior causality with tears as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to starlings revelation; RR closure lands on-page as "crystal did not shatter; it softened" with legible risk/fracture cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall's "kaleidoscopic veil" and ancient trees constrain observation/charge final shadows echoing starlings, mirroring internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake signaled in crystal dilemma tightens via starlings agency to pattern-guided flame; cost unmistakable in "fragile breath before...irreversible fracture" resolved without shatter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resonant non-literal answer in final "invited them to dance" reweights logic/intuition premise via crystal pulse without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical light/images; rhythmic control peaks in starlings' "spirals, vortices, and waves."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density with propulsion; coherent metaphors like "undulating river of light" enhance peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of flock patterns channeling flame transforms alchemical trope organically, risking intuition over logic with inevitable-feeling payoff.</comment>
