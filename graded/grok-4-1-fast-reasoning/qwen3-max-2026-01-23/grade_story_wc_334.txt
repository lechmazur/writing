<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in chronic curiosity versus avoidance habit compels the alignment study and mushroom release; embodied tears and lighter spirit show contradictory release without therapy-speak. Interiority concrete via tangible evidence trust and micro-choice to kneel/sketch. Minor unearned summary in "pure and personal" slightly dulls peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival/sketching to alignment/hum/shimmer/memory return as RR/CR with legible emotional cost in tears/release. Orientation anchored early in boots/mud/greenhouse/shipwrecks. Single scene causality intact; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain method (tidal reflections) and charge final image (guardians of love); sensory details (salt spray, cold trousers, wind-whispers) selective via folklorist bias. Micro-setting (fairy ring, pool) guides choices purposefully. Environment evolves with tide/moon to enable alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sketching/alignment to memory reconfiguration; agency in prescribed method forecloses avoidance with release cost. One deepening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal need. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration before tidal test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories/curiosity's triumph emerges organically from alignment sacrifice recall and mushroom release; final image reweights premise (broken stars/mushrooms/love) without moralizing. Resonance in "decay was not loss, but testament." Subtext in shattered sky mirroring rift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with folklorist perceptual signature (tangible evidence, coded language in stars); rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical closure. No dialogue. Purposeful compression in memory block anchors to shimmer cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels to alignment; metaphors purposeful (leviathan skeleton, fractured Orion) without muddle in peak. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite, but pattern-taught. No loops; ignores bracketed counts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklorist decoding shipwreck-constellations for memory rift; risk-taking in celestial fairy-ring alignment transforms tropes inevitably. Final reweighting (shipwrecks as guardians) feels earned/original.</comment>
