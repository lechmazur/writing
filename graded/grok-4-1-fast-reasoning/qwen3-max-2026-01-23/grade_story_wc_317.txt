<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation to safeguard innovation drives planting and revival of "Patient Bloom," earned through prior investor rejection; receptive trait shown concretely in seed response without alarm. Interiority particular but lacks embodied contradiction in high moments like planting (163).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via insight density building to CR closure at shoot emergence (238), reweighting dormant potential with time cost legible in patient visits; orientation anchored early, single scene with time elision coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Nocturnal haven and brook constrain planting site and charge final image as persistent current mirroring creativity; sensory details (crickets, moss) selective through receptive POV, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stake of patient innovation signaled early, tightens accumulatively via seed-idea linkage narrowing to revival choice; internal pressure coherent but off-page investors mute visceral cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Seed motif shifts from curiosity to validation, offering non-literal answer to haste-vs-patience via shoot (238); resonance emerges organically without moralizing until near-end hush summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with receptive perceptual signature in symbol-noticing; voice modulates rhythmically but elevated diction occasionally drifts from embodied simplicity in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Patterned repetition of "patient," "hush," "quiet," and brook flow creates loops dulling propulsion across reflections; figurative density purposeful but borders muddle in insight blocks (106-141).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Corpse flower transforms dormancy trope into escape-room innovation metaphor via orthogonal seed linkage; fresh synthesis of mystery mail and slow-bloom premise commits fully without hedging.</comment>
