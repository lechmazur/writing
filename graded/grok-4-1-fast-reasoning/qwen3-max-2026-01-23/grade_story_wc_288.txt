<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between isolation's chill and purpose's ignition act vividly in the ritual scene; final guardianship choice earned by memory's emotional truth and tears of release. Interiority concrete via knuckles whitening and bone-deep hum. No safety-hedging; flaws like solitary burden drive micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from memory surface to ritual deepening, landing Charged Poise closure in folio-writing image with felt cost of transforming burden to stewardship. Orientation anchored early in terrace/72 hours. Single shard fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sundial and stone circle constrain ritual choice and charge final reflection-clearing image. Sensory hierarchy (mist kiss, resonant hum in teeth/bone) reflects POV urgency; cloud tide evolves causally, pressuring timing. POV bias filters details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coexist with memories) signaled early, tightens via ritual's hum convergence reweighting knowledge under Accumulative lens. Agency in aligning sundial forces trade-off (doubt shatters fragility); cost legible in tears/release foreclosing isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: isolation space roots independence in stone circle's hum-promise. Final folio image offers non-literal answer to coexistence question, reweighting Whale departure without moralizing. Resonance from memory's fragile truth vs. purposeful testimony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sky-biased noticing (cloud currents, whale song overhead); rhythmic control modulates from wind-scoured tension to approving whisper. Stable single POV; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "brittle awakening that deposited..."); rhythm varies for propulsion, zero loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (salt in water dissolve) without muddle in peak ritual beat. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to resolved face image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation fantasy with Sky Whales' conscious migration and stone anchors; risk-taking in atomically reflective sundial transforms trope organically. Non-obvious angle on extinction as deliberate departure heightens stakes inevitably. Bold lyric texture coheres without gimmick.</comment>
