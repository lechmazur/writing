<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sacred duty to Kaelen drives all choices with embodied emotion ("polished ache of vindication"); interiority concrete via memory cues tilting present actions. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene keeps it from 9+; Valerius' shift adds relational crucible without diluting Elara's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: covering mirrors → shard glow → truth reveal → projection tightens options, lands CR closure in projection scene with legible cost ("too late for its prophet"). Orientation anchored early; single scene with one deepening turn fits defaults perfectly. No ambiguity, constraint (mirrors/storm) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and chroniton streams vivid/selective, mirrors constrain choices (covered to enable reveal) and charge final pedestal image. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's priorities (gilded cherubs, time eddies); spatial choreography coherent. Environment mirrors internal states subtly through action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vindicate Aethel via shard) signaled early, causal escalation via storm/method tightens to proof with agency (devises projection); cost felt in late vindication. One meaningful reversal (distorted → pure time-filaments) narrows options under causal lens. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate reimagining emerges organically from ritual reveal, resonant CR final image ("Aethel’s whispered verses into the endless dark") reweights violent assumptions without moralizing. Subtext in velvet projection implies truth's fragility; earned via particulars, invites reflection on misinterpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (poetic bias toward "flowing calligraphy"); voice rhythmic/modulates with pressure (whispered warning → steady voice). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("witness in time’s own light"); no head-hopping, diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm, but overwriting in metaphors ("burnished sorrow," weeping angels reprise) risks muddle in reveal beat without payoff. Minor paraphrase loops (sorrow/tears variants); clean grammar, no scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal archaeology, mirror-storm mechanics, poetic ritual transforms tropes; risk-taking in visible time/velvet projection heightens stakes organically. Final CR feels inevitable from particulars; bold sci-fi lyricism without gimmickry.</comment>
