<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in compassion drives Kael's micro-choices, like pressing the ampoule, with embodied emotion in "mineral tears traced paths"; earned change in his "granite veins" softens certainty at close. Interior contradiction between stone permanence and felt currents acts on-page without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations build density to Charged Poise closure; ampoule dissolution triggers cascade with legible cost in garden's renewal and Kael's shift. Orientation anchored early in underwater garden post-revelation; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting's Heartstone fracture constrains pivotal choice and charges final image of breathing garden; sensory details like "bioluminescent kelp" and "silt settled in mandalas" integrate purposefully through Kael's actions. Specificity mirrors internal nuance without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of introducing nuance escalates via revelation density under Accumulative lens, narrowing from agitation to resolve; agency in threading telepathy forecloses rigid certainty with cost in Kael's softening. One tightening suffices, coherent pressure to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of nuance vs. certainty emerges organically from revelations and final garden animation without moralizing; resonant CR reweights premise in "certainty learns to bend." Particulars like foxglove duality avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in telepathic projections and stone-embodied noticing; poetic rhythm modulates tenderly at revelations. Voice distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language in every revelation beat (e.g., "golden thread stitching history’s tears") overwrites without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion; paraphrase loops on "incisively kind" and "nuance" across final third add −0.8 artifacts, touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue and foxglove catalyst transforms tropes into organic renewal arc; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
