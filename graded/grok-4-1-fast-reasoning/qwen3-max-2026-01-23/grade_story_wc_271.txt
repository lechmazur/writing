<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation in freeze-to-grounding sequence, with contradictory sorrow/optimism impulses acting simultaneously; final endurance of loss via pearl earns closure. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("somatic markers") borders therapy abstraction but stays anchored in actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density build to Charged Poise closure in final non-flinch at laughter and orchid watering; orientation anchors immediately in arboretum path. Cost legible in "photograph rested... realistic weight, but heart balanced," reconfiguring trauma's rule-set.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "sea thrift blooming defiantly in granite cracks" and cypress bark constrain grounding choices and charge final images. Lighthouse reframe mirrors resilience without overt symbolism; sensory hierarchy (mist, pine, waves) reflects botanical POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrate loss/optimism) signaled early, tightens accumulatively from gull-triggered freeze to earned non-flinch; agency in somatic choices forecloses panic path. Visible cost in trembling hands and reframed sorrow reweights options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of realism-anchored optimism emerges organically from particulars like thrift in cracks and lighthouse evolution; final orchid droplets offer non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in photo's shift from trigger to testament avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with botanical perceptual signature (leaf veins, thrift curves) stable in single close-third POV; rhythm modulates from freeze tension to poised cadence. Purposeful compression teaches pattern early, pays off in closure poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric repetition (pearl, realism/optimism), but paraphrase loops on concepts ("realism also demanded," "realistically anchored optimism") create mild churn across middle beats. Rhythm varies read-aloud, no closure dulling; minor template stems in reflections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via botanical/somatic metaphors (orchid roots, thrift in cracks) transforms tropes; lighthouse reframe and pearl concept offer non-obvious angle. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
