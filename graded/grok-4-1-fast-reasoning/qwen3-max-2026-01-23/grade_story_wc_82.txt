<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied grief and contradictory impulses in the paradoxical ascent/descent during recording, earning the fragile peace at closure; interiority particular via tear-dampened polishing and hollow heart. Micro-choices like precise folds reveal values under pressure. Final crane placement shows earned renunciation of raw torment with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: polishing to recording to folding builds density toward Charged Poise closure in the tear and next sheet selection, reweighting grief with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via dream-realm paradox suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating island tea garden and glass basilica constrain craft (basilica threshold softens world for descent) and charge final image (island's ascent mirrors internal shift). Sensory details selective via POV grief (silver-leafed bushes, fractured rainbows). Recurrent lanterns/cranes evolve with action, mirroring torment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through recording's refinement into coherent thread, narrowing to bearable form with descent cost legible in "visceral recollection." Agency in chant and folds forecloses raw chaos. Final endurance crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of descent-to-ascent via craft emerges organically from particulars like gem-flare and crane folds, culminating in resonant final image of tear as acknowledgment without moralizing. Subtext in shadow's "light it once provided" reweights loss. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in ongoing craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (luminous voids, humming paper) biased by grief; rhythmic prose modulates from polished circular motions to compacted folds. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful and taught early. Voice reflects crafty precision under torment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each crease was a conscious act of containment"); rhythm varies for propulsion, syntax purposeful in peak recording beat. Minor figurative density in dream nebula without muddle or loop; no scaffolds, but slight ascent/descent repetition taught as pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-loss fantasy, dream gems, and origami grief-transmutation feels inevitable; risk in luminous paradox heightens stakes without gimmick. Premise transformed via craft logic—no template echoes. Final crane recharges all prior images organically.</comment>
