<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between professional ethics and humanity peak in the ethical recoil over wasting truth, earning the subsumption choice with embodied tears as visible cost; interiority particular via static sensing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Resonant Reconfiguration (Kael remade as empathetic bridge); closure charged by final lightness and static hum with emotional cost legible in raw exposure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber grotto at dusk constrains sensing ritual and parallels internal transformation, charging final starlit exit image; selective sensory details (resin glow, moss hollows) filter through Kael's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of flawless calibration tightens via half-truth discovery narrowing sell/discard options; agency in subsumption forecloses detachment with on-page grief cost, though external pressure light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of half-truth integrity emerges organically via petal's accidental grief; final "half truth had become his whole truth" offers resonant non-literal reweighting of prior counterfeits without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in static translations (rain echoes, buzz patterns); rhythmic modulation heightens sensory immersion without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful static motif propulsion; minor overwrite in repetitive transformation echoes ("shift from day to night") slightly dulls peak but pattern-taught and closure clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of static-sensing emotion dealer transforms counterfeit trope via half-truth dilemma; risk-taking in lyric accumulative texture heightens stakes organically to empathetic bridge closure.</comment>
