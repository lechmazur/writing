<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via arrow tip's guidance to mission shift; interiority embodied through sensations like arrow warmth and phantom memories. Final renunciation of harvest earned by twig test, foreclosing extraction path with conceptual cost. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: impressions density builds to source discovery as CR, reweighting premise from extraction to protection. Orientation anchored early in inversion hour. Closure cost legible in "no trophy, only certainty" and shifted mission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward water streams constrain navigation and charge climax at Cradle Arch pool. Sensory details (visual ribbons, spiraling leaves) filtered through Kael's reverent priorities, evolving with inversion's end. Micro-setting (skiff, twig) enables key tests.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find resilience source) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via echoes and accelerated growth to stance crystallization. Agency in following flows and twig dip forecloses harvest option. Cost felt in reverence over control, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via remembrance emerges organically from echoes and source test, resonant in "true resilience flows...from listening." Final image reweights prior journey without moralizing. Particulars like arrow tip reprise avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of sensory/memory bias; voice modulates rhythmically from lurching motion to whirling silence. Compression purposeful and taught early, legible at CR closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; rhythm varies (short silence beats amid flowing sentences). Figurative language coherent and pattern-taught (water veins, stone tears), no loops or muddle in peak twig test. Minor density risks overwriting but supports lyric drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inverted-gravity orchard with memory-echoes synthesizes fresh ecological premise; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via sensory immersion. Transformation of tropes (compass artifact as reminder) feels inevitable in protective closure.</comment>
