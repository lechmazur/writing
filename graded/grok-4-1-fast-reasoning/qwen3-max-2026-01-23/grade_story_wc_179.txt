<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's scheming pacifism drives precise guidance, earning Kael's cellular shift with embodied resistance-then-release; internal conflict vivid in "Resistance tightened his jaw" before memory flood. Minor therapy-speak in "corrosive grip" slightly abstracts peak emotion without full embodiment penalty. Final choice forecloses resentment path with felt tear and acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from triggers to RR/Charged Poise closure: pin reappearance and "The music was never in the pin" reweights stake with emotional cost legible in dissolving mist image. Single scene anchored early ("pearlescent walls"); no orientation debt. Lens holds cleanly to ending reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sanctuary's silence consumes sound, constraining verbal evasion for memory pressure; music box pin as micro-setting handled tactilely ("feel the wood") charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (pressure of presence, lavender ghost) POV-filtered via Kael's body. Reality shifts evolve causally, mirroring internal softening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resentment release) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cellular deepening that narrows bitterness options; Elara's guidance forces Kael's endurance-then-shift with tear cost. One decisive cadence reweights under lens without needing causal turns. Agency in micro-choices like trembling palms alters tactics visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of release as strength emerges organically from pin's evolution and cellular flood, culminating in non-literal "resilient rhythm of his released heart" that recharges prior fracture without moral state. Returning grace image shifts meaning, embracing imperfection complexity. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical single POV stable, perceptual signature in somatic bias ("palms vibrated with ghost"); rhythmic modulation builds to peak compression in memory cascade. Sparse thoughts natural/subtextual, advancing via implication. No head-hopping; voice texture purposeful for Accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tiny fracture echoing the裂痕 in his soul" advances object/character); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor figurative density in opening ("pocket of absolute stillness woven") risks overwrite but coherent and pattern-taught. Clean mechanics, vivid specificity over generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh somatic healing via engineered cellular grace in shifting-reality frame transforms therapy trope into tangible pin reprise; risk in silence/soundlessness heightens stakes without gimmick. Non-obvious synthesis of pacifist schemes and physics-like grace feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
