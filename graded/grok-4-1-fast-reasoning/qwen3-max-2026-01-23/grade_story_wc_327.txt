<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve the Old Tongue drives consistent micro-choices like matching diamond ridges to bird Vs and her precise utterances, earning the vow's fulfillment. Interiority feels embodied in tactile focus and warming stone, with competence balanced by the latent curse's dormancy. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously, but actions reveal hierarchy of values without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observation to layered echoes culminating in RR (diamond flares, language reborn) with legible cost in "weight of centuries lift." Orientation anchors early via Elara, diamond, bone-tower canyon. Single scene coheres; pattern of texture-bird-sound matching tightens without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone towers and echo tunnel constrain choices—sounds coil permanently, fossil spines guide climb—charging final image of towers as "instruments, forever tuned." Sensory hierarchy tactile/auditory via POV bias; details evolve causally (diamond warms, canyon breathes word). Micro-setting (diamond, copper-veins) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate texture to sound before language dies) signaled early; tightening via pattern intensification (click→hum→consonants→word) reweights dormancy to activation under Accumulative lens. Agency in utterances forecloses silence with felt cost (breath gathered, work done). No reversal beyond micro-turns, but pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of texture-to-sound rebirth emerges organically from diamond-bird-echoes, culminating in resonant CR: "texture was sound, the silence was broken." Final image (canyon breathing word) reweights death/rebirth without moralizing; ambiguity in curse as "lock" adds complexity. No token motifs; particulars drive earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: tactile ("copper-veined fingertips"), auditory bias under Elara's lexicon. Rhythmic control modulates—short crisp clicks mirror V-dive, swelling hum arcs; purposeful lyric compression taught early via sky-dancer glyphs. No head-hopping; diction coherent, stress-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/propulsion (e.g., "sharp ridge... V... crisp click" advances three jobs). Rhythm varies read-aloud; minor metaphor density in peak ("constellation of meaning") purposeful without muddle. Template cadence absent; ignores bracket artifacts; slight synonym churn in "echoes" purposeful for lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bird glyphs mirror diamond flaws for tactile-to-auditory translation in bone-echo world feels inevitable, transforming curse trope via vow. Risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes; no derivatives, bold irreplaceability in copper-veins enabling precise feel.</comment>
