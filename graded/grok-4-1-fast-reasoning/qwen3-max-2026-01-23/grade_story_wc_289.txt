<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as keeper seeking connection, driving weave from twig find to personal secret placement. Interiority concrete via embodied solitude dissolving into "heart swelling," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal building beat. Final change earned through accumulative actions without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: twig discovery accumulates into installation buildup and visitor interactions tightening to CR closure when Elara places "home," reconfiguring solitude with felt belonging cost. Single scene oriented early via pond path and temple; no shards or ambiguity. One meaningful deepening via strangers' offerings dissolving isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pond and temple supply materials constraining weave choices and evolve to charge final dawn image of converging threads. Sensory details (wet stone, lotus prisms) selective via Elara's perceptual bias, mirroring internal untethering. Micro-setting (twig, stones) anchors action without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding connection signaled early, escalates accumulatively via installation growth and visitor resonance forcing Elara's vulnerable addition. Agency in weaving narrows isolation options; cost legible in "solitude replaced by quiet kinship." One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of rejoin emerges from particulars like thrush spiral to shared secrets web, final image resonating without moralizing as Elara's "home" reweights premise. Subtext in silent acknowledgments avoids sentimentality; complexity in organic belonging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of prismatic connections; rhythmic lyricism modulates from quiet observation to charged kinship. No dialogue to judge; elision of visitor interiors purposeful and legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor overwriting in descriptive runs like opening "prismatic quiet" cascades risks figurative muddle without peak pressure payoff. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies purposefully. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter's secrets into living spiral installation transforms whimsical twig into profound web. Risk in public vulnerability heightens stakes organically; no template echoes.</comment>
