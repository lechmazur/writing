<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her quest, embodied concretely through quantifying absence before incising the stone. Interiority shines in pinpointing the "coordinate—two-thirds down, left of center," revealing character-specific reverence. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; resolution feels competent but untroubled by visible internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lull's "dense and demanding" absence to incision's "white line emerged," culminating in CR closure—"the genesis was the gesture itself"—with legible conceptual cost in sealed covenant. Orientation anchors early via shop in glass orchard library. No slips touch closure image of light flooding and customer arriving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "crystalline walls," "chiming" branches, and "liquid shadows" from bottled moonlight filter through Elara's priorities, constraining her method via slates' textures. Recurring shop elements charge final image as "every slate gleam[s] with reflected promise." Environment subtly guides via proximity to library illuminating "fragile spark."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding stories' origin—tightens accumulatively as lull's "absence pressed against her skin," forcing incision agency that forecloses doubt with parole's fulfillment cost. Escalation coheres via deepening realization, but lacks a sharper trade-off beyond resolve, entering 8-band firmly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of creation's void emerges organically from quantified absence to "intersection of will and void," reweighting premise in final CR without moralizing. Returning images like moonlight's eruption resonate non-literally, inviting ambiguity on belief's contingency. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "cool, absolute void" and "temperature shift," biasing toward inception's seeds. Lyrical syntax modulates rhythmically from descriptive poise to incision's "whisper-scrape." No head-hopping; voice coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally—"tip touched stone with a whisper-scrape, like a leaf detaching"—propelling from setup to climax without loops or scaffolds. Dense lines multitask, integrating setting into action; minor figurative density in opening fits accumulative pattern without muddling peak incision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tabula rasa philosophy in floating library with "quantifying absence" method feels inevitable, transforming tropes via specific incision turning void fertile. Risky lyrical fragmentation heightens stakes of first mark without gimmickry, charging closure uniquely.</comment>
