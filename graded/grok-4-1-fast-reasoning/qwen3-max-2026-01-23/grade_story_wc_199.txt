<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied "mossy delight" and micro-choices like prodding the leaf's vein; final spirit transformation earned through prior ritual causality. Minimal contradictory impulses limit 9+; competence dominates without deep flaws complicating peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine sorting to leaf's speck integration, yielding Charged Poise closure as light fades and message resonates ("remembrance plants seeds"). Orientation anchored early; cost legible in emotional cascade to grandmother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ashen arbor and moss constrain monument-building, charging final image of widened bark patterns; sensory details (cool textured leaf, silvery glow) filter through Elara's priorities. Recurrent leaves guide choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode leaves for ancestral connection) signaled early, tightens via speck discovery forcing reverent integration; agency in alcove creation forecloses oblivion with felt emotional cost. Accumulative deepening suffices, but lacks micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges organically from monument rituals and leaf message, resonant non-literal answer in "future child would rediscover these tales." Final image reweights particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("quiet fire warming her spirit," biased noticing of overlooked beauty); rhythmic modulation builds to hush's potency. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration; purposeful lyric metaphors cohere without muddle. Minor "mossy delight" repetition patterns motif but borders loop in late beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore arbor and micro-monuments transforms mythic tropes into poignant lyric custody; risk-taking in accumulative hush heightens stakes to charged closure image.</comment>
