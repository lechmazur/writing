<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode Albright's intention is clear and intensifies through embodied ache and smile, with micro-choices like needle separation revealing values; traits like blithe spirit shown via joy amid sorrow. Minor label-speak ("tenderly organized") slightly abstracts interiority but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echo density builds to spiral pattern (RR/CR) with poignant ache as felt cost in "final cobalt thread came free with a sigh"; orientation anchored early (Elara steps inside silo). Single scene, no shards, closure reconfigures mystery into lesson with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (scent of rain, voice echoes) selective via gardener's priorities; sovereign case/tools constrain decoding choices, charging final spiral image. Cobalt silo/velveteen gloom mirrors internal shift from gloom to cradle, evolved causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover intention shape) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via thread decodings narrowing bewilderment to truth; agency in untangling forecloses confusion with ache cost legible at "poignant ache." One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mentorship/growth emerges organically from echoes to spiral (gold/grey/crimson), resonant in forget-me-nots and stars without moralizing; final image reweights premise non-literally. Quoted echoes verge on thematic echo but arise from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (gardening metaphors like roots/yew trees); rhythmic prose modulates calmly to charged poise at closure, diction purposeful and biased. No dialogue; elisions taught via method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density (velveteen gloom, frayed threads) borders overwriting in opening without mid-beat restraint; minor echo repetition ("uncharted echoes") lacks churn but dulls slightly. Propulsion clear, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess mystery via thread-echoes and gardener's decoding transforms introspection trope; spiral pattern from particulars feels inevitable, voice risks poetic elevation coherently. No derivative echoes.</comment>
