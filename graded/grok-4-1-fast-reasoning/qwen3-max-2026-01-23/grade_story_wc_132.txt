<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in hands tightening amid recognition of surrender (line ~57); micro-choices like returning the leaf earn the final shift. Flawless single-POV execution balances competence with blind spots in control obsession. Mrs. Higgins' brief pressure tests the arc cleanly without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to Charged Poise closure in palm-on-trellis image (line 257), reweighting control premise with felt release cost; one time-jump shard ("Days later") taught early and legible. Orientation anchors by para 1. No causality breaks; leaf return forecloses repair path on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and linden leaf constrain choices and charge final image (returning leaf, palm placement); sensory details (mist curling, boots sinking) selectively POV-biased toward plant study. Micro-setting (soil-warmed violets) evolves causally, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. nature's flow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via oak memory and leaf epiphany that narrows options; agency in non-repair renunciation forecloses dominance path with emotional cost legible in tear/release (line 119). No reversals needed; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis emerges organically from plant parallels, resonating in willow arc and final linden rustle without moralizing; final image reweights resistance-to-flow question non-literally. Mrs. Higgins dialogue borders explicit ("releasing control," line 219), slightly undermining subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (circuitously sincere via nature metaphors) stable, modulating rhythm with intensity; dialogue sparse but subtextual and voice-distinct (Elara's warm indirection vs. Higgins' fret). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in image-propelled lines (e.g., moss "collaboration," line 97); minimal loops despite "releasing control" echoes. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (velvet moss, gold-tinged edges) risks coherence in opening but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nursery epiphany through embodied plant/human parallels transforms control trope; willow curve and moss collaboration inflections grow from particulars. Bold lyric risk in time-shard accrual heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
