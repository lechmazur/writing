<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in machinist traits compel vent placement; embodied tremble reveals contradiction under pressure. Secondary characters Elara/Borin apply closing approval without diluting Kael's arc. Minor epiphanic summary in final lines prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decoding adhesive (104) → chain marking (146) → vents open (176) as Decisive Change with tremble cost legible in closure beat. Single scene anchors orientation early; no shards or ambiguity. Persistent chain constraint shapes tactics to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breathing stone and flex points constrain vent choices; dappled sunlight recurs to charge final harmonizing image. Sensory hierarchy (tactile stone, steam hiss) filters via machinist POV. Micro-setting of envelope/adhesive enables decoding pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant harmonization stake signaled early tightens via decoding reversal (116), narrowing options to reverent placement amid tremor peak. Causal agency drives vents' success; tremble and untouched carvings show felt cost charging closure. One decisive escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion emerges organically from adhesive decode to bridge-building closure image, reweighting conflict without moralizing. Final chain/breathing reprise answers listening theme non-literally. Ambiguity in guild hearts' harmony invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual machinist bias (fracture tracing, adhesive analysis); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet certainty to peak intensity. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing voices. Minor elevated diction fits lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; varied syntax propels from setup to vents' hiss. Minor figurative density ("mechanical sonnet" at 160) risks coherence but pattern-taught; no loops touch closure. Ignore word-count artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh adhesive-decoding cipher transforms engineer trope into time-spanning harmony; volcano-breathing setting synthesizes ingenuity organically. Risky poetic compression heightens breathing motif without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
