<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "claustrophobia screamed... but a wistful rebellion stirred," compelling the organ climb and play with village stake; final endurance of shadow feels earned via prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as spatial chaos density builds to organ resonance RR (Charged Poise), reconfiguring nexus with cost in endured fear; cost legible in "shadow" persisting post-key grasp.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Organ loft constrains climax choice amid tightening walls; starlight evolves from sliver to "silver rivers," charging final benediction image through POV-filtered urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightens via walls pressing options, agency in scale-playing forces claustrophobia trade-off; cost unmistakable in tears and "shadow" amid harmonized nexus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rebellion-through-listening emerges implicitly from melody quelling mutiny; final "rebellion could be a resonant chord" reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "geometry itself had rebelled"; rhythmic modulation peaks in "reverberation... unfolded like liquid light" under awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor figurative pile-up ("liquid light, silver rivers") in climax slightly muddles without obscuring; no loops, rhythm reads aloud smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny quelled by organ resonance transforms explorer trope via heartwood key; fresh synthesis inevitable in "dialogue across centuries," risking lyric closure payoff.</comment>
