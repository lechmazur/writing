<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's interiority embodied in pacing the lantern room and breath catching at Elara's arrival reveals contradictory regret and hope; final apology earns change through prior causality. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "vulnerability—the true method" slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in "I am sorry" apology and stone exchange, reconfiguring isolation to duet with felt relational cost; orientation anchored by ~50 words in lighthouse setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse and rocky island constrain solitude-driven choices and charge final image framing "hope" and open door; sensory details like tide’s whisper and rose-gold light evolve purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciliation signaled early tightens accumulatively via Elara's pre-microdot arrival, forcing vulnerability trade-off; cost legible in "tears blurred his vision" as words alone suffice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically from cookie dual layers to plainspoken apology, resonant in stone reprise without moralizing; final image reweights hidden vs. visible truths non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in maritime-tinged diction like "granite teeth" and "eastern current"; dialogue subtextual in Elara's "I read it" carrying ritual echo advances closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but repetitive phrasing ("accidentally prophetic," "open secrets") creates minor paraphrase loops across reflective beats, dulling propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookies with microdots as estranged reconciliation ploy transforms spycraft trope via prophetic irony; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens emotional specificity.</comment>
