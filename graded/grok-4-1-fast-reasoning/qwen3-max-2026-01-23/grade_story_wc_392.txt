<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's watchful calm enables empirical cataloging amid empathetic memories at the lantern contact, earning her final resolve; minor diagnostic labels like "fortified vulnerability" slightly abstract interiority without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from stones to lantern memories to evidence bag, delivering Charged Poise closure ("profound shift... emotional drought was ending too") with legible personal cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel's flooding streams, slick algae, and absent barriers constrain investigation choices and mirror emotional thawing; lantern as recurring micro-setting charges final image ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose society) signaled early, escalates via memory-deepening that narrows accident narrative; protagonist agency in documentation forecloses negligence denial with felt personal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of true guidance (lantern's authentic history vs. perverted control) emerges organically from particulars, reweighted in closing promise without moralizing; minor overtness in "compassionate remembrance."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature filters sensory details empirically (e.g., "scuff marks indicating a struggle"); rhythmic modulation supports accumulative tension without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops on "controlling influence" and "watchful calm" repetitions dull density in reflective blocks; strong propulsion overall, but therapy-speak artifacts in peak epiphany ("fortified vulnerability") cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathetic artifact imprint colliding modern negligence probe transforms Underground Railroad trope; lantern's dual history inevitably charges closure without gimmickry.</comment>
