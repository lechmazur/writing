<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo's resilient positivity embodies motivation consistently, driving intuitive choices like humming the shanty to tune dials; internal conflict is subtle but present in steady heart amid unraveling. Lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats, but change to "deeper and wiser" smile feels earned with etched soul-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly density builds to grotto patterns, causal ellipsis via intuitive broadcast to hourglass turn yields Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "permanent transient etched permanently into his soul." Orientation anchored early; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Starlight patterns on grotto walls constrain tuning choice and charge mandala fusion image. Sensory hierarchy (hum through plates, flickering railing) reflects Leo's perceptual bias; evolves causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merge timelines) signaled early, escalates via radio echoes and sideways clock to intuitive resolve under accumulative lens. Agency in pouring will into radio forecloses fracture path; cost felt in collective selves' echoes and soul-etching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds/resolve emerges via patterns fusing to mandala, final image reconfigures "beauty in... quiet sighs" with non-literal "guardian of thresholds." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in hourglass' residual potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (cherishes commuters' sighs, starlit clarity); rhythmic modulation heightens dissolution to unity. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("liquid mercury," "burning ember") slightly muddles peak grotto beat without obscuring causality. No loops or scaffolds; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms vanishing ferry trope via intuitive patterns/hourglass merge, risking lyric accumulative structure that heightens cosmic stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early anomaly to "bridge between worlds"; no hedging.</comment>
