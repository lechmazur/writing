<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's gently meticulous traits root her motivation and actions consistently, shown through precise sampling and reverent archiving. Interiority feels embodied in chilled-yet-warm hands, honoring the fade without mourning. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ depth, but endurance earns closure without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sampling frequencies to slide's flicker and vanish ("Then, silence"), yielding Charged Poise closure in archiving and covenant vow. Orientation anchored early ("frozen library... Elara, the orderly records chief"). Cost legible in "ephemeral light into permanent truth," foreclosing illusion for data.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "quartz hush" and "frost-rimed aisles" integrate into action, with workbench tools constraining measurement. Library's ice encases stakes, mirroring preservation; final shelves "stretch endlessly into the frozen gloom," charging closure image. POV bias filters professionally (frequencies over spectacle).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage vow from oblivion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through dwindling amplitudes to ultraviolet pulse holding at 0.4, then violent flicker. Agency in precise sampling forecloses spectacle, paying cost of fade for data endurance. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forging meaning against oblivion emerges organically from sampling decay into "mathematical elegy," reweighted in final "light into legacy." No moralizing; resonant image of endless shelves and "quartz hush deepened" answers via particulars. Complexity in refusing spectacle for data.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: reverent precision in "fingers tracing... with reverent care." Voice texture modulates rhythmically, diction like "quartz hush" character-specific. Experimental repetition taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring process (whispering gears to flickering glimpse). Minor paraphrase loops in preservation motifs ("salvage... honored... safe"), but purposeful under accumulative lens. No scaffold obscures closure; ignore embedded counts as artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magic slides as frequency data in ice library transforms preservation trope via specific science-fantasy logic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hindsight in "one precise frequency, one saved memory."</comment>
