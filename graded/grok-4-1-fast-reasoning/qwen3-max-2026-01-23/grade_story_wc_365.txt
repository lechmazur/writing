<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in volatile weave threatening oblivion, compelling shift to compassion that earns closure integration; interiority embodied in sensory catalogs and shard warmth. Final renunciation of accusation reveals flaw-balanced competence with humbling cost fully legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory visions densify dissonance toward pattern break; CR closure crystallizes in Kael's vision with conceptual cost ("immense, humbling, and fiercely purposeful") reweighting sacrifice. Shard constraint shapes all tactics; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shard as micro-setting constrains breath-alignment and intent-pouring choices, recharging final pouch-tuck image; sensory hierarchy (rust, chill, hum) reflects map-maker bias and evolves from desolation to "topography of grace."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) deepens via volatile ejection threat, forcing agency in compassion-shift under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in harmonized stilling and soul-anchor realization, though single tightening limits to very strong band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of selfless sacrifice emerges organically from shard-visions and final "foundation upon which to build"; resonant non-literal answer reweights accusation-to-grace arc without moralizing, lingering in altered map image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sensory mapping ("cataloged the scent... map of absence"); rhythmic control modulates from storm-density to resonant silence, diction biased toward cosmic rhythms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in vision-shifts; purposeful lyrical metaphors ("skeletal ships drifted like forgotten prayers") pattern-taught early without muddle, though minor elevated repetition ("weight") nudges from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory-multiverse weaving transforms tropes via cyclic volatility and sacrifice-essence reveal; risk in mosaic shards heightens ingenuity without obscuring CR closure.</comment>
