<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots consistently in exile's ache, intensifying to compel gnomon-shaping; embodied tear and resonance earn change with cost. Interiority particular via root/bone perceptions under doubt. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract impulses pre-closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: density builds from excavation to sundial discovery to alignment RR, with tightening at gnomon install foreclosing doubt. Closure cost legible in "tear traced... veil thin to gossamer." Orientation anchored early in path/boots/orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains: moss aligns gnomon north, roots reframe as reunion shaping tactics; charges closure shadow on door. Sensory selective via POV (blossoms hum doubt's edges). No white-room; coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (faith restoration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via discoveries narrowing doubt to resolve. Agency in wandering/rebuilding forces trade-off; cost unmistakable in resonance hum post-alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: journeys mend via roots/shadows, final image reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity in faith as choice vs certainty. Minor abstract summary "interrupted journeys mended" pre-peak slightly tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical texture distinct: perceptual bias to enchantment (roots weave promises) modulates with intensity. Stable single POV, rhythm heightens poise at noon hush. No elision debt; purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels: varied syntax breathes with scene. Minor figurative density ("roots cradling bones like tender guardians") in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught pays at reunion reveal. Zero loops; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: catacomb orchard reframes death as continuum via sundial ritual, risk-taking lyricism heightens stakes. Transformation of returnee trope inevitable in shadow alignment.</comment>
