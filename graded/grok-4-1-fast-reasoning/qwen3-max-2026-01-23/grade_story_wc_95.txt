<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via mechanical arm's precision and welcoming chaos as variable; motivation "turn questions into destinations" drives micro-choices in alignment; minor slip in told epiphany "profound peace settle deep within her bones" slightly abstracts pivotal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with alignments building density to CR closure ("question of shadows had become a destination of light"); orientation anchored early; cost legible in vulnerability symbolized by "transparency symbolizing the vulnerability required for true dialogue."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sundial's half-painted face and brook constrain choices (shadow angles, rhythmic anchor); breeze complicates precision, charging final image; selective sensory hierarchy via mechanical gyroscope perfect for POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode overture) tightens via needle alignments under lens; agency in micron calibration forecloses ambiguity with felt cost (composure vs. shuddering shadow); single deepening sufficient, no reversal needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-order emerges via particulars (shadow fracture to unified); final image reconfigures "abstract question...into...collaborative unity" without moralizing; earned via struggle, resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mechanical/organic contrasts and selective noticing (luminous edges, solar trajectories); stable close third-person limited with rhythmic modulation; no dialogue, voice coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, varied syntax; figurative layering (light/shadow, symphony) taught early pays off at closure; minor density overload in alignment beat ("dignified chaos...coalesced into elegant order") borders overwrite but supports tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dueling philosopher, needle-sundial puzzle transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes; irreplaceable premise drives ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
