<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in reverence and study, compelling the peeling micro-choices under time pressure. Embodied emotions like sweat tracing temples and tears at reveal show particularity. Minor slip: idealized competence lacks contradictory impulses during climax peel, but doesn't touch closure turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers peel to build revelation, tightening to sunrise ray. On-page CR closure as Elara turns from staircase, speaking glyphs reconfigures throne with cost ("ruby flake dissolved," weight lifts like mist). Orientation anchored early at threshold; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent petals and silver-barked trees constrain path to monolith, filtering through lore-keeper bias (historical layers). Waterfall seals at dawn charges choices. Environment evolves causally with awakening, mirroring internal shift in final orchard bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stairway before dawn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via peeling urgency ("time tightened around her chest"). Agency in glyph-speaking forecloses throne path with flake dissolution cost. One deepening at reveal suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of restoration over rule emerges from peeling particulars, CR reweights throne in "not meant for sitting" realization without statement. Orchard awakening image resonates non-literally, charging prior layers. No moralizing; ambiguity in unclaimed design lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: notices paint as "chapters—beauty, pain, hope." Poetic diction/rhythm modulates urgency ("breath-held motion"). No head-hopping; voice texture distinct, purposeful compression in glyph-speaking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels: sentences multi-job (action + sensory + theme). Rhythmic variety in peak ("Sweat traced her temples as the eastern sky blushed rose-gold"). Minor figurative density in peeling beat but coherent, no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: paint-peeling as historical ascent transforms quest trope, throne twist grows from layers. Risky CR (descent via memory) inevitable in hindsight. Bold imagery like "liquid light shifting through hues of forgotten nebulae" particularizes voice.</comment>
