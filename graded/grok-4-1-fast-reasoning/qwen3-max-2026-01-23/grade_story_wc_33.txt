<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's letter compels micro-choices like storm use and drone deployment, earning the final purpose shift. Interiority concrete via embodied reverence and ledger-tracking, but some summary of traits dilutes contradiction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to drone send-off as Charged Poise closure; cost legible in patrol risk and recorked storm. Orientation anchors early ("cobalt arcade...disputed border"); single scene causality intact without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt tiles constrain via loose hiding spot for drone and pool light for drop; selective sensory (whispering boots, whirring hum) filters through Kael's reverence. Final shimmer recharges setting, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggle without detection) signaled early, tightens via patrol → storm reversal under accumulative lens, narrowing options. Cost felt in risked exposure, charging drone ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of healing via small connections emerges from ledger absences and flower/message acts, resonating in final "fragile electricity of possibility." Non-literal answer in satchel lightening reweights promises without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sacred hush, cartographer's precision); rhythmic modulation peaks at storm "violet lightning flashed, mist fell." No dialogue; voice lyrical yet legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("linking absences" restated thrice) and figurative density in opener slightly dull early propulsion; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman smuggling via reprogrammed drone and storm orb transforms border trope; risk of overload act heightens stakes organically.</comment>
