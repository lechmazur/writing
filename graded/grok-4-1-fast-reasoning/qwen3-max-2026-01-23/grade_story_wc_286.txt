<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Kael's zen-minded focus and potter's gentle touch on clay create embodied interiority and micro-choices that earn his purpose shift. Contradictory impulses in revering skeletal hives over sorrow act in the final bow. Closure choice motivated by vision of beekeeper's devotion.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from positioning to thrum/vision CR, reweighting oasis premise with kindness cost in carried purpose. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (oasis, Kael, twilight). No lens ambiguity; sun-ray closure image pays off pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sun-bleached stones and dry well constrain alignment choice; skeletal hives charge final image as "vessels holding compassion." Sensory hierarchy (ochre waves, thrum in bones) reflects potter's tactile bias. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (oasis resistance) signaled early; thrum deepens via layered timelines, narrowing to kindness anchor under accumulative lens. Agency in gentle handling forecloses ignorance with purpose cost. Visible price in heart "full not with answers, but deeper purpose."</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Kindness as temporal soil emerges organically via beekeeper's acts; final image reweights premise non-literally as "indelible marks on time." No moralizing; ambiguity in fragile future lingers with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature: clay-bell thrum, centering touch. Rhythmic prose modulates with vision intensity; no head-hopping. Diction reflects potter's idiom (glazed bowls honor resilience).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (dust settles around sandals); varied rhythm propels to thrum peak without loops. Minor figurative density ("air fractured") purposeful in lyric mode, no muddle at closure.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Phototropic kindness bending timelines synthesizes fresh premise; risk in vision layers heightens stakes via memory anchor. Transformation of tropes (wasteland sanctuary) feels inevitable in pottery change.</comment>
