<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in trembling hands betraying "haunted ambition" against "kindly methodical nature," compelling the planting micro-choice with embodied emotional cost; final acceptance earned via prior causality without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Conceptual Repricing at "Aris understood then," reconfiguring obsession into acceptance with legible emotional cost in tears and softened ambitions; orientation anchored crisply in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's "conductive branches" and "converged currents" constrain planting choice and charge final "glow softly around the planted seed," with sensory details (humming soil, misting breath) filtered through translator's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition) signaled early tightens via failed observation to analogical deepening, forcing renunciation of control with agency in deliberate planting; cost felt in "silent apology to Elara."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honoring connection emerges organically from seed planting and arbor integration, offering resonant non-literal answer in final shoot as "testament," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in analogical leaps (tablets to arbor); rhythmic control heightens quiet intensity without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked descriptors ("profound quiet settled... weight of another failed") slightly dulls peak density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform physics and magnetic arbor transforms grief trope into inevitable seed-planting reconfiguration; risk-taking in sci-fi lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
