<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular via chemist/symphonic lens (harmonies in lattices); contradictory impulses (rigid chains vs. adaptable networks) act in foam-tracing beat, earning proposal choice with grief-cost. Blind spot to ethics compounds before insight. Final renunciation of philosophy forecloses path with embodied release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure via foam convergence reweighting premise ("divergence was not failure"); cost legible in "last tight knot of grief loosened." Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. Micro-choices interleave reflection without flattening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ravine/foam constrains insight and charges final image ("gilding the foam patterns"); sensory hierarchy (chemist notes surfactants, symphonic traces flow) filters bias. Chrysalis as micro-setting evolves with perception. Evolving details (mist to sunlight) mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atone via reconnection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in foam beat narrowing philosophy options. Agency in attention/kneeling; cost felt in grief dissolution charging poise. No reversal needed under lens; pressure coheres to CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (streams/polymers braid ethics); final image ("fragile threads of repair") offers non-literal answer reweighting separation without moral. Resonance from irony (chemist learns from nature). No tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with symphonic/chemist perceptual signature ("symphonically minded nature perceived"); rhythm modulates from ache to lightness. No elision/head-hopping; diction biases selective (mineral scent vs. solvents).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in final third ("walked on," "walked the path," grief variants) dull closure image slightly (−0.6). No heavy artifacts; metaphors coherent (braided flow). Propulsion strong in foam beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: polymer ethics + symphonic ravine epiphany transforms redemption trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off at foam insight. No derivative echoes; particular voice anchors.</comment>
