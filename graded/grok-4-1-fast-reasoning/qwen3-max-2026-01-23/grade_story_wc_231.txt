<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in witnessed isolation intensifies compellingly to kinship via concrete interiority; micro-choices like tracing the smudge and pressing the flower reveal values with cost. Mild internal conflict lacks simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via observed gaps to CR closure in pressing flower and vigil; legible cost in tears and purpose reconfiguration. Fits single-scene defaults with clean orientation by dock descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (mist muffling waves, violet bruise) filtered through keeper's bias purposefully mirrors solitude; opal dock and Edelweiss constrain decoding and charge final sacred-space image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode gesture signaled early escalates accumulatively as gaps narrow to release narrative; agency in observation forecloses chasing facts with kinship cost legible in tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth in gaps/witnessed isolation emerges organically from particulars like alpine vs. coastal flower; resonant CR reweights premise in final vigil without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing absences/gaps); voice modulates lyrically with intensity, diction biased toward borrowed solitude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel but final-third synonym churn ("witnessed isolation," "keeper of stories/memories," "gaps") creates paraphrase loops dulling closure image; overwrought figures like "seamless bruise" verge on muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alpine relic on coastal dock transforms isolation trope into release via gaps observation; Edelweiss mismatch heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
