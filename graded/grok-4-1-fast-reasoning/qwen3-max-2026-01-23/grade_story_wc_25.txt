<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied details like the zodiac coin's warmth and map creases, revealing contradictory patience vs. force in micro-choices; final nod to Pisces flows earned from prior causality with relational cost on Vale's awe. Voice particular and flawed competence balanced by quiet struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds impeccably: walk ID → Junction Gamma whisper → Vale's redirection → gallery reveal as DC/RR closure with legible exhaustion cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene tight without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Container labyrinth constrains acoustics and choices (e.g., "acoustic triangle" at Gamma forces whisper tactic); storm's hum and aurora ribbons filter through Kael's sensory bias, charging final hum residual in closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove subtlety via rescue) tightens causally through Vale's failed shouts narrowing to Kael's whisper agency; cost felt in Vale's pale exhaustion, though one live option foreclosure elevates it short of 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of subtlety over force emerges organically from particulars (shouts fracture, whispers guide); final map refold and container hum recharge prior images without moralizing, though Vale's "you knew my walk" borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in sound currents and flows; dialogue subtext-laden ("How?" rasps confusion yielding to awe), rhythmic control peaks in whisper beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensory, motif without loops; minor figurative density in storm ribbons purposeful, but "quiet affirmation" paraphrase in final lines nudges below flawless propulsion at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of walk ID attribute, whispering gallery, and Pisces flow transforms lost-in-maze trope; calculated spontaneity risks quiet closure that heightens stakes through irreplaceable container acoustics.</comment>
