<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in locket and sister's memory drives all choices credibly, culminating in the geode touch where intention yields restoration with embodied tears. Internal conflict limited to resolute quest without simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from coffee spiral to geode climax; Resonant Reconfiguration closure via gravity stilling and sealed flowers reconfigures memory premise with legible emotional cost in tears/salt dust paths. Orientation anchored early (Elara/docks/whale dawn); shards (docks-cottage-cliffs) transition legibly without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt crystals and gravity pockets constrain navigation (stumble/lift/pin) and charge final equilibrium hum. Sensory selection (prismatic shards, salt dust tears) purposeful, POV-biased toward sailor's intuition and gleaming silence motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate deleted memories) signaled via locket urgency, tightens through coffee directive and gravity peril forcing adaptive intuition to geode; agency in pouring longing yields restoration with emotional cost (decades absence balm). Escalation coheres texturally without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memories stored/reclaimed emerges organically from quest particulars, final image of lanterns' golden path reweighting silence from empty to resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (salt-heavy air, gleaming silence); rhythmic control modulates from echoing flint to humming resolution under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., fingers/calloused/rope-steel anchor traits/environment); "gleaming silence" motif purposeful but repetitive phrasing risks minor loop in high-pressure chamber beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coffee divination, gravity perils, salt-geode memory vault transforms memory-loss trope; whale inciting tear risks bold closure reconfiguration.</comment>
