<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied resolve ("hauntingly optimistic resolve settled in her bones") and micro-choices in stitching convergences, revealing values; tears in central chamber earn endurance with felt cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to strong, not exceptional; no blind spots compound pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via path convergences to central chamber closure (circle sewn around basin, tied to orchid) as resonant reconfiguration with legible emotional cost (tears tracing cheeks). Orientation anchored early; one tightening at triple-path alcove suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (honeyed orchid fragrance, stone's hum) filter through Elara's reverent bias; labyrinth walls constrain stitches at fissures and charge final image (thread to orchid stem). Micro-setting (basin crack) mirrors renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend labyrinth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dream-path overlaps narrowing certainty to central convergence; agency in selective stitching forecloses erasure with tears as cost, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate renewal emerges organically from stitching scars; final tying to resilient orchid offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting ruin without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature ("stone hummed with echoes"); rhythmic diction modulates from precise method to mantra-like whispers, consistent under resolve; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyric metaphors integrated into action ("needle dipping into a fissure marked by her sleepwalking foot"); minor figurative density borders overwriting but pattern-taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-sewing to alchemize precedents transforms labyrinth trope; risk in moon-silk method heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via path overlaps.</comment>
