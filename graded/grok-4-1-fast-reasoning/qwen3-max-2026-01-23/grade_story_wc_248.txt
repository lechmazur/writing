<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Analytically intuitive trait shines in decoding scars as notation, earning redemption arc with embodied tears tracing "clean paths through the grime"; contradictory destruction-to-preservation impulses act on-page, but minor diagnostic labels like "volcanic tenderness" slightly abstract interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as trail density tightens to CR closure at canticle reveal with legible cost ("each stroke a vow of atonement"); orientation anchored early in archive quest, single scene coherent, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive micro-setting constrains path via collapsed shelves and artifacts like abalone mosaic, charging final copying image; sensory details (lantern beam, moonlight) purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake deepens decisively at scarred portrait (density break under Accumulative lens), narrowing to humming agency with felt emotional cost; no reversal needed, but external pressure subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Preservation-over-destruction theme emerges organically from trail particulars, resonant CR in "green shoot of...redemption" reweighting premise without moralizing; final image non-literal answer to arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct poetic texture in syntax/rhythm (e.g., "boots whispered"); perceptual bias via analytical intuition selective; purposeful elevation fits literary aims, minor uniformity in long sentences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language in most climax sentences (e.g., "tears, hot as embers yet gentle as dew" amid stacked metaphors) overwrites pressure without pattern payoff; "tender" repeats 4x create minor loop; high density otherwise propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist redemption via encoded art trail transforms trope organically; scarred portrait turn inevitable from particulars, risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
