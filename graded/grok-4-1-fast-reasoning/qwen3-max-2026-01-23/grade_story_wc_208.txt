<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied tears and calloused hands revealing contradictory fear-faith under storm pressure; final carving choice earned by ancestral motivation, foreclosing tech reliance with felt emotional cost. Micro-choices in knife work hierarchy values. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories and carving tightens to Charged Poise closure where seabird carving reconfigures isolation into communion; cost legible in endured storm and tears, with turbine hum as persistent constraint shaping reverie. Single scene, orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archway and turbine hum constrain carving site and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (hum into bones, rain paths) POV-filtered by sculptor's tidal lens, evolving with storm's relent. Micro-setting of driftwood and knife tactilely lived-in, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (re-navigate post-GPS) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via carving/memory density forcing endurance; one tightening in lightning-guided knife work narrows to ancestral stance, with legible cost in tears and storm exposure charging poise. Agency in focused attention forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Timewoven alliances emerge organically from slide/carving particulars, shifting to resonant non-literal answer in confident footsteps reweighting tech-fear into faith; ambiguity lingers in tradition-innovation coexistence without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (tides/tools bias); rhythmic prose modulates reverie intensity, diction purposeful and character-bound. Experimental lyric compression taught early via hum, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each shaving released tension"); varied rhythm propels despite heavy figurative weave purposeful to reverie—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors dulling closure carving image. Minor overwriting in descriptive peaks contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancestral slide, turbine hum, and driftwood carving transforms lost-in-storm trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via timewoven premise, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
