<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices in Kael's trembling hands at the unhook, earning change; minor diagnostic labels like "sincerely insincere reassurance" slightly abstract interiority without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with chime patterns tightening to RR closure; unhooking and shard drop as decisive reconfiguration with legible emotional cost in Kael's whisper "I clutched a lie."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wind chimes as recurring object constrain choices and charge final harmonious melody; dawn light and gusts evolve tactilely, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guilt release signaled early, accumulatively deepens via chime decodings narrowing Kael's certainty; agency in self-unhook forecloses doubt path with visible tear and breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nuance theme emerges organically from chimes' shifting song reweighting certainty; final image of released shard offers resonant answer, though line "Nuance does not erase responsibility" borders direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature filters through lighthouse keeper's bias; dialogue subtextual and idiomatic, with distinct voices in Kael's gruffness vs. Elara's gentle murmurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel to closure, with varied sentence openings; minor figurative density in opening ("cloak of doubt—a heavy, homespun garment") risks overwrite but stays coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wind chimes as emotional decoder transforms redemption trope; conscience-for-hire premise and object evolution feel inevitable and riskily poetic without gimmickry.</comment>
