<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to thaw mistrust drives reciprocal projection of Kael's symbols, earning his change with vulnerability cost; micro-choices like sketching symbols reveal values without contradiction. Kael's silence as misunderstood isolation transforms via on-page tear and nod. Minor telling in final realization slightly undercuts embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: symbol density builds from doodles to projections to community seeds, reconfiguring trust. Closure as Charged Poise lands in Kael's palm on key and ongoing tickets, with legible relational cost in crumbling isolation. Orientation anchored early; brief "next dusk" shard fits defaults without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Crystal spires amplify light/symbols, constraining projection choice and charging final humming chorus image. Rain-softened cobblestones and dew integrate tactilely via Elara's movement. Sensory hierarchy (hum, gleam, moisture) reflects Elara's reverent priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transparency vs. mistrust) signaled early, tightens via recognition of Kael's willow/bridge/key, forcing reciprocal projection that narrows isolation options. Escalation driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens; cost felt in Kael's tear tracing "path through the dust."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of honesty as courageous reflection emerges from symbols' "ambiguously clear" truths, reweighting via jasmine reprise and "seeds" without moralizing. Final image ("crystals hum their agreement") offers non-literal answer, embracing mystery's space. Counter-reading in retained silence adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (symbols as "emotional landscapes"); diction/rhythm modulate from reverent hush to wonder. No head-hopping or withholding; lyric compression taught early via lens/symbols pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ink trembled with unshed tears" advances emotion/causality); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in opening figuration ("veil of starlight, each quartz spire dripping") risks coherence, but purposeful pattern holds. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-verbal world, doodle symbology, and lens-projection transforms isolation trope via irreplaceable crystal amplification. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; hindsight inevitability in "doodles were never cryptic—they were invitations."</comment>
