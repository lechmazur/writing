<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as historian intensifies through summoning memories without lingering grief, earning final resolve; benevolent ruthlessness constrains micro-choices like flowing into "wait," revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as spelled words build density to "remember" cascade, delivering CR closure where whispers reprice pawnless board's absence as fertile purpose with conceptual cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Domed gallery's clinging sound and fractured light constrain sacred geometry walks and charge chessboard placement; dust motes as stars mirror internal transmutation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of preserving gestures vs. erasure tightens accumulatively through memory summonings narrowing to chorus, forcing agency in unbinding with felt cost of honored pain in penultimate silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emergent theme of gestures over rulers answered non-literally by whispers filling chessboard voids, reweighting interregnum premise without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward archival humanity; rhythmic syntax echoes walking patterns, e.g., deliberate S-H-A-R-E propulsion modulates emotional intensity consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion in sensory integration like "sunlight bled through fractures"; minor density drag from stacked metaphors in opening (e.g., "moths to fragile flame") without closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Word-spelling walks to unbind memories transforms ritual preservation ingeniously, synthesizing post-crisis tropes into fresh conceptual repricing; bold lyric risk heightens stakes organically.</comment>
