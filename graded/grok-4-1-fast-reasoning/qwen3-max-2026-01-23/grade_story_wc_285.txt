<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in thumb-tracing the needle amid grief layers, earning the final certainty with contradictory regret-hope impulses acting in reflective micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density to silence signaling CR closure; cost legible in "weight in his chest transformed into quiet certainty" as fog lifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>River mist, plinks, and yarn needle constrain attentive vigil and charge final image of pressed needle guiding forward path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of distilling promise tightens at final plink-silence under accumulative lens, agency in focused listening foreclosing regret with reconfigured emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ending image of "love’s persistent thread—strong enough to mend any tear" resonantly reweights literal promise via particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature in ambient details like "each metallic plink"; rhythmic control heightens reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory motifs without loops; purposeful repetition of "promise" accumulates texture, minor figurative density in reflection coherent at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of yarn needle as mnemonic anchor transforms grief vigil into perceptual epiphany, risk-taking in textured lyricism heightens stakes.</comment>
