<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory skeptic-kind impulses act simultaneously when she dismisses lore but places the tile for Liam, earning her final vulnerability-sharing choice with embodied tears and softened skepticism. Flawless micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from tile discovery to surging visions; CR closure lands cleanly in dawn transcription and Liam's softening with felt emotional cost in "tears streamed freely; skepticism...bowed." Orientation anchored immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (salt wind, starlight on obsidian) filter through skeptic POV, constraining alignment via meridian flagstone and charging final dawn whales image. Tower/sea evolve causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. solace-provision) signaled early, deepens via visions' density surge forcing stance crystallization; agency in alignment/transcription forecloses doubt-path with legible tear-cost, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of entangled resilience emerges organically from visions weaving human/whale endurance, reweighting premise in final "notes in the song" image without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "unheard symphony."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (cataloging "absurdities" amid warmth) with rhythmic modulation under stress; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in Liam's whisper advancing closure without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively; minor figurative density ("symphony of pure resonance") in peak visions risks slight coherence dip but stays purposeful/legible without loops or scaffolds touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh entanglement of whale migrations/stargazer memories transforms artifact trope into resonant CR; bold lyric synthesis feels inevitable, risking ornate prose that heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
