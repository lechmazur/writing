<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation intensely rooted in button rituals and prophecy cipher belief, earning resolve change; embodied focus amid crack reveals resilience, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal unscrambling beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in mosaic realization ("black sand...call to action"); legible cost in foreclosed fatalism and resolve to village, suspended grain charging final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory honeyed gloom and crack constrain choices (deepening focus), buttons/echo jar as micro-settings charge ending image of mended stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant prophecy stake signaled early, accumulatively tightens via unscrambling reversal narrowing fatalism options; agency in cataloging bears felt cost of active weaving over passivity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fragments-to-tapestry theme emerges organically from buttons/echo, CR ending reweights prophecy via communal call without literal moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with biased perceptual signature (time as grain/hand); rhythmic syntax modulates pressure, purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated image/action; minor "quietly" motif repetition voice-motivated without loop, no figurative muddle in climax unscrambling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ingenious buttons-mosaic unscrambling prophecy transforms fatalism trope; fresh jar/echo synthesis inevitable in hindsight, bold lyric risk heightens resonance.</comment>
