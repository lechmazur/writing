<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and quiet rebellion shown through drumming actions and tears at dream formation; contradictory love/loss impulses act in the peak beat without tidy resolution. Minor abstraction in "quiet fire" interiority doesn't flatten pressure. Final resolve earned by prior sensory buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drumming builds density to Charged Poise closure as dream solidifies then fades into "a single chime lingered," reconfiguring options with felt sorrow cost. Orientation anchored early at lagoon/garden. No slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden/lagoon constrain choices via resonant materials for drumming and charge final "new depth, charged with latent potential." Sensory integration (thrum-released scents, blooming waves) mirrors internal states purposefully. 9+ gate met without generic slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild dream) escalates accumulatively via polyrhythm tightening to temporary success then fade; agency in fervent drumming forecloses permanence with legible tear/sorrow cost. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistent love against oblivion emerges organically from drumming particulars and fading figures; final "seed of memory" offers non-literal resonance reweighting fragility without moralizing. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing (sound-to-light/scent); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to fervent beats. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory action, but minor overwrite in repeated "auroral sorrow" variations dulls one peak sentence without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds; figurative pattern purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic sci-fi rebellion transforms memory trope via drumming mechanics and garden rules; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes inevitable at "seed planted deep." No derivative echoes.</comment>
