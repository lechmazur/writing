<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and arc: contradictory resistance to change clashes with observations, culminating in earned surrender with embodied tears and stone placement. Stone as talisman reveals flaws and drives micro-choices under pressure. Minor label-speak in "luminous regret" but doesn't flatten peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footage comparison builds density to pattern break (shadow as catalyst), delivering CR closure via stone's radiance and regret-cost realization. One tightening sufficient; orientation anchored early in library intro. No slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (humming air, breathing shelves) filters through Elara's priorities, constraining dusk observations and charging final vine pulse. Stone micro-setting evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope vs. shadow) deepens accumulatively through footage revelation, forcing stance shift with visible regret/tears cost. Agency in deliberate comparison narrows options; single tightening coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of evolving hope emerges organically from shadow/stone particulars, resonant CR in final image reweights stasis premise without moralizing. Minor overtness in "beauty requires contrast" line slightly undercuts ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature (sharp-eyed noticing) biases details consistently; rhythm modulates with emotional peaks like stone warming. Purposeful compression legible, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("shadow unbound," "softly deliberate" phrasing) and synonym churn in vine descriptions dull propulsion slightly. No artifacts harm closure; metaphors consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-library premise with shadow-as-catalyst twist, transformed via stone evolution; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
