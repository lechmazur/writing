<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to recycle mistakes is embodied via the drawer pull, anchoring backstory to present choices with earned internal shift at "a loosening of invisible chains." Minor flaw: internal conflict feels retrospective rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, slightly muting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from anticipation to prisoner release, landing Charged Poise closure in final image of drawer pull as "key to a drawer holding not regret, but resolve" with legible emotional cost of softened memory. Single continuous scene fits scope; orientation anchored early in parapet/mist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet, mist, and wind constrain staging and mirror internal states, evolving causally ("sweeping mist seaward") to charge final threshold image. Drawer pull as micro-setting recurs to constrain reflection and reweight closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of successful untethering escalates via textural density from "aching liminal space" to release nod, narrowing to internal reconfiguration with visible cost in "sharp edges...softened." Agency in nod/protocol feels earned but lacks sharper trade-off under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes emerges organically from Veridian failure to drawer pull reprise, offering resonant non-literal answer in final line without moralizing. Moon and mist particulars shift meaning, embracing ambiguity of "long road" ahead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in elemental biases ("raw honesty of this place") and rhythmic modulation under anticipation sustain single POV. Voice texture controlled, with syntax reflecting solemn resolve; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in reflective beats (e.g., "recycled into wisdom...recycled into the meticulous protocols") dull propulsion slightly without obscuring closure. Varied syntax and vivid specifics propel accumulatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moon-phase sync and drawer pull transform prisoner exchange trope into philosophical fresh angle, with risk-taking in lyric closure heightening stakes organically. Transformation test passes: elements interlock uniquely.</comment>
