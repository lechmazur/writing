<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like tracing cracks amid "dizzying light-dance," reveal hierarchy of values; final tear as earned release forecloses fraying hope with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (duty to visceral imperative) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chaos to hush bloom as RR closure with legible cost in "tear traced... through grime." Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored by ~30 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cracks as micro-setting constrain ritual choice and charge final "concentric circles" image; sensory hierarchy (sonic fractures, luminous pulse) POV-specific and evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim quiet) signaled early, deepens via anomaly discovery narrowing options; agency in inward summons forces trade-off, cost felt in "frantic buzz ceased" shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-resilient-order emerges organically via hush weaving "chaotic threads"; final "quiet alive with stone, ice, and calmed light" reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (ripple-marks as "frozen history") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual's inward turn, stable close third-person limited.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied syntax breathes with hush expansion—no loops, though "gently luminous" pattern borders density but teaches payoff in ice record.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sonic cartography premise synthesizes fresh fantasy with irreplaceable hush bloom; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in "hammered repose."</comment>
