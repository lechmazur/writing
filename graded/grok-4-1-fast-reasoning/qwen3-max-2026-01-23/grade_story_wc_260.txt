<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in shoulder tension release after first shedding; motivation to reconstruct trust compels micro-choices like whispering and sketching. Contradictory impulses (open heart vs. discernment) act simultaneously in sequential sheddings. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("shed indiscriminate trust") tidyies epiphanies without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via layered sheddings toward Charged Poise closure in talisman necklace. Orientation anchored by word 38 (workshop, Elara, tail tip). Cost legible in "tempered... flexible, resilient" convictions and worn box foreclosing naive trust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring objects (tail tip to velvet box to necklace) constrain choices and charge final image; mist/stars evolve from possessive curl to dissolving dawn, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (herbal scents, hearth crackle) filtered through handler's priorities integrates seamlessly. Workshop micro-setting guides reconstruction sketches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct post-betrayal trust) signaled early; accumulative escalation via shedding tightens to synthesis, narrowing naive compassion. Agency in internal micro-choices (whispering, visualizing gatekeeper) forecloses cynicism path with vigilance cost. Pressure coheres internally without external reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassion/self-respect balance emerges organically from shedding particulars; final dawn image reweights betrayal as "sacred synthesis" without statement. Chameleon survival motif shifts from terror symbol to adaptive wisdom, charging closure non-literally. Complexity lingers in tempered-not-shattered convictions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("quietly vivid tapestry," skin-shifting chameleon) biases toward natural harmony; rhythmic modulation accelerates in dawn breath. Lyrical compression taught early sustains lyric mode legibly to closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Generation artifacts (per-sentence word counts like (38)) pervade, disrupting read-aloud rhythm and proof consistency; apply -1.2 under patterned-artifact pack as they touch final third. Dense figurative overwriting ("crushing weight... clearer alloy of wisdom," mixed metaphor) in every reflective beat lacks pattern payoff (-0.6). Minor paraphrase loops in sequential sheddings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms betrayal recovery into "shedding layers" chameleon-parallel arc, culminating in talisman as balance emblem. Tropes (trust shattered, dawn renewal) personalized via wildlife handler's specifics. Risks lyric internality coherently without gimmick.</comment>
