<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in lifelong vow compels all micro-choices like scattering pods and watering; embodied emotion peaks in "throat tightened" and tears. Interiority concrete via bird translations revealing scar-weight. Minimal contradictory impulses limit perfection, but endurance earns final certainty with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: bird calls accumulate guidance tightening stake from soil prep to root emergence. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Kael at twilight jetty). Closure as CR in "faint, defiant thread of green" reconfigures submerged concord with emotional cost legible in smile and certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight constrains choices via bird-directed soil and water; sensory hierarchy (plover cry, cormorant croak) filters through Kael's attribute. Final green thread charges closure image, mirroring internal shift. Micro-setting (groaning planks, splintered piling) evolves with actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclaiming battlefield) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bird deepening (plover→nightingale) narrowing to eastern seam and root. Agency in fertilizing actions forecloses doubt with tears/certainty cost. No reversal needed; density reweights hope against history.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of amending scars via life-over-brutality emerges from seed-scattering and bird-guided acts, not statement. Nightingale sonnet and green thread offer resonant CR answer to concord's dormancy without moralizing. Subtext in "ivy over stone" lingers via charged final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: dead languages in "plover’s sharp cry" and bird idioms. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from descriptive to compressed at "tears traced clean paths." No dialogue; voice coherent, biased to echoes in nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "groaning planks" evokes history/setting/action); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling") during setup, but purposeful for tone; no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bird-translated dead languages fertilize battlefield garden, transforming tropes of renewal via "narrow vastness." Risky attribute enables turns organically; final green thread feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
