<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's curse vision of scattering stones creates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously with her anchoring breath; palm-on-stone climax embodies earned shift to pattern keeper with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds ritual density to on-page RR (friction circle) with legible cost ("pouch of star dust felt lighter"); orientation anchored in opening lines, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frictionless details (pebbles drifting, waves as mercury) constrain ritual via magnetic boots and necessitate bluff site; aurora coils to focus energy, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Curse vision deepens stake before restoration forecloses slide with aurora-dimming cost; agency in chant and dust-sprinkling drives tightening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Eels weaving living spiral reconfigures herding premise into harmony invitation, resonating theme without moralizing; final reset offers non-literal answer to pattern resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (pi/phi etchings, cosmic resonance) biases noticing toward sacred math; stable close-3rd POV modulates rhythm with ritual intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm in ritual beats; controlled poetic diction ("liquid mercury") avoids muddle, though minor elevated register risks in visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frictionless physics + math-rock ritual synthesizes fresh sci-fantasy premise; eels' pattern response risks boldly for conceptual payoff.</comment>
