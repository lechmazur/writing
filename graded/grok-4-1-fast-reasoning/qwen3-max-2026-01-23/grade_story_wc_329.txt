<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in persistent failure turning to heart-driven vulnerability, with embodied pain ("fingers tearing on stone-thorns") earning the final offering. Contradictory impulses—technical perfection vs. authentic pulse—act in the playing beat. Minor epiphanic phrasing in final lines ("continuous choice") is hairline, not touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resonance builds from whisper notes to orchard eruption (DC shatter + RR rebirth). Cost legible in "resolve burning away pain" during uproot. One tightening via statue cracks enabling descent narrows options perfectly for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard and statues constrain descent and uproot, with locust shell as micro-setting charging final image by sapling. Sensory hierarchy (buzz, blush, scent) filters through Elara's perceptual bias. Vivid integration like "cracks like veins of light" mirrors internal bridge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) tightens accumulatively: soft music fractures statues, forcing descent/uproot with thorn pain as visible cost. Agency in shell-heart signal forecloses mechanical path. Escalation coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerable persistence emerges from heart rhythm vs. stone control, reweighted in final image of shell holding "echo of courage." No moralizing; complexity in scars-to-grace lingers authentically. Orchard eruption offers non-literal answer to mechanical slumber.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with resonant diction ("vibrated down the cables") stable in single POV, perceptual signature musical and embodied. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in playing/uproot beats. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/pressure without loops. "Resonantly soft" motif purposeful, not artifact. Minor repetition in wonder phrasing contained, no muddle in climax shatter beat; ear test varies rhythm cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heart-shell signal transforming statue-policed orchard; risk in soft vulnerability heightens stakes organically. Locust shell reprise inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes, full premise commitment.</comment>
