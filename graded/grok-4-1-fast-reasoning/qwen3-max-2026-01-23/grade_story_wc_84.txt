<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to decode belonging intensifies through embodied anticipation ("thrum in his chest," trembling hands), earning the relational closure. Elara's surprise trait softens his edges without dominating. Minor slip: epiphany feels slightly tidy without deeper contradictory impulses in peak pull/insert moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain excels: drone's star-trail alignment → fracture discovery → stone pull → chip insertion → orrery awakening with RR closure ("final missing piece... clicked seamlessly"). Orientation anchored immediately in observatory/mission. Cost legible in solitude's dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's arches, mosaics, flagstone fracture constrain pivotal pull and charge final golden light image. Sensory vividness (gravel crunch, gears groaning) filtered through Kael's pilot precision. Dusk's progression mirrors stakes without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chip recovery for belonging) tightens via drone convergence and stone pull, narrowing options with agency. Emotional cost of prior "hollow ache" foreclosed in connection. Minor abstractness in "frequency" declaration slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Belonging emerges organically from chip/orrery activation to relational touch, reweighting solitude in final image without moralizing. Subtext in Elara's wonder vs. Kael's precision enriches complexity. Resonant non-literal answer in "new constellation... of shared presence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person on Kael with perceptual signature (pilot-honed eyes on stars/drone). Poetic rhythm modulates tension, dialogue sparse/natural/subtextual ("heavens are pulling truth"). No head-hopping; diction fits world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; purposeful figures ("diamond dust," "brass flower") enhance without muddle. Propulsion peaks in "gritty sigh... definitive click." Clean, immersive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech in ancient star observatory transforms tropes into "type foundry matrix" ingenuity driving belonging theme. Risky poetic tone heightens cosmic stakes organically.</comment>
