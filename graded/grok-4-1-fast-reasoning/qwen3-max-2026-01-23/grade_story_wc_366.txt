<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices in dismantling and restacking stones reveal a hierarchy of values—duty, memory, hope—with embodied contradictory sorrow/solace; final guardianship endurance earned by prior memory anchors. No unearned epiphanies; backstory tilts present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observation/memory builds to Phoenix Stack as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring absence into continuity; cost legible in "luminescent ache blending sorrow... with solace." Orientation anchored immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresnel lens fracturing moonlight into "spectral rainbows" and cold teacup constrain perception/action, charging final stack image where room "transforms" and shadows soften. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (dust motes, brass scent); lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard legacy amid lamp's darkness/Hemlock's absence) signaled early, deepens texturally via stone disassembly/reassembly narrowing doubt to vow; agency in "Phoenix Stack" crystallizes stance with emotional cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of enduring care via silent gestures emerges organically from stone chain/stacking; final image of stack as "anonymous letter to the keeper arriving at dawn" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation into rebellion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited with perceptual signature (tide/sea metaphors like "words measured in tides"); rhythmic modulation builds to peak compression in stacking beat. No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor figurative density ("moonlight bled... spectral rainbows danced like forgotten promises") in opener risks coherence but pattern-taught via sea/light motifs; no loops/artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone cairns as "anonymous letter chain" transforms lighthouse isolation trope; sea glass signature/Phoenix Stack feel inevitable, risk-taking in textural lyricism heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
