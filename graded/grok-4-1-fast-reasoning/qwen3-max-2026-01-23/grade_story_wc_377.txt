<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder roots consistently in her muteness and elders' plea, shown through precise adjustments and final touch on the dull fragment. Interiority feels embodied in vibrations up her boots and light on skin during crescendo. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup from vane push to crescendo reconfigures meaning with cost in "It had surrendered its light completely." Single scene oriented early, closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with undeniable conceptual price of temporary preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment and bronze arcs constrain choices (sun angle, silver cradle) and charge final dulling image. Sensory details (wind murmurs, sapphire sparks) filter through Elara's harmonic bias, vivid and purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. gray forgetting) signaled early via elders' plea; vane push escalates density to crescendo under accumulative lens, foreclosing easy stasis with ongoing retuning cost. Agency in her initiation tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of non-verbal truth emerges organically from symphony weaving sound/light, reweighted in final silence where "wonder not only endured but quietly flourished." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like ice's glisten ties to Elara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature attuned to "subtle harmonics" and vibrations; rhythm modulates from precise adjustments to immersive crescendo without filter excess. Diction purposeful, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short crescendo sentences, breathing silence); high density integrates sensory propulsion without loops, though minor "glisten" recurrences border pattern but serve payoff. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-verbal world, ice-shard symphonies, and muted vigor transforms preservation trope; risk in kinetic light/sound convergence feels inevitable from bluff's whispers to final covenant.</comment>
