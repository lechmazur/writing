<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to find story beginnings roots actions consistently and compels the incision choice; interiority concrete in ritual but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during the pivotal cut, reducing embodied conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to CR closure in Elara's transformation and book offering, with legible cost in abandoned vendor role; single scene anchors orientation early, one tightening via incision surge suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard's crystalline details constrain choice via resonant gap and charge final nursery image; sensory hierarchy (chiming, glow) filters through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog, evolving causally to cradle clouds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing story essence tightens via incision under Accumulative lens, narrowing to success with felt cost of personal vial's expenditure; patron arrival complicates without resolving, but internal pressure lacks visceral opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of quantified absence birthing narrative emerges organically from particulars like shelf gap and moonlight tome; final image reweights archive-to-nursery without moral, inviting ambiguity on creation's edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "serene dissonance"); rhythmic texture modulates to charged poise at patron's question, patron's brief dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative layering (e.g., "fragments coalesced") in peak incision borders overwriting without full pattern payoff, dulling slight momentum; no loops, clean syntax varies rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library as story nursery via quantified absence and moonlight ritual feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation transforms tropes without gimmickry, heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
