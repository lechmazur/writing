<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through inventive actions like using the sundial code, rooted in consistent vigilance that pivots to revolution; interiority concrete in "calmly inventive, his mind already turning the crisis into opportunity." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on page, preventing 9+; change in purpose earned with cost of secrecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout therefore sundial sparks therefore archive entry/transcription therefore escape under returning lights; orientation anchored early ("Luminous Fort... Aris, the vigilant lock sentinel"). Closure as Charged Poise/CR in "bronze cylinder was warm, full of a fire" reconfigures vigilance with conceptual cost of future exposure risk, legible in timing slip-out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sundial's coded grooves constrain pivotal spark choice and charge final image ("washing the sundial... hiding its codes once more"); sensory details purposeful (twilight embers, spark travel) filtered through Aris's priorities. 9+ gate met; spatial choreography coherent throughout single scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution via truths) signaled early, tightens causally at archive entry and transcribing under blackout's time pressure ("first faltering flicker... pulsed overhead" forecloses options). Agency drives escalation; cost legible in rushed exit and sealed copies' risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of illumination-through-truth emerges organically from sparks-to-docs-to-pages motif, culminating in resonant CR ("two lights: the one from the ceilings, and the one from these pages") without moralizing. Final image reweights monopoly premise with non-literal social cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (light/geometry bias: "tracing the angles like lightning in miniature"); rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early ("winking hush") legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("struck them together over... cradle of sparks"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("lightning in miniature... soft, new glow") slightly muddles peak spark beat, but clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-code intrigue and quill-secret transforms tropes (guardian betrays for truth); flint-spark mechanism non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Risky fantasy logic consistent, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
