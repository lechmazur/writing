<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via visions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during psychometry; competent handling shows no flaws compounding into struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("unused love is stored in the silence after goodbyes"); legible conceptual cost in internal reconfiguration, one deepening via dimensional archive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Projection booth and film strip as micro-settings constrain spatial mapping/projection and charge final pulsing; sensory evolution mirrors internal surge purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively via incubated visions narrowing to realization; agency in psychometry/endurance of sorrow yields felt emotional cost at thunder's crest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of love's storage emerges organically from letter visions to resonant silence image; final reconfiguration reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with spatial perceptual signature apt for POV; stable distance, purposeful motif compression taught early, but minor register elevation in epiphanies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("hushed thunder," "forgotten lyrics") across final third dull propulsion; dense figuratives without variation in single high-pressure beat obscure crispness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh psychometry-film synthesis for unused love repository transforms mystic tropes via spatial archive; risky lyric motifs heighten resonance inevitably.</comment>
