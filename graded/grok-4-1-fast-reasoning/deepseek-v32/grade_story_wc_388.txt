<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as truth-seeker, but interiority relies on labels like "sharply observant eyes missed nothing" rather than embodied contradiction; no on-page micro-choices show conflicting impulses under pressure, flattening emotional depth at discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: reassembling letters → map → diamond refraction → hatch; on-page closure as Conceptual Repricing when Kael emerges with "enlightened" diamond, reweighting curse as key with felt cost of entrenched lies ahead; orientation anchored early in orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Radioactive dust storms pressure waiting for sun break, constraining diamond use; orchard's thriving trees and soil deposits echo diamond flaws, charging final emergence; sensory details like "boots crunching on soil layered with radioactive dust" integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find stillpoint tightens causally through piecing letters and refraction beam narrowing to specific tree; agency in digging reveals truth with conceptual cost of "comfortable lies entrenched"; no reversal but deepening suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of excavating truth from lies emerges via diamond's shift from curse to key and stillpoint records exposing liquidation; final image of Kael carrying diamond into storms offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward patterns ("subtle symmetry in its branches"); voice texture consistent but some register drift to elevated diction like "trapped stars"; no head-hopping, elision minimal and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops like "sharply observant," "intuited," and "excavated truth" across beats create template cadence, dulling momentum; overwriting in "flaws catching the light like trapped stars" mixes metaphors without payoff; density solid but artifacts cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc debunker using geological diamond key in thriving orchard transforms tropes; final reconfiguration of "cursed" diamond as truth symbol feels earned from prior particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
