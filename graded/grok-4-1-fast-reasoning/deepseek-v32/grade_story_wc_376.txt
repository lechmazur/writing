<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's "wilts near dishonesty" trait consistently constrains choices like avoiding the market and telling truth to the guard, earning her final strengthening; minor epiphanic summaries dilute embodied contradiction in the revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through discovery density (map-chamber-revelation), with CR closure in "city stirred with revelation... began to heal" carrying wilting/city thirst cost; multi-shard transitions legible, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse domes, vines cracking glass, and zinc chamber constrain quest (humid corridors, rust-sealed door) and charge final image of etched plates mirroring her art; selective sensory details (humid, gleaming) integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find lost conversations) tightens accumulatively via council revelation narrowing options to etch/distribute truth; agency in piecing/venturing bears wilting cost, legible in "feeling the weight of the deception."</comment>
<question>5</grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of candor rebuilding emerges organically from wilting/honesty pattern, resonating in final zinc fragment image repricing dishonesty's toll; slips into direct statement like "candor in small moments could rebuild" slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature ("gilded-leaf," echoes of voices); minimal dialogue natural but sparse; minor repetition in phrasing erodes distinct texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Exact loops ("candor in small moments" x3, "She reread" x3, "pieced together" variants) and paraphrase redundancy in final third dull closure propulsion; rhythmic poetry strong otherwise but artifacts pervade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher questing lost words via zinc map in toxic greenhouse transforms tropes; zinc plates' evolving role offers ingenious premise payoff without gimmickry.</comment>
