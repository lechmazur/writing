<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in clinging to Lyra's appearances while driven to release her earn the final renunciation; vision of past oath roots motivation deeply without stock epiphanies. Embodied tears and venomous touch reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as bead vision triggers ritual buildup to RR closure (Lyra fades with anchor cost legible in "form faded, her debt repaid"); orientation anchored early in greenhouse details; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing flora and frost-etched glass constrain ritual choices; final dawn charges image, breaking endless night with undeniable environmental payoff on "verdant fields."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repay debt) tightens accumulatively via bead-deepening memory and ritual cadence shift; agency in chanting forecloses path with Lyra's loss cost visible in solidification-to-fade arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of warm bead and legends woven answers debt's thematic question non-literally, reweighting love's poison through orchard's fulfillment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias toward luminous plants and ash veils; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You remember"); rhythmic modulation heightens ghostly whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "ephemeral cameo appearances" slightly dull mid-section without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-trope via time-weaving orchard and bead-oath synthesis; orchard's final purpose feels inevitable from early particulars, risking lyric alchemy payoff.</comment>
