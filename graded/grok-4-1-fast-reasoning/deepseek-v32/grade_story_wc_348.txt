<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines in polymer metaphors for grief, embodied as "tight polymer chain... loosened into something more pliable," rooting motivation in profession and nature; earned change via partial ash-scattering forecloses full release with felt cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "guilt was a surfactant" edges toward abstraction but anchors in foam observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure in "his love... a growing point," reweighting grief with conceptual cost of non-reversal; foam insight as pivotal tightening narrows atonement path. Orientation anchored early in ravine walk; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Braided ravine and foam constrain insight/choice, charging chrysalis reprise in final reed placement; sensory details (sun-warmed rock, swirling ashes) filter through chemist-bias, mirroring internal braiding without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of eddies guides foam epiphany pivotal to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via foam patterns forcing synthesis over reversal; agency in partial scattering pays visible cost, altering tactics to biodegradable polymer. Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility, but internal pressure lacks one sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of divergence/confluence emerges organically from ravine/foam/chrysalis particulars, resonant CR in "braided, not broken" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image of "myriad water threads" non-literally answers separation question, tying arc inextricably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in symphonic/chemical diction ("chemical fugue," "fleeting, intricate architecture"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without elision or head-hopping. Voice as character: syntax reflects loosening grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like foam description advancing insight/action; varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor metaphor density in insight beats ("surfactant... foam into many pieces") risks coherence slip but patterns taught early without loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer chemistry, butterfly metamorphosis, and braided hydrology transforms grief trope into non-obvious polymer scaffold premise; risk in lyric accumulation heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via foam pivot.</comment>
