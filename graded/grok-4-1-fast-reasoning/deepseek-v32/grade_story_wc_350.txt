<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unify districts via music roots consistently in her choral role, driving adaptation of the small weight and new score; embodied emotions in her fingers brushing the box and bone-deep vibration earn the closure change. Minor slip in label-like "empathetically decisive" lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery and composition build density to climax playing, yielding RR closure in city response and her vibration under starlight, with cost in straining weight legible ("sound was thin at first"). One tightening via score-weaving suffices; orientation anchored early in tower chamber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower's dusty chamber, star-chart apertures, and gears constrain reading scores by starlight and shaft suspension, charging final gleaming gears image; sensory hierarchy (hush, vibration in stone) reflects her priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore unifying carillon) signaled early, tightens via small-weight adaptation under Accumulative lens, forcing score rehab; agency in playing forecloses failed search path, cost felt in initial thin sound and years' vain hunt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unity-from-diversity emerges organically from interwoven languages and silos metaphor, resonating in fusion heard below without moralizing; final image of opening silos reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in musical/geared imagery; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically to climax ("tower sang"), purposeful without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel (e.g., "harmonies built, momentum grew"); purposeful "borrowed starlight" recurrence avoids loops, but minor metaphorical density ("choral librarianship of the air") in peak risks overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock carillon, language rounds, and grain elevator silos into unification arc feels inevitable; risk-taking in tiny-weight rehab transforms trope without gimmickry.</comment>
