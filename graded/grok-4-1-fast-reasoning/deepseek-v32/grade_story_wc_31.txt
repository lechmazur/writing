<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority ties longing to embodied compulsion at pier's end, compelling purposeful wandering; earned perceptual shift forecloses prior isolation with private cost, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of hush, discovery, and realization; Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page in final pier lighting where flames sing colored, reweighting perception with legible conceptual cost of solitude ("to him alone").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory specifics like "barnacled ribs," "glowing moss," and "salt and vellum" constrain exploration and charge diagrams; wreck/library micro-setting guides inciting hole/door choice and final flame perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of synesthetic discovery signaled early tightens texturally via key-turn groan and diagram pulse, narrowing whimsy to perceptual reconfiguration; agency in wandering yields closure cost in isolated insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of layered perception emerges organically from wreck-door twist and vow-diagram; final image non-literally answers quest by recharging lanterns/pier flames without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("visual whisper," "color of its steady flame's song"); rhythmic lyricism modulates hush to hum without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density weaves image/action ("fingers brushed a rusted chain"); varied rhythm propels, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("solitary dance of flame and glass") risks slight muddle mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic wreck-library transforms magical discovery trope via lamplighter's grounded compulsion; fresh CR hinges on key-tag's improbable hotel echo, risking boldly without gimmick.</comment>
