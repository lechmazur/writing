<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of jealousy/envy act in scene via embodied hunger and flashing images, fueling writing; final integration earned by causal shift to empathy, with visible cost of prior temporal pain acknowledged on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds to pattern break (jealousy to empathy via soaring invocation), CR closure in "embraced the nonlinear flow... story was hers to shape," cost legible in terror-to-peace reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll as micro-setting constrains choice (hovered pen, furious writing) and charges final image (rolled, shelved); cabin dust/herbs/sharp air mirror dissolving chaos to anchor, sensory selective via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via image cascade → focused soaring beat narrowing to empathy turn; agency in writing/arms-raised crystallizes stance, cost felt in ash-tasting memories foreclosing linear belief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nonlinear time theme emerges organically from grave vision, jealousy method, soaring pattern; final image ("soar whenever... story hers to shape") resonant CR answer reweighting mortality without moral, complexity in jaded-to-kinship arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (organic textures vs. digital, timeline cascades); rhythmic modulation under stress (furiously writes → light body), diction biased to dream chronicler lexicon, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via image integration; minor paraphrase loops in envy/chaos concepts (-0.3) but purposeful accumulative buildup, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grave-vision prompt via jealousy-as-fuel method transforming to kinship, nonlinear embrace risks bold perception shift; final "hers to shape" inevitable from scroll/soaring particulars.</comment>
