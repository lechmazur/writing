<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation singular and intensifies through labor in tunnel, compelling trade of memories for new sounds; interiority concrete in sensory translations. Accepts cost with earned endurance, but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal tunnel scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bird patterns to echo synthesis; closure as CR in final emergence—language extinct but symphony endures—with legible cost ("each translation cost him a memory"; people gone). One tightening via diamond focusing echoes suffices; orientation anchored early in canyon/bone towers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (gritty bone, rasping melody) filter through POV's textural priorities; tunnel constrains choice as echo conduit, bone towers charge closure image ("wind swept through... carried the textures"). Micro-setting (diamond flaws scattering notes) integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve language essence) signaled early, deepens texturally via bird-pattern tactic narrowing chaos to order; agency in directing echoes forecloses old words with memory cost legible on-page. Escalation coherent without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of translation's cost emerges organically from texture-to-sound labor and curse inversion; final image ("towers... now sang with the stories of their own substance") offers resonant CR reweighting loss as sensory truth, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in precise, textured noticing (metallic filaments, brittle chime); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet observation to authoritative weaving, matching quietly articulate trait without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence lengths; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (echoes as "layered tapestry," diamond "scattering light like fractured notes"). Minor repetition of "across the death" motif enhances textural accumulation without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed diamond, bird patterns, and echo physics births new language from dying one; risk in blurring time/cost transforms tropes organically, inevitable in hindsight via storyteller's singular drive.</comment>
