<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove care over luck roots consistently in pragmatic traits and rituals, compelling higher-stakes choices like leading the villager; interiority concrete via polishing meditation. Minor flaw: internal conflict mostly declarative rather than simultaneous impulses acting in pivotal confession recall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of rituals and garden responses building to CR closure: villager abandons meter after seeing responsive vine, reweighting luck premise with Elara's persistence cost. Orientation anchored early in maze; one tightening via villager confrontation narrows skepticism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden maze vividly specific with vines curling to footsteps and rustling gratitude, constraining navigation to central vine that charges closure image. Sensory selection POV-biased toward tactile care; recurring pedestal marbles mirror internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove care > luck—tightens accumulatively via meter skepticism forcing demonstration; agency in showing vine and marbles forecloses doubt with villager's realization cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of care's dialogue with earth emerges organically from marble rituals and vine responses, resonating in final polish without overt moral. Direct line "The garden knows me" slightly echoes thesis, muting subtext in confrontation climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct poetic texture in syntax and perceptual bias toward fragility/resilience; dialogue sparse but natural/subtextual ("Measure this"). Rhythmic modulation fits meditative tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "polished marble" and victories (e.g., multiple near-identical ritual descriptions) plus template cadence in "She [action], [reflection]" runs dull density; artifacts touch final polish beat. Rhythm varies but synonym churn ("blooming withering" thrice) drags propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck world with responsive garden and cracked-marble ritual transforms tropes into organic proof; risk in garden agency heightens stakes. Villager's conversion feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
