<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic's interior contradiction shines in the transcription compulsion despite rational doubt, with embodied fracture ("gasping on the stone floor, the tile warm") earning her final reconfiguration; micro-choices like opening her mind reveal values hierarchy with conceptual cost of fractured worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density builds pattern of kinship, tightening to Charged Poise closure where whale's reply reconfigures skepticism with felt cost in Elara's bones; orientation anchored early in tower/whales; visions as taught shards pay off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jade tile as micro-setting constrains transcription choice and charges final heart-held image; sensory hierarchy (salt wind, low songs, dissolving walls) reflects skeptic's perceptual shift, evolving with events to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rational isolation vs. vast connection deepens accumulatively through entangled visions, forcing agency in repeated transcriptions and silent outreach; cost legible in mind's fracture and urgent reflection need, charging final pause/reply under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal kinship emerges organically from particulars like Anya's song/rope and whale's guidance, with final call as non-literal resonant answer reweighting human blindness; ambiguity lingers in "terrifying truth" without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature shifting from rational grasp to entangled blood-weave; rhythmic prose modulates intensity (short gasps to expansive symphony), purposeful lyric compression taught early in whale songs pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in peak visions ("world softened; the tower walls seemed to dissolve"); minor figurative density in climax ("double-exposed," "unheard symphony") purposeful without muddle, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic+jade magic square+whale entanglement transforms tropes via specific kinship tapestry; risk in nonlinear memories heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at tile's reprise guiding courageous kindness.</comment>
