<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to restore balance drives forging and installation with embodied clarity ("searing reverie"), earning incremental absolution; interiority particular but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from fracture discovery to inscribed blueprint and installation; closure as Charged Poise in perfect swing reconfigures chaos to balance with felt cost of lifelong service legible in final glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and tides constrain forging (tempering water) and installation (pendulum pause), charging final arc-cutting swing; sensory details (slick stone, dusty air) filter through winder's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of balance restoration tightens via inscription discovery and forging cadence, narrowing to pause-install with agency; cost felt in despair-to-glow shift but one tightening limits to 8s under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges organically from treatise-inscriptions and rhythmic forging, resonating in final image of oscillation forgiving failures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (ticks/tocks, gear-train life); rhythmic diction modulates from searing to warm glow, reflecting mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure ("clean, golden arc"); figurative density purposeful in accumulative lyricism without muddle or loops, though elevated diction borders overwriting in forging beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rake-handle inscriptions as philosophical blueprint transform clock-repair trope into meditation on equilibrium; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
