<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory logic-sentiment impulses act simultaneously as she maps crystal to starlings and pours raw memory into flame, earning final harmony with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from crystal observation through starling mapping to silent pulse; resonant reconfiguration lands on-page as mist-tree transformation reweighting obsession with unification cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Waterfall rainbows and flock prism constrain flame-crystal choice by channeling light; recurrent silver tree charges final blooming image.</comment>
