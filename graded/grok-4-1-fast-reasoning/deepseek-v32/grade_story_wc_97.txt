<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied longing ("fingers moved... with steely longing") and micro-choices (noticing flicker, following compass), earning the final resolve; minor abstractness in "strategically creative" traits slightly dilutes contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with motivated ellipsis (film flicker → corridor → compass → shaft); on-page DC closure in clock toss and step ("unplanned encore had begun") with legible fear/hope cost; orientation anchored early in station/arbor setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (compass detects magnetic tides, shaft draft sighs); final shaft image charged by prior porthole twilight; selective sensory vividness (ozone/grease, dripping passageways) filters through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant escape stake tightens causally via discoveries narrowing options (useless compass reveals drain); agency in toss/step forecloses staying with felt fear cost; one decisive escalation sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of scripted fate vs. surprise emerges organically from clue-chasing particulars; final chime/reprise reweights clock motif without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (strategically noticing overlooked flickers); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in final breath; no dialogue, clean free indirect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("steely longing... ironclad hope") during peak but purposeful; no loops, clear syntax supports causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-station magnetic tides and clue objects (film reel, compass, clock) transforms escape trope; risk-taking in hidden guts descent inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes.</comment>
