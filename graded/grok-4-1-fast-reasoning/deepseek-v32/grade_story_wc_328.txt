<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris's motivation rooted in mentor's loss drives confession and transformation with embodied contradiction (envy of moths' change); final guardianship earned via prior bitterness. Elara's knowing eyes apply light pressure without dominating. Minor therapy-speak in "turn bitterness into cosmic joke" self-awareness slightly unearned mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from garden whispers to static confessions to metamorphosis; RR closure in arrowhead embedding and choice to stay, with legible cost of dissolved old self in "bitterness dissolved into awe." Orientation anchored early in underground garden post-Missing Return. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi and gravitationally playful field constrain transformation (she rises, suspended); POV filters via Aris's unstable hopes mirroring gravity. Sensory hierarchy sharpens to prickling skin and warm arrowhead in climax. Final image charges with moths' wings reflecting light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bitterness to cosmic joke) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via self-confession deepening to metamorphosis narrowing options; agency in pressing phone to ear forecloses return to surface research. Cost felt in "frostbitten hope...bloomed into warm certainty." One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of untamed harmony emerges via confessions channeling garden's essence, reweighting bitterness in cosmic laugh image without statement. Subtext in moths as guardians enriches complexity. Resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cosmic perspective shift); diction modulates from unstable hopes to awe ("universe laughing"). Elara's dialogue natural, subtextual ("roots are speaking"). Minor filter-verb stacks early but not under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with sentence length in transformation (short prickled/bones, longer cosmic shift); high density in static-to-tone progression. Minor paraphrase loop in "static-laden confessions on the old cordless phone" repeat dulls slightly, not touching closure. No heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid metamorphosis via antique phone confessions in gravity-warped garden; transforms undercover trope into personal guardianship. Risky cosmic joke payoff inevitable from arrowhead cue. No derivative echoes.</comment>
