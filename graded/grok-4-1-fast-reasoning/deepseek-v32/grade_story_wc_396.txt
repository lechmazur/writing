<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's calmly intuitive attribute and motivation to map empathy onto action drive consistent micro-choices, like mirror visits and final projection, with interior contradiction in believing impossible restoration. Final choice earned by accumulated glimpses, foreclosing enforcement-only path with relational cost. Blind spots in shared fears create genuine struggle resolved on cliff's edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: glimpses build density to CR closure where fragment glows, projecting visions during "weighted breath before reply," reweighting harmony premise with conceptual cost of shared fears. One tightening via final cheval glass insight narrows to actionable empathy. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring fragment and mirrors constrain choices, charging final projection image; orchard-ice floes pressure cliff-edge standoff. Sensory details (grinding floes, warm fragment) selective via Elara's intuition, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clear across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmony restoration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mirror glimpses to final vision tightening options toward joint mission. Agency in persistent visits and projection forecloses violence with felt crowd silence. Cost legible in "potential for violence" crystallized at edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges organically from shared fear visions, resonant CR in projection reweighting prior glimpses without moralizing. Final image of subsiding ice offers non-literal answer to discord question, embracing complexity of hidden loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: intuitive filtering of tensions as "coming storm." Voice texture lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm for glimpses vs. climax poise; purposeful compression in mirror shards legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, syntax supports intuition (e.g., "shadow-lace about her seemed less a mark of burden"). Minor figurative density in descriptions fits fantasy pattern, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image. Zero artifacts in peak projection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirrors-as-empathy puzzle transforms restoration trope, with courageous anomaly risking impossible act. Mirror method and final heart-reconstitution risk heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
