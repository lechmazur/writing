<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through advisor guidance to confession; interior conflict embodied in memory surge at clasp-to-photo moment. Final change earned via unbosoming with felt cost of cowardice exposure. Lacks stronger contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations and images builds to RR closure via confession evicting fear, cost legible in shame voiced aloud and clasp sealing luminance. Orientation anchored early in funhouse entry. Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (dust, old rain, pulsing green light) selectively filter through Leo's priorities, mirroring decay and fear; funhouse constrains path to central photo. Recurring luminance and cursed photos charge final image as tears weep and malice fades.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear's weakness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening memories and photo confrontation narrowing to confession agency; cost unmistakable in voiced shame foreclosing haunted stasis. One tightening sufficient at length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of fear as evictable via honesty emerges organically from paradox note and confession payoff, resonant in clasp repricing as redemption token. Minor thematic echo in final lines ("fear could be tricked, but only by honesty") borders summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward cursed images and advisor whispers; rhythmic texture modulates from repulsive allure to clarity at end. Advisor materialization clean, voice distinct as subconscious rustle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("repulsive allure," "lingering luminance," "photographically cursed," "unbosom") create paraphrase churn across beats, dulling density; end summary redundantly cycles closure concepts. Rhythm varies but overwriting in descriptive runs obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of funhouse surrealism with dream dictionary paradoxes transforms haunted trope; clasp's evolution from deceit symbol to redemption vessel feels inevitable. Risky surreal advisor payoff heightens without gimmick.</comment>
