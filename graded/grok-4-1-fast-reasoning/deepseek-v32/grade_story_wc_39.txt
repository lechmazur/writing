<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation as translator roots choices like jar-capturing and honey-dripping, with embodied wistfulness in "tenderly attuned to loss"; shift from collector to composer feels earned via music box payoff, but lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jar collection to music box discovery/unlocking to jar choir; closure as Charged Poise in "jars sang back" reconfigures wandering to purpose with conceptual cost of committed listening; orientation anchored early in loft/dunes/dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Feral loft constrains digging and jars glow in final image, charging closure; sensory details like "wind hissed a perfect A" filter through Arlo's sound-attuned POV; purposeful selection mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete ancestral sound) signaled early, tightens via box's shanty under accumulative lens; agency in sweetening gears forecloses incomplete collection with felt cost of prior "dictionary without its most vital word"; no reversal but decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges from jar/melody synthesis, resonant in final "preserved time" image reweighting loss to purpose; subtext in "sweeten the rust" implies redemption without moralizing; complexity lingers in solitude's acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in sound idioms like "dawn's earliest whistle"; rhythmic prose modulates wistfully to triumphant; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked figures like "salt-crusted cube... clouded like a blind eye" risks muddle without harming closure; no loops, clear syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-jars and honey-sweetened box transforms preservation trope; risk in poetic compression pays off in "sandy cathedral" closure; feels inevitable from early method.</comment>
