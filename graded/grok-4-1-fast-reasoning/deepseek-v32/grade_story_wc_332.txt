<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to capture the dream roots consistently in childhood longing, intensifying through glyph fragments to compel the cliffside shift from photography to painting. Interiority feels embodied in breath held during shots and dew-mixed light. Final renunciation earns from prior accumulation, foreclosing possession with felt cost in the fading cipher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: glyph fragments build density to map the final isle, culminating in CR where the dream reconfigures as memory. Orientation anchors Elara/archipelago/dusk shifts early. Cost legible in "symbols shimmering with temporary life" and still whispers, reweighting the stake without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering tides and dawn spears constrain vantage choices across islands, charging the cliff palette act. Sensory hierarchy (light over sound hush) reflects Elara's priorities. Palette as micro-setting filters light, mirroring internal absence in final dew-paint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream capture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glyph map narrowing to west isle. Agency in repeated sunrises and cliff renunciation forecloses photo-possession path. Cost felt in temporary shimmer versus permanent weave into hush; coherent pressure to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of light-holding connections emerges from palette fragments and grandmother memory, reweighting "luminous absence" in cliff painting. Final image resonates non-literally, embracing ambiguity of inhabited moment over possession. No moralizing; complexity in dream's shift from place to presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biases to light fractures and whispers. Rhythm modulates from journey hush to thrum pulse, supporting accumulative density. Purposeful compression of repetitions teaches pattern, legible at glyph payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives (light as liquid fire) taught early, propelling to closure without loops. Varied syntax breathes with dawn builds; no scaffolds dull peak cliff image. Minor register elevation fits librarian's poetic lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-cipher via light-painting transforms trope into glyph-map quest. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; cliff dew-act inevitable from palette priors. No derivative echoes; bold hush-frame commits fully.</comment>
