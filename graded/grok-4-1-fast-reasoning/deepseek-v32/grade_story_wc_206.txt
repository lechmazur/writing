<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in reclaiming light intensifies through honest whispers and realization about midnight, compelling the final tethering choice; embodied in fingers winding the box. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, mostly competent execution without blind spots compounding struggle. Final endurance of truthful repair earns closure but lacks deeper internal micro-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic density builds from notes weaving fractures to lattice around midnight's presence, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as chip dissolves into light with cost (sacrifice of chip, rust's prior decay). Orientation anchored early in chamber and twilight. No causality breaks; every adjustment narrows to balance restoration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonance chamber's amplification constrains choices via sound-shaping reality, charging final throb and dawn burst; music box as micro-setting tool handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (ticks, chimes, whirrs) selective to Arlo's priorities, integrated into action. Vivid, purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim light via covenant mend) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as whispers recede rust but fail, deepening to tether midnight with agency in pin adjustments and truth spoken. One reversal (presence coalesces) narrows options; cost legible in chip's flare/dissolution charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honest mending (light not stolen but misunderstood) emerges organically from covenant's response to truths and midnight's reconfigured role, resonant in final "harmony settled" without moralizing. Particulars like rust receding reweight premise; ambiguity in "mending what wasn't torn" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in sonic bias ("crystalline notes," "tinkersong wonder"); rhythmic diction modulates from winding tension to rising chord. Clean free indirect style; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice texture distinct, prose-like whispers natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "first notes spun out... sought fractures"); varied rhythm supports propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in peak metaphors ("lattice of sound," "thousand points") risks figurative density but stays coherent, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic metaphysics, honesty-wilting rust, and midnight-as-balance transforms tropes organically; risk in abstract repair paid off by concrete music box mechanics. Inevitable hindsight from early "mending what wasn't torn" to final dawn; no derivatives.</comment>
