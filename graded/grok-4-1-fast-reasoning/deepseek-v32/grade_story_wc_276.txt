<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cool-headed trait embodied via transliterated emotions on spike ("steady purpose" to "feral hope"), driving micro-choices like zigzag and voiced silence under pressure. Final capture earns motivation fulfillment with visible endurance cost against feral vines. Minor slip: minimal internal contradiction limits depth to competence over raw struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks accumulate density to lake eruption (DC closure via voiced silence freeing echo). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening at chaos symphony narrows to core reveal. Cost legible in spike thrust and garden backlash weathered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden specifics (basswood trees, audible light lake) constrain zigzag paths and silence-parting, charging final web dissolution. Sensory hierarchy sonic/tactile under POV urgency; constellations' dreamlight evolves causally with chaos. Body/spike as micro-setting anchors feral threats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch echo) signaled early; textural escalation peaks at lake symphony collision, forcing spike thrust and silence agency. Coherent pressure narrows to harmonized capture; cost in predatory rhythms dodged, garden soothed post-success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of creation via broken patterns/silence emerges via echo capture reweighting chaos to stasis, without moralizing. Final jar image offers non-literal resonance on harmony's predatory calm. Particulars (spike script, voiced void) ground subtext organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sonic-biased perceptual signature (stuttering chords, glowing script); rhythmic modulation accelerates in chaos ("notes colliding and birthing"). Prose texture distinct, eliding backstory for present propulsion; no withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (e.g., "hollow quiet with his lips" propels); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor figurative density in garden descriptions purposeful under textural lens, but slight muddle in "predatory calm, a melody that promised rest while hiding claws" edges overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sonic garden, emotion-spike, silence-voicing transforms fisher trope into cosmic harmony quest. Risky conceit (transliterated resolve enabling thrust) heightens stakes inevitably; no template echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
