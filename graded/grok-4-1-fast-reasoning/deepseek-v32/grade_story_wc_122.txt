<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defeat numbness roots consistently in grief and drives micro-choices like signing her request and placing hands on the horn. Embodied emotions peak convincingly in "Tears, warm and sudden, traced her cheeks." Minor abstraction in early "frozen spirit" keeps it from 9+ as impulses feel more sequential than simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibrations build density to filament revelation; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with legible emotional cost in tears and thaw. Single scene anchors orientation early ("drum maker's cavern"). One tightening suffices via backward song deepening stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cavern's damp stone and horn constrain choices, charging final image as Elara removes hands. Sensory hierarchy favors touch ("topography of tremors"), mirroring internal thaw. Leaves skittering frame entry/exit purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early, tightens via backward vibrations narrowing to filament under Accumulative lens. Agency in hands-on endurance forecloses numbness path with tear-cost legible. No micro-turn needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hush-within-sound emerges organically from vibrations to "silent song that would never break," reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image resonates as non-literal answer, charging prior muted world. No Thematic Echo; ambiguity lingers in peace's texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in vibration metaphors; voice modulates lyrically to match intensity. No dialogue to judge; elision of sounds purposeful and taught early. Rhythmic control holds under climax pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "hush" pattern; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("cascade of inverted rhythms") during peak but coherent, no loops dulling closure. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Backward phonograph in drum cavern transforms silence trope into tactile ingenuity, synthesizing deafness/music fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; premise commits fully without retreat. Final hush reclamation inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
