<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the drip moment, where theatrical narration yields to raw truth, earning the closure choice of embracing imperfection with visible cost in warped bookmark and altered craft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through ice groans to CR closure; cost legible in "let it be warped, let it be changed," reconfiguring perfection path with the bookmark drip image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drip from melting ice constrains pivotal choice, charging final glass teardrop image; sensory details (breath visible, pings, groans) selectively mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe zones vs. memory thaw) deepens via drip reversal, forcing agency in meltwater use; cost unmistakable as prior frozen narrative foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thawing heart motif shifts from disaster to liberation through glass heart image, offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting inquiry premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in glassblower's thermal/breath motifs; rhythmic modulation from dramatic narration to raw truth under pressure, stable close-3rd POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density (e.g., "cathedral of silence") purposeful but slightly elevated early, not touching closure drip beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glassblower crafting psychic orbs amid Arctic thaw transforms isolation trope via thawing heart synthesis; risk in lyric narration heightens stakes organically.</comment>
