<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Characters defined by labels like "guardian of truths" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; Leo's motivation told repetitively but not intensified via scene conflict; Eliza's arc summarized, lacking internal struggle or visible cost in pivotal meeting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern of prophetic fortunes building to Eliza's joining as Charged Poise RR; orientation anchored early in lighthouse specs scene; vignette chaining lacks one meaningful tightening, with closure cost oblique in "bound them to the island" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lighthouse and rocky island provide consistent atmosphere mirroring enigma, with storm aiding mood; sensory selection purposeful but sparse; setting guides isolation without constraining specific choices, as in Eliza's unpressured arrival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No dominant stake escalation under Accumulative lens; abstract "transpose lives" lacks on-page reversal or trade-off; Eliza's fear confrontation summarized without agency or cost legibility, leaving pressure static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of secrets reshaping lives emerges organically from fortune examples but undermined by direct tells like "open secrets in whispers"; final lighthouse image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers but lacks counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with perceptual bias toward mystery, but diction repetitive ("orchestrating," "transpose"); no dialogue to test; voice modulates lightly with accumulating examples but lacks distinct texture under peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops with verbatim repeats like "after last orders" (8+ times) and "transpose life into a new key" (5+); template cadence in summary sentences dulls propulsion; artifacts obscure closure image despite pattern attempt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune writer-spy in lighthouse transforms gossip trope via microdots and prophetic quirk; risk in repetitive enigma motif heightens conceptual stakes; no close famous echoes.</comment>
