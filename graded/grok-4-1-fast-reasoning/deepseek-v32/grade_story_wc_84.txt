<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kiran's yearning and rootless pull embody motivation, intensifying to compel renunciation with felt cost in bone-resonance softening his expression. Contradictory impulses act in the final choice against employer. Perpetually surprised trait reveals under glitch but doesn't constrain deeply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via trails → lever → pedestal to Charged Poise closure: leaves chip pulsing, cost in betraying employer and claiming search as home legible in final starry exit. Single scene causality tight, orientation anchored early. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory constrains via lever/plinth/pedestal slot, charging luminescent web final image; dusk's violet/copper/indigo evolves with activation. Sensory filter sharp-eyed, purposeful. Body/tool (drone/console) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode for employer vs. personal belonging) deepens via deliberate omissions → physical ritual, agency in pull/insert/renounce foreclosing delivery path. Cost unmistakable in new motivation. Lens escalation coherent via density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Belonging emerges from ritual fragments, not chip; final resonance reweights premise without moralizing, countering weaponization via invitation image. Particulars (wind/chant/hall) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (glitches surprise, sharp drone-eye); rhythmic texture lyrical-sci-fi modulates to quiet recognition. No dialogue. Elision of employer details pays off in choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via image-embedded action; rhythm varies, no loops though "brilliant dimness"/"perpetually surprised" recur purposefully. Minor overwriting in "forensic poetry" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: analog chip + star trails + sonic homeworld frequency transforms sci-fi tropes into ritual belonging; risk in poetic data-forensics heightens stakes organically to inevitable stasis.</comment>
