<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between blind obedience and intentional evolution act in the decoding and humming; final creator's calm earned by plant-guided causality with felt weight of choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensation buildup from plant whispers to sonic unseal; CR closure lands on-page in embryo's question reweighting destiny, cost legible in "immense weight and lightness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hot springs constrain unseal (submerge in hottest part, hum into gurgle) and charge final image of steaming reminder; sensory hierarchy via telepathic algae/lichen mirrors POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unseal tightens via decoded surge forcing hum; agency in submerging/humming drives Accumulative escalation to CR, cost unmistakable in collective question foreclosing blind path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chosen destiny emerges from particulars like dissolving amber; final kite tail flutter offers resonant non-literal reweighting of premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in plant sensations ("murmurs of moss," "root-memories"); rhythmic control modulates from deliberate ache to symphony under pressure, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("amber melting away into the water as if it were mere sugar"); no loops, varied rhythm supports Accumulative cadence to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants, sonic kite script, embryo catalyst transforms tradition trope; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes via conceptual cost of choice.</comment>
