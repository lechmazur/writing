<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo’s contradictory impulses—reciting facts as “thin armor” while feeling the scrap’s “rough fabric”—act simultaneously in scene, earning the final purpose shift with vulnerability cost. Minor diagnostic label-speak (“confidently uncertain”) slightly abstracts peak interiority without embodied payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories breaks insulation pattern, tightening to writing beat that reconfigures purpose; Charged Poise closure (“scrap rested in his pocket, a touchstone”) lands with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors early (“dim quarry office trailer”); single-shard scope fits defaults, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Trailer’s “grimy window” to “stark rock faces” mirrors “hollowed-out spirit,” constraining isolation; scrap as micro-setting handled tactilely, charging final image. Sensory selection POV-biased (antiques facts, fabric texture) integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) signaled early, escalates via Accum lens density (facts → memories → writing), narrowing to renunciation of insulation with vulnerability cost legible in “facts gave way to feelings.” Agency drives one meaningful tightening; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of wresting purpose from remnants emerges organically via scrap’s shift from relic to “touchstone,” reweighting loss without moralizing. Final shop setup offers resonant non-literal answer; minor Thematic Echo in repeated “echo valley longing” slightly overtells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (factual recitations blending antiques/roadie idioms); rhythmic modulation builds from muttered facts to flowing realization prose. No dialogue; purposeful compression of reflections legible under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops (“wrest” thrice, insulation motif) and synonym churn (“echo valley longing” repeated) dull mid-section density without pattern payoff; template stems (“He [action]”) in reflection beats trigger −0.6. Rhythm propels overall, closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Niche roadie-appraiser synthesis transforms tropes via scrap’s evolution from loss relic to purpose catalyst; fresh “echo valley” tone and quarry-music blend feel inevitable. Risk of reflective mode pays off in charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
