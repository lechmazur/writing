<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to thread own story from father's lies drives consistent ascent and confession; internal conflict between disbelief legacy and truth-seeking yields earned stasis at lattice placement. Embodied emotion surfaces tactilely in warming lattice, but some abstract phrasing dilutes peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ascent densifies patterns to CR closure: lattice maps labyrinth, reconfiguring lies into sustaining truth with acceptance cost in "permanent dusk." Orientation anchors early (son, lighthouse prison, dusk); one continuous scene fits scope, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (salt whispers, defying shadows, scuff marks) filters through POV legacy bias, constraining path via narrow door and beam. Final room charges CR image, with beam sustaining impossibilities mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chase hush before bodies found) escalates accumulatively via deepening realizations and time mantra narrowing to pinnacle confession; agency in placing lattice forecloses escape with felt legacy cost. Single tightening via lattice glow suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stories sustaining impossibilities emerges organically from father's relic to son's weaving, with CR final image ("his story now sustained the impossibilities") resonantly reweighting lies into truth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (legacy-tinged metaphors like "wolves were real"); rhythmic poetic compression suits accumulative lens, modulating from uncertainty to hush. No dialogue; voice holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("before they find the bodies," "lattice from confessional," "thread the labyrinth") create paraphrase churn across beats, dulling propulsion despite rhythmic intent. Density strong elsewhere, but artifacts cap high-band eligibility; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh fable inversion (cried-wolf son chases hush in impossible prison) synthesizes myth with lighthouse spiral organically; CR turn feels inevitable from established relic patterns.</comment>
