<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction via serene anger fueling precise observation amid fury at time's elusiveness; final choice to disappear earned by prior micro-choices like leaning into ink. Minor label-speak ("consciously wild") feels slightly unearned without more embodied tradeoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ink patterns building to CR closure—insight demands personal disappearance, cost legible in "he too would soon disappear"; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment constrains observation (flat rock for journal) and charges final image ("wind howled...carving new shapes"); sensory hierarchy sharpens via tracker POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover time dilation) deepens accumulatively as patterns pulse into labyrinth, forcing realization with tradeoff cost (personal vanishing); agency in focused observation tightens options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of expanded consciousness in crisis emerges organically from ink's ephemeral patterns mirroring survival dilation; final image reweights premise non-literally as Kael embraces "ephemeral patterns...that only he could see."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biased toward temporal shifts (e.g., "seconds stretched into minutes") stable in close third; rhythmic modulation fits accumulative texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (drone's "wings hummed softly"); minor figurative density in ink climax purposeful and pattern-taught, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink-simulated time dilation and self-disappearance transforms trope of epiphany into conceptual cost; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes via irreplaceable drone/ink logic.</comment>
