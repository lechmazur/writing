<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to protect memory drives consistent micro-choices like planting the seed and chanting tales, with luminous doubt as a persistent internal conflict embodied in her "hopeful yet uncertain glow." Final endurance of doubt forecloses tidy resolution with felt cost. Minor abstraction in emotions like "luminous doubt" repeated without deeper contradiction slightly limits peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dream interpretation to ritual pulsing blooms to tree growth, culminating in on-page RR (memories anchored in tree loop as rain falls, "blooms retained their clarity"). Cost legible in "luminous doubt remained, a soft question." Orientation anchored early ("ancient ridge...monsoon clouds"); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridge blooms and pre-monsoon scents constrain ritual timing and charge final image ("drenched...watching the glowing tree" under rain). Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-filtered (petal "shimmered with faint, recalled laughter"); details evolve causally (blooms pulse, light flows into tree). Micro-setting (soft earth, highest point) guides planting choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save memories from rain) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density in ritual/tree growth narrowing options before storm. Agency in channeling memory culminates in fruit consumption forcing stance crystallization. Cost felt in doubt persisting post-success; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragile memory preservation emerges organically from ritual events, reweighted in final image (tree "humming within...sustained flowers," doubt as "reminder that memory...is always unfolding"). Subtext in whimsical methods vs. empirical duty avoids moralizing. Resonance from particulars like fruit visions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (whimsical observation: "empirically whimsical energy"); diction/rhythm modulate (whisper weaves to visions flood). Prose texture distinct: lyrical syntax reflects Elara's intuitive leaps. No head-hopping; elision of dream details purposeful, paid in ritual.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "seed...grew as Elara spoke, branching...under the sun"). Minor repetition ("luminous doubt") and dense figurative in peak ritual (-0.4), but purposeful/voice-motivated; rhythm varies, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fantasy premise transformed via specific reality-checker role, seed-dream ritual, and whimsical empiricism yielding tree library. Final reconfiguration (ridge "wakened...beneath the storm") feels inevitable from particulars. Risk in abstract tone heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
