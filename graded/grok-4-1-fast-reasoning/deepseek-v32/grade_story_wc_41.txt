<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Precognitively forgetful trait shown concretely through marking driftwood to counter slipping visions; contradictory clinging and fading impulses act in futile chalk etching; final acceptance of ephemerality earned with embodied cost in chalk dust taste.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds visions/markers/sound to CR closure; fog spire/home shift and dissipating sound reprice quest as moment not place; cost legible in "some things are only real in the seeking."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog sculptures constrain by shifting/erasing marks, mirroring lapse; damp earth and bleached driftwood tactile, charging paths; childhood home form in fog ties to videotape hush for closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to capture sound signaled early, tightens via heard sigh then dissipation/revelation as self; agency in arranging/marking forces trade-off acceptance; cost felt in broken chalk and unraveling insight under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impermanence theme emerges via fading marks/visions, resolved non-literally in "to become it"; echoes motif reweights without moralizing; final chalk dust image answers quest obliquely with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias to ephemeral shapes/sounds character-specific; rhythm modulates from tidal pull to granular sigh; purposeful compression teaches pattern paid in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, motifs like "echoes" purposeful not looped; rhythm varies read-aloud, no scaffold in peak sound/hearing beat; minor descriptive overlap contained, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Sound of growing older" as rustle/sigh fresh angle on aging; precognitive forgetfulness transforms prophecy trope; lyric risk in fog/textural build heightens stakes organically to CR.</comment>
