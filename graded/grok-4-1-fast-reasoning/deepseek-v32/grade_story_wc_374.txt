<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism vs. luminous hope shows contradictory impulses in embodied taste-sensing and glow; final acceptance earned via ring guidance and figure encounter. Minor label-speak in "luminous skeptic" opening slightly genericizes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure: Elara's realization reconfigures worldview with skepticism's conceptual cost legible in "calm climate of acceptance." Orientation anchored early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender bluff under aurora vividly sensory (crushed scents, taste shifts), constraining path to overlook and charging final image of peace amid dissipating mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn weather's origin) tightens via ring vibration and ozone-to-sweetness shifts forcing figure confrontation; cost in skepticism's foreclosure felt in brightened glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of emotional weather emerges via sensory motifs but figure's "forests vote to remember" dialogue articulates thesis too directly, reducing subtext at pivotal revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with taste-perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates build but sparse dialogue lacks strong subtext. Capped per Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Heavy repetition of "terrestrially cosmic" (8+ instances) creates artifact loop dulling closure image; ending paraphrase churn (multiple internalization recaps) drags propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taste-weather sensing, sentient forests, and personal climates transforms sci-fi tropes into organic cosmic-personal convergence.</comment>
