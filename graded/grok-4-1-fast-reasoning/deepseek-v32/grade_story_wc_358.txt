<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to cultivate foresight drives micro-choices like anemometer tracking and climbing, culminating in an earned shift to "mapping the echo" with conceptual cost of unbelievability. Interiority particularized in embodied sensations (grit stinging eyes, hum in teeth) and contradictory calm amid chaos. Final realization reveals hierarchy of values without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wind data, patch, vantage geometry accumulate density to CR closure where "physics had folded," reweighting premise with cost of no believable report. Orientation anchored early (Aris surveying port post-silence). Single tightening via core descent suffices; lens unambiguous at ending image of sighing breeze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth constrains routes and wind funnel, charging vantage revelation and core hum. Sensory hierarchy via investigator bias: eddies defy calm, vacuum alley, patch pristine amid grime. Final breeze evolves causally, mirroring reconfiguration; micro-setting (containers inward-facing) indispensable to geometry payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel vanishing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via adapting wind confounding survey, patch anomaly, shear-force insight narrowing to singularity. Agency in persistent documentation forecloses causal explanation with felt cost ("no report that could be believed"). One deepening reweights knowledge under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of convergence emerges organically from accumulating facets (wind, silence, patch), answered non-literally by final "new normal" image reweighting foresight as eternal vigilance. Patch reprise shifts from clue to benchmark, charging CR without moralizing. Complexity in physics' fold embraces ambiguity over resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: wind "learning routes," "narrative tightening." Prose texture modulates rhythm to pressure (short investigative bursts, elongating realization). Diction hazy-precise ("hazy precision," "dreadful, precise picture") reflects focalizer without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayer (e.g., "pressure, a hum felt in the teeth more than heard" advances sense, stakes, closure). No loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (air "stitching wound," physics "folded"). Rhythm varies propulsively, closure image crisp without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: man-made wind funnel births singularity, psychic silence as aftershock, transforming accident investigation trope. Risky CR closure ("some convergences leave only questions shaped like answers") inevitable from particulars, heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
