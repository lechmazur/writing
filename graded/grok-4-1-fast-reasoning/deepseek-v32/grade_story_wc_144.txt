<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's blindness enables unique perception via sound and touch, rooting her motivation in restoration; micro-choices like positioning the lens reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat, idealizing competence without deeper flaw-cost tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repair process builds density through sensory patterns to Charged Poise closure in final activation and ship hum. Orientation anchored early (shop, depot, blind artisan); cost legible in "personal punctuation" tying her progress to departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist softens light for refraction method, constraining diagnosis; depot sounds (anchor chain) evolve with action, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (blind focus on sound/texture) filters vividly without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode drone for ship) tightens via crack discovery and patch under anchor's building rhythm; agency in methodical choices forecloses failure path. One decisive deepening suffices, with felt precision cost as chain clanks louder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mending through alternate sight emerges from refraction repair and blind calm; final drone chimes reweight premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like undistorted rainbow answering initial distortion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable blind POV with perceptual signature (warmth patterns, harmonics); voice modulates rhythmically with process intensity. Leo's brief report distinct via sound-judged confidence; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sense, sound propulsion; varied rhythm breathes with beats, no loops. Minor repetition of "magnetic calm" purposeful for tone; closure image clear without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious blind refraction diagnosis transforms repair trope; world synthesis (steam depot, drone for ship) feels organic. Risk in water-light method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
