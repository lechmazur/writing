<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in bruised awe, shown concretely via puppet mirroring her face; interiority particular through patterns and hush. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure: clock hands dissolving into starlight reweights time as ocean-shore with conceptual cost of erasure. Orientation anchored first paragraph; lens holds cleanly to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pane of hush and puppet as micro-settings constrain perception/work and charge final crumbling image. Sensory hush palpable, selective via POV; lighthouse glow evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lullaby end) tightens accumulatively via converging patterns; agency in tracing connections forecloses frantic ticking with puppet's dust as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of flawed beauty/cycles emerges via puppet-face mirror to final convergence; CR ending reweights doomsday as blessing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (nested patterns, hush lens); rhythmic diction modulates serene build to peak glow, purposeful without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax; figurative layers (galaxies dance) purposeful in pattern-taught mode, no loops/artifacts dulling closure crumble.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday as lullaby via puppet-key transforms trope organically; risk in lyric hush/ripple heightens cosmic stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
