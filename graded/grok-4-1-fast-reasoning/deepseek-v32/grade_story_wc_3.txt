<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between methodical patience and haunted urgency act simultaneously in planting the seed and documenting growth, earning the final softening into grateful comprehension with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of observations and plant stages builds to on-page CR closure—"some transitions are a form of completion"—with resonant silence as undeniable conceptual cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's iron vines and charged soil constrain planting choice at central node and charge final palm-on-plant hum, filtering through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding transition deepens via plant's spiral growth and bloom under agency of tending/documentation, reweighting with felt cost of ambition's softening in bloom detachment mirroring Anshar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition as release emerges organically from seed-to-light and spirit parallels, with final hand-on-plant offering resonant non-literal repricing that reweights analogies without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature of analogical patterns; rhythmic modulation heightens bloom watch—"breathless, as the light brightened"—without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from seed-turning to bloom pulse; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures, clarity peaks in closure image of "resonant silence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform sky-arbor, magnetic seed-tree echoing spirit physics transforms loss tropes into inevitable CR, with bold world logic heightening stakes risk-free.</comment>
