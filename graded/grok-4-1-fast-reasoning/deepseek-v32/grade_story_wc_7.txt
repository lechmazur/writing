<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's gift of tasting memories is embodied through concrete sensory actions like foraging greens, driving her internal pruning of bitter memories at climax. Contradictory impulses surface in reshaping neural pathways from despair to resilience. Minor label-speak ("informally wise") slightly abstracts traits without full tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (tasting history, pruning) causally links to celestial peak and CR closure via fruit's wisdom, with legible cost in memory pruning ("leaving only the lesson of resilience"). Orientation anchors early (greenhouse, alignment hours away). Single continuous scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains choices (overgrowth to prune, soil for seed, broken panes for starlight), charging final vibrant vision. Sensory details (creaking iron, tasted optimism/decay) filter through POV's tasting gift, mirroring internal shift from ruin to renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture beauty from ruins via seed) signaled early, tightens via internal pruning that forecloses despair with felt neural cost. Agency in pruning/planting drives Accumulative escalation to fruit's awakening. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-climax prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion emerges organically from nurturing acts, culminating in non-literal CR ("vision of its future, vibrant and alive") reweighting ruins without moralizing. Interconnectedness via tasted understandings invites ambiguity on progress vs. nurture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (tasting rewires brain) biases noticing toward memories/senses. Prose texture modulates rhythm from reflective to urgent at alignment ("strange light filtered"). No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "snipped and cleared" weaves setting/character); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops in reflection ("prune... pruning") and repetitive "tasted" stems slightly drag mid-section without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic chef gift, magic seed, and ruin-rebirth transforms tropes via synaptic pruning climax. Risky Accumulative celestial growth feels inevitable, heightening stakes through irreplaceable tasting mechanics.</comment>
