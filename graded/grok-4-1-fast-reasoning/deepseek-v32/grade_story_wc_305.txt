<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong embodiment in tree-climbing and scalloping actions reveals kindly decisive trait under reflective pressure; interiority concrete via garden tending paralleling self-care. Minor slip in unearned epiphany smoothness at "Contentment arose from acceptance," bordering therapy-speak without embodied contradiction. Final vow earns change via prior causality, but lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tree perch to scalloping to pool reflection, culminating in CR closure via hairpin-charged realization reweighting forgiveness. Orientation anchored early in grotto details. Cost legible in final image of hairpin against temple, foreclosing restless seeking with acceptance's quiet price. Single tightening via artifact find suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (silver bark, luminous moss, diffused beams) filter through caretaker bias, mirroring renewal theme. Grotto's elevation constrains climb and path work, charging tree perch moment. Recurring pool reflection evolves to charge final peace image. Spatial choreography coherent in single-scene window.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment source) signaled early post-forgiveness; accumulative tightening via hairpin recall and scalloping cadence narrows to internal crystallization. Agency in meditative choices forecloses external quest with felt emotional cost. Pressure coheres quietly without reversal overload; cost unmistakable in vow's self-nurture turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rebirth theme emerges organically from garden cycle, hairpin continuity, and forgiveness arc, reweighted non-literally in final tending insight. Subtext in artifact's hum layers ambiguity without sermonizing. Resonant reconfiguration ties protagonist arc to question, lingering via hairpin image. No Thematic Echo despite close calls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in nature-inflected noticing (e.g., "vineyard hush"). Rhythmic modulation builds meditative texture; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure poise. No head-hopping or withhold; diction biased to caretaker lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., scalloping advances plot and theme); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops on "cycle of rebirth" and "forgiveness" across reflections dull momentum slightly (−0.4). No closure-touching artifacts; figurative language purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud-grotto setting with rebirth cycle transforms forgiveness trope into garden-tending metaphor. Hairpin's tarnished memory hum offers non-obvious inflection on continuity. Bold poetic tone risks lyricism but coheres without gimmick.</comment>
