<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Singular motivation drives all actions consistently, rooted in frost study and press ritual. Interiority concrete but sparse, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under peak strain at rupture. Final achievement feels earned via prior setup without deeper flaw-complicated micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost pattern guides press adjustment, whisper destabilizes, rupture compresses eternity into sheet for RR closure. Orientation anchored early in library/workshop; legible cost in Aeliana's strain and expended vial. Single scene causality tightens meaningfully once at activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass orchard and frost patterns constrain choices (guide typeset) and charge final shelf image. Sensory vividness (thrum, crackle, glow) selective via Aeliana's priorities, integrated into action. Evolving environment (shelves hum, clouds calm) mirrors reconfiguration without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compress eternity) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density: uncork falters gears, activation ruptures reality, strain narrows to inward pull. Agency in micro-choices forecloses precision path with embodied cost; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection awakening truth emerges organically from destabilization-embracing rupture and new library order. Final sheet image reweights premise non-literally, with conceptual cost in negotiated reality's settlement. No moralizing; ambiguity in future patterns lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with lyrical perceptual signature (frost vortices, silver mist pulses). Voice modulates rhythmically from anticipatory to intense at rupture, diction purposeful and biased. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; syntax varies for ear (short cracks at press, flowing descriptions pre-climax). Minor overwriting in metaphors (cosmic sigh) during setup but purposeful and non-muddled at peak; no loops, scaffold, or filter stacks dull closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass orchard, frost oracles, and whisper-destabilization transforms ritual trope into inevitable reconfiguration. Risky fantasy compression feels organic and hindsight-earned; irreplaceable particulars like vial mechanics heighten stakes without gimmick.</comment>
