<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlo's acoustic perception and grandmother's echoed tradition compel the dive and violin note with embodied resolve, earning the unbinding choice; solo POV yields pure interior drive without relational slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stifled echoes build to frail rhythm → desperate hum → matching tone shivers water and breaks seal (on-page RR closure with dive risk cost); orientation anchors early in bay/shipwrecks/greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse dome and corroded pipe constrain listening/dive, charging bubble eruption and final watery song; sensory hush (drips, creaks) mirrors internal echoes selectively via Arlo's ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind trapped song) signaled early via bowl, tightens accumulatively to violin tone forcing hatch groan/release; agency in perceptive matching forecloses fruitless silence with cold-water dive cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Beauty-in-unfinished emerges implicitly from stifled echoes to liberated chorus, reweighting hush with counterpoint in final fire/music image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third-person acoustic signature ("memory of sound in the hollows") biases perception consistently; rhythmic prose modulates from hush density to release without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("water around the glass dome began to shiver"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (tapestry/symphony) through peak seal-break.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound-vibration unbinding of drowned orchard transforms post-fire silence trope organically; violin-as-unbinder synthesis feels inevitable from acoustic core.</comment>
