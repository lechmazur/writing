<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies credibly through embodied actions like pressing the shard to her forehead, earning the climax vow to live amends; contradictory impulses surface in holding letters versus acknowledging their weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of songs, messages, and visions builds to Charged Poise closure—"Elara chose to transform the apology into action"—with felt cost of unspoken words foreclosed; orientation anchored in first line, single scene coherent.</comment>
