<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in heat-map chaos (grief blues to awe amber) compel the pivot to integrate conservatory emotions, earning the final attunement with trauma's persistent cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from solo emotion fail to integrated gold resonance; closure as Charged Poise reconfigures silence via visual symphony with emotional cost legible in "soul attuned."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unshaken Marvel and winterglass constrain heat-projection choice and charge final blooming image, with frost/prism details selectively mirroring internal rectification under silence's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rectify dissonance for music) tightens via failed solo map forcing integration, protagonist agency drives under accumulative lens; cost felt in emotional chaos yielding to gold wash at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of heart-hearing emerges organically from tuning fork shimmer to ice-flower chime; final image resonant reconfiguration answers silence-translation without moral, reweighting Capsize void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (silent gestures, thermal whispers) modulates rhythmically to peak vibration; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short awe breaths to cascading prisms); zero loops/artifacts, figurative control peaks cleanly in "harmonic resonance emerged... visual symphony."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of silent post-Capsize world, emotion-heat to inaudible forks, and visual music transforms survival trope; risk in abstract mechanics heightens stakes organically to inevitable shimmer.</comment>
