<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in engineering curiosity evolving to aspirational repurposing, shown via sextant use as wrench and notes on "poetry of failed movement." Interiority concrete and embodied in "stoic wonder." Minor flaw: idealized competence lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from survey to fountain resurrection as Charged Poise RR with legible conceptual cost in "leap of faith" and cohering maze. Orientation anchored immediately. Closure image of stars falling upward reconfigures dereliction with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "dusty carnival stalls" and "conduit lines" constrain choices (rerouting) and charge final atrium image. Sensory hierarchy via engineering POV sharpens conduits over decor. Dome constellations mirror internal aspiration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for hope) signaled early; accumulative tightening via sextant find and rerouting narrows to climactic switch with agency-driven deepening. Felt cost in risked failure of "leap" alters options, charging poise. Stakes conceptual but viscerally embodied in hum and eruption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope as "direction" emerges organically from maze cohering via light arcs, reweighting premise in final image without statement. Subtext in sextant reprise and caretaker nod invites ambiguity on shared endeavor. Resonant non-literal answer: stars "fall upward, forever."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: engineering filters yield "latent energy" notices. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating to terse climax ("She threw the final switch"). Rhythm breathes with scene urgency; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "tarnished, intricate brass arc" advances plot/atmosphere). Rhythm varies; minor figurative density in opening ("ghost-lights") purposeful for textural lens. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civil engineer repurposes carnival projectors into holographic hope in derelict spaceport transforms tropes. Risky lyric voice heightens conceptual stakes. Final caretaker nod adds non-obvious relational inflection.</comment>
