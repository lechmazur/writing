<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's patient strategy shines in chained micro-choices like hooking the chain for mallet reach, aligning actions with motive to plant resilience. Interiority concrete via embodied strain and observation, no stock phrases. Minor lack of contradictory impulses limits to strong but not exceptional; competence dominates without deep flaws complicating peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: wall fall therefore chain break therefore decode therefore vault access, culminating in arrow throw DC with sparks as legible cost. Orientation anchors instantly in carnival center. Single scene tightens meaningfully via automaton approach; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like skee-ball lanes, piano bench keys, and frozen rabbit constrain choices (mallet drag, wiring short). Carnival decay mirrors resilience theme, charging final dust image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency; body/tool as micro-setting shapes tactics perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed access amid patrols) signals early, escalates causally via short-circuit window narrowing options before final automaton. Agency in decoding/impeding shows trade-offs; cost felt in stealth risk. One tightening sufficient, but no moral calculus sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from seeds/chains/dust, reweighted in final image without moralizing. Particulars like crow-feather arrow shift from key to weapon. Ambiguity lingers in "staggering grace"; invites reflection via strategic endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: strategic scanning of routes/objects. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, rhythm modulates from measured drags to swift whirring. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action ("fingers brushed the cold handle"); rhythm varies for tension. Minor figurative density ("dust motes danced like forgotten tokens") purposeful, no loops/artifacts dulling closure. "Staggering grace" reprise clean, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: piano keys as vault code in carnival vault heist transforms tropes via strategic decoding/throw. Risky post-apoc grace tone heightens stakes; irreplaceable arrow evolution inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
