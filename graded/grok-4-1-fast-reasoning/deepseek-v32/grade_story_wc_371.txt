<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as noticer drives concrete micro-choices like tending seedlings and offering the roll, earning the closure stance; Aris tests her character causally; official's softening reveals status shift under pressure without headcount blur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: daily gifts build pattern to official's arrival as cadence shift; Charged Poise closure ("He left without filing... clutching a second roll") lands on-page with tenuous cost legible in final image; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Overgrown tea house and garden constrain choices (gap entry, oven vent for herbs) and charge final image (snowdrops, rosemary as proof); sensory selection (wisteria, flour, steam) POV-biased to sacred ordinary; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving continuity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bread gifts to official confrontation; agency in offering roll forecloses report path with felt relational cost; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tenuous absolution emerges from particulars (tending, baking, roll) without statement; final image reconfigures sacred ordinary with lingering ambiguity (tenuous/real as seedling); no moralizing, counter-readings plausible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing decay/light); dialogue sparse, subtextual ("You didn't trample"), distinct (Aris dry leaves vs. Elara gentle); rhythmic modulation under stress clean.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences at climax); no loops/artifacts; minor repetition ("tenuous," "heuristically gentle") voice-motivated without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening/baking against creeping normality transforms tropes organically; risk in quiet resistance pays off at official's charged softening; no derivative templates.</comment>
