<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses in storm-mirrored rage/peace; final writing choice earned via prior scar mappings. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("furiously tranquil") avoids deeper penalty as it anchors state without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections/timer builds to CR closure in "single, pristine line" with cost of transformed rage legible in final calm. Orientation anchored early; one tightening at timer ring suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stormlit dome/telescope constrains solitude and charges reflection in lightning flare; selective sensory hierarchy (lightning pulses, timer tick) mirrors internal scars without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar cartography) signaled early, tightens via timer countdown/storm zenith forcing mask-slip agency; cost felt in renunciation of "dense, angry verses."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-channels emerges organically from map/life parallels and final line; resonant CR reweights silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("bruise-dark bellies," storm-kissed diction) stable in single 3rd POV; rhythm modulates with intensity, elisions purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; minor paraphrase loops ("furious tranquility," scar motifs) purposeful in lyric accumulative mode but dull minor beats. No closure artifacts; rhythm varies effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of darkroom relic/envelope summons transforming censorship epiphany; storm scars as personal map feels inevitable, risks bold lyric compression.</comment>
