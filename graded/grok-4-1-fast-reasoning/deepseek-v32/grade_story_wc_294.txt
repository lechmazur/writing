<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Leo's polished calm is embodied in steady voice and perceptive reading of Ben's "eager folly," driving dissuasion choices with internal contradiction between inheritance and escape. Ben applies crucible pressure as mirror, forcing revelation. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "perceptively calm" at pivotal tour, but climax choice earned without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via markers/money tour to pattern break in Ben's reflection. Orientation anchored early (train, satchel). Closure as Charged Poise in Leo's "observing the circle, not chasing it," reconfiguring paths with conceptual cost of accepted cycles legible in final lantern glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Train's rusting cars, flaking elephants, and overgrown tracks constrain sanctuary and shape dissuasion via markers. Sensory hierarchy (twilight bleeding rails) reflects Leo's dusky harmony. Markers as micro-setting charge climax revelation, mirroring internal cycles without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissuade Ben from cycles) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through tour showing money/markers, narrowing Ben's ambition. Leo's agency in revelation forecloses Ben's path with felt cost in cooled eyes. Trade-off visible: Leo spares mirror at personal isolation's price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of circular paths emerges organically from money, markers, train. Final image of sorting bills recharges prior inheritance without literal moral. Minor echo slip in Leo's direct "polished calm comes not from control, but from accepting the cycles," softening resonance at tour climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Leo's perceptual bias (reading tones like roads). Dialogue goal-driven: Ben's rapid scheme vs. Leo's steady warning advances subtext. Voice rhythmic, modulating to dusky poise; distinct idioms (Ben frantic, Leo serene).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but paraphrase loops in "polished calm," "dusky harmony," "territorial markers," and "circle back" across beats dull propulsion (−0.8 total). No closure touch; vivid images like "twilight bled into the rails" propel. Minor template cadence in reflective stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: robber's markers repurposed for train sanctuary, money as circular inheritance ties startup fall organically. Risk in reflective stasis heightens thematic cycles without gimmick. Transformation of tropes (failed heir, prodigal return) via perceptual calm feels inevitable.</comment>
