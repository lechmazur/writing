<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in clairvoyance gap haunt her pilgrimage, embodied in "unseen forces brushing against her skin"; contradictory impulses peak when merging forces forecloses foresight reliance with felt cost of embracing now.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density of music/shadows builds to CR closure ("time folded through shadows and music") with conceptual cost of released prophecy; single scene anchors orientation immediately, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (melodic hum, ozone scent, dancing shadows) constrains choices like focusing on shadows to inhabit forces; recurring crystal formations charge final path-parting image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify magic amid foresight gap) escalates via textural deepening (swirling vortex, present visions); agency in inhabiting crystallizes stance, cost legible in "release her need for foresight."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unpredictable now over linear foresight emerges organically from particulars like dewdrop visions; resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on magic's gaps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (clairvoyant bias toward unseen); rhythmic prose modulates from bewilderment to harmony, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful pattern in "overlapping shadows" repetitions builds texture without loops; minor paraphrase in music descriptions (-0.2) doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clairvoyance irony and "bright darkness" harmony transforms mystic tropes; risk in textural CR closure feels inevitable from cave's logic.</comment>
