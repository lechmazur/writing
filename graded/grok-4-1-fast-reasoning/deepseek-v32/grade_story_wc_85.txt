<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (guilt as "cold stone," numb fingers tracing glyphs); final acceptance earned via causal build from profession's irony to paternal revelation. Contradictory impulses act in scene: forging fictions professionally yet desperately sifting for truth. Minor slip in reflective summary ("guilt was a cold stone") borders therapy-speak but anchors present quest without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: density of shore sifting and carving discovery reconfigures knowledge, leading to Elara confrontation. Closure as CR on final page—"weight of a withheld truth was precisely equal to the burden of love"—with legible emotional cost in "heavy, mournful acceptance." Shards transition legibly; carving moment tightens options decisively. Orientation anchored by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" and "desolate curve of gray sand and slick stone" constrain sifting choice and mirror internal void, narrowing to glyph discovery. Final terrace reprise charges closure image under dusk motif. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (genealogist notices deliberate cuts amid natural scratches). No white-room; spatial choreography coherent across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quell gnawing uncertainty) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via despair at shore then carving tightening that forces Elara trace. Agency in self-devised method and black-market skills forecloses false-memory life with acceptance cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in final clasp of watch hand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: withheld truth's weight reweighted as love's burden via watch hand's evolution from broken token to "testament." Final image—"watch hand clasped tight"—answers central question non-literally, recharging shore hush and profession parody. Subtext in tempered regret avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in fragile peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: shadow-bloodline diction ("trafficker in bloodlines") biases noticing (glyphs over scratches). Voice rhythm modulates—lyric hush builds to thudding heart under pressure. Elara's whisper natural, subtext-laden ("He carried the guilt for both of you"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: sentences multilayered (e.g., "wind carried a sieved hush... pressurized quiet" advances setting/atmosphere/stakes). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in sifting to revelation; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Opening figurative cluster ("staining his hands... cold stone") pattern-taught as voice, propels without opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Driftwood-code messages transform genealogy trope into tactile quest; watch hand's birth-token synthesis feels inevitable, heightening stakes via fear-shaped love. Premise fresh: false memories contrast real withheld paternity. Risky lyric accumulative structure coheres without gimmick.</comment>
