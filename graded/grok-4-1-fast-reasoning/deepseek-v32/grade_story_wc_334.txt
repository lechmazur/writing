<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chronic curiosity embodied in persistent search despite cold water; micro-choices like mapping reveal values with cost of immersion. Interior contradiction in breaking avoidance habit yields earned recovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure; imperfect ring discovery tightens pattern recognition, cost legible in "habits break" reconfiguration yielding peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and ship masts constrain mapping choice, charge final image; sensory details (brackish water, bioluminescent glow) filtered through folklorist bias mirror fractures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ring find forcing interpretive deepening; agency in tracing lines yields emotional cost in resurfaced pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fractured patterns hiding truths emerges organically; final "whole sight" offers resonant CR reweighting guardians and displacement without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with folklorist perceptual signature in detail-noting; rhythmic prose modulates immersion, diction evokes ethereal curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sense, realization; varied rhythm propels without loops, metaphors like "tiny moon" support tone coherently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore cipher via shipwrecks and mushrooms transforms tropes; broken constellations pattern feels inevitable, risks surreal setting payoff.</comment>
