<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's vigilant motivation roots in grandfather's tales and intensifies to compel publishing and gathering; embodied reactions like breath catch reveal character under pressure, but lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from photo trail to narrative mosaic, landing CR closure in gathering's reconfiguration of history with stewardship cost legible in final calm; orientation anchors early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridgeway and mudflats constrain patrol and descent, sensory selectivity (glint, sinking boots) mirrors unease; recurring hush/mirror charges final image, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim defiant history signaled in unease, deepens via final photo forcing publication choice; weeks' labor and gathering vulnerability yield felt cost charging poise under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reclaimed voices emerge organically from artifacts and descendants' reactions, not statement; final toast reweights sanitized narrative with resonant ambiguity in shared hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (violets mirroring water, fading notes) biases toward memory; stable close-third POV, diction/rhythm modulate from patrol tension to calm poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via purposeful motif like "mirrored hush"; minor overwriting in flourishes ("grim unveiling") and "precisely humane" reprise slightly dulls but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Trail of photos offers fresh inflection on submerged town trope, synthesizing drought, artifacts, and communal toast into inevitable CR; risk in lyric hush pattern heightens stakes organically.</comment>
