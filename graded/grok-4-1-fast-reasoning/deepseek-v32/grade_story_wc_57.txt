<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's infinite patience shown through sustained decoding embodies motivation rooted in preservation, earning the weavers' trust with micro-choices like tracing knots; interiority concrete in tactile focus. Minor flaw: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, mostly serene endurance without tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot density builds to revelation with final crown knot as tightening; Charged Poise closure ("legacy now entrusted") reconfigures stakes with patience's felt cost legible in "hours might have passed, but time felt suspended."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rope and fulgurite constrain decoding choice, fog/rope evolve causally to charge final image of shared knots; sensory hierarchy (tactile twists, chilled hand) mirrors patient quest without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax lore) signaled early, textural escalation via knot revelations narrows to final technique with agency in patient decoding; cost visible in endured cold/time, though lacks sharper trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Preservation theme emerges organically from decoding as "tactile scripture" to entrusted secrets, resonant non-literal answer in warming seed pod reweighting loss-to-promise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in philosophical noticing ("each knot a language"); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("A gift... forged by heaven's fire"); stable close-3rd POV, rhythmic modulation suits lyric hush.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (varying lengths build hush), no loops/scaffold; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("woven secrets," "oceanic hush") slightly muddles peak density without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knot-decoding lore and fulgurite offering transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric patience pay-off feels inevitable, heightened by rope's irreplaceable script.</comment>
