<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies convincingly from vague longing to precise action via dreams, compelling the journey and adjustments; interiority embodied in "inner ear" and frozen hands reveals particular traits under pressure. Final change earned by causal buildup, with exhaustion as felt cost. Minor epiphanic summary in grandfather memory slightly abstracts, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through star tracings to pattern break at reversal, delivering on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (stars flow upward, creativity restored) with legible cost in "profound and necessary exhaustion." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via orrery's autonomous spin narrows to closure. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orrery as micro-setting constrains choices (gears aligned to stars) and charges final image ("warm, gently ticking"); aurora archway supplies falling stars that evolve with events. Sensory details selective (cold fire, metallic hum) mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Environment shapes tactics throughout climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regain creativity via mapping) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through star density and orrery response, forcing deepening realization; agency in instinctive adjustments forecloses inaction path. Cost unmistakable in exhaustion post-flare. Minor abstractness in initial stake declaration, but pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rekindled stardust emerges organically from particulars (grandfather memory during alignment, stars reversing), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance from conflicted beauty ("perfect and terrible") lingers plausibly. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of trapped creativity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature ("unspoken words," cosmic synesthesia); rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical peak at reversal. Purposeful compression in dream shards taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; cosmic metaphors consistent and pattern-taught, varying rhythm supports escalation. Minor overwriting in opening nebula/paint swirl cluster risks density dip, but no loops, scaffolds, or muddle touch closure image. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dreamer mythos with orrery-stardust mechanics transforms tropes; reversal turn inevitable from established pattern. Bold risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to cosmic premise fully.</comment>
