<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "tremor ran through her, not of fear, but of certainty," rooting aesthetic drive in sensory fusion; motivation intensifies consistently to compel boundary-striding choices. Mild contradiction in impulses (sensed but undared method) acts in scene without full crisis layering. Idealized certainty smooths flaws, but change feels earned with prior sensory buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from approach to internal hum-blending, culminating in CR closure ("found not blasphemy, but revelation") with conceptual cost of prior confinement legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (poet enters atrium by lake). Single tightening via touch-to-fusion suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake vividly integrated, mirroring internal dissolution ("slow crack of ice, a boundary dissolving") to charge closure image; quartz constrains choices (touch, move between pillars, sit center). Sensory hierarchy aesthetic/POV-specific (hum paraphrases wind). Selective, purposeful—no white-room or checklists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boundary-striding fusion post-ban) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hum intensification ("harmonizing with her heartbeat") narrowing to participatory transformation. Agency in micro-choices (touch, speak, sit); cost felt in foreclosed silence. Quiet pressure coheres without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges organically from hum-fusion and ice-crack image, reweighting premise in non-literal CR ending ("all boundaries are permeable"). No moralizing; complexity in blasphemy-to-revelation shift lingers. Protagonist arc inextricable from fluidity of beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (ephemeral beauty in "clouds and shadows," hum-to-language); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity. Prose texture poetic/controlled, syntax mirrors dissolution. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; "paraphrasing" motif purposeful without loop excess. Minor paraphrase redundancy ("dissolving boundaries") in mid-section, but no closure-dulling artifacts or overwriting in peak (sitting/envelopment). Clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-ban aesthetic ritual in humming quartz fusion transforms trope of silenced art into fluid revelation; cloud-shadow poet and lantern-moth hush feel particular/memorable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes organically. No template echoes.</comment>
