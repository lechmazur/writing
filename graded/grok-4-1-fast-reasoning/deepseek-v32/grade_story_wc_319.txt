<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete, embodied homesickness sharpening into a blade upon touching the pendant; contradictory duty and feral instincts compel the archiving choice with visible cost to prior order. Final acceptance of chaos as datum forecloses rigid boundaries, earned by micro-choices. Minor abstract phrasing in epiphany ("friend to the mist") lacks full embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure: pendant interiorized reconfigures garden and mindset, cost legible in softened light gradients and reframed homesickness. One tightening via visions during grasp narrows options from rejection to acceptance. Orientation anchored early in frozen garden; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (pooled light boundaries constrain movement, mist as medium) evolves causally with pendant, mirroring internal shift and charging final image of blended horizons. Micro-setting of frosted twig and root bench grounds feral navigation. Body/attention to pendant's weight integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesickness vs. order) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pendant's warp forcing stance crystallization in interiorizing act; agency in cataloging forecloses destruction path with garden-altering cost. Escalation driven by her choice under lens, pressure coherent to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from particulars: rigid light pools yield to gradients post-pendant, reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image ("dreamed, wide awake") offers resonant CR answer, charging prior homesickness as filed datum. Invites ambiguity on vigil's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: foggy-lucid diction filters setting through guardian bias (ice branches as facts, petals as pages). Rhythmic control modulates from stark boundaries to blending mist; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture or shift, syntax varies for foggy rhythm. Minor synonym churn on "mist"/"fog" and "frozen" repeats purposeful but borders template feel; no loops obscure closure image of labeled shelf homesickness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral archivist in ice library transforms tropes via dimensional fold and interiorizing method; pendant's cult-key twist grows from pattern, risk in lyric accrual heightens stakes to conceptual horizons without gimmick.</comment>
