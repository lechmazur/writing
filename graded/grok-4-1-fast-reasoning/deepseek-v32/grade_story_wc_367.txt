<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in laughter preceding storm and micro-choices like prism adjustments under rising wind; shadowed elation shows contradictory joy/sorrow acting in ritual. Final endurance of routine earned by past sorrow's weight. Minor label-speak in "shadowed elation" slightly genericizes peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine to storm peak via vibration/wind/light, cadence shifts to ebbing gale and reemerging stars. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in "buried reef emerging" and "new day forming from turmoil," with conceptual cost of past unsaved ships legible in final descent. Orientation anchored immediately in lighthouse climb; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse's pulsing stone and prisms constrain steering choices; glass wick as micro-setting charges final cooling image. Sensory details (slapping wind, crackling lightning) selective via Kael's priorities, mirroring internal storm. Final beam on waves evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steer storm for renewal) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vibration to peak fury, narrowing to subtle prism tweaks; agency in alignments forces trade-offs with visible cost in "sorrow of all the ships he could not save." Reef emergence tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-renewal emerges organically from light-steered patterns and prophetic leaks; final "gentler light" image offers non-literal answer to using shadows for dawn, reweighting prior turmoil without moralizing. Shadowed elation subtext layers complexity via past cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in prophetic hums and storm-as-dance noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from sharp laughter to quiet satisfaction. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early fits accumulative lens payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("shadowed elation," "ancient shadows," "total internal reflection" x3) creates paraphrase loops dulling peak momentum; some overwriting in "bittersweet peal" and "guiding blade" mixes metaphors without pattern payoff. Strong propulsion overall, but artifacts cap high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse optics (TIR steering storm) transforms trope into otherworldly renewal premise; risk-taking in light-as-storm-herald heightens stakes inevitably. No derivative echoes; particular details like fused silica wick feel organic and irreplaceable.</comment>
