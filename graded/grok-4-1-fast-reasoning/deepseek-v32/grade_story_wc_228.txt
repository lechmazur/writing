<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied nostalgia and aloof detachment shown in solo quest and detached painting passion; internal conflict in seeking truth while knowing transience; minor slip in "intimately aloof" more labeled than complicating closure choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: placing shell back as tide rises ("the entrance would soon be submerged") reconfigures permanence premise with undeniable cost of leaving the moment; orientation anchored early, one tightening via shell discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave's bioluminescent glow, still pool, and rising tide constrain choices (wading, hasty exit) and charge final image; painter's eye filters details purposefully, like "thrashing kelp" half-concealing entrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fulfill promise deepens accumulatively via shell to painting ephemeral reflection; agency in choosing not to paint shell but its impermanent light, with cost in numb fingers and submerging tide; one tightening forecloses permanence path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transient beauty emerges organically from shell's nostalgia, pool's reflection, and final painting; resonant CR ending image ("echo of eternity") non-literally answers promise without moralizing, reweighting prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Painterly perceptual signature in details like "muted gray of the evening sea" and "light lived for just a second on the water's skin"; stable close third-person limited with rhythmic modulation; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor overwriting in repeated "temporary eternity" motif and elevated phrasing like "sacred interlude" slightly dulls peak revelation beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism in self-painted quay shell transforming painter's nostalgia trope; risk in lyric accumulative closure pays off with inevitable hindsight reconfiguration of promise.</comment>
