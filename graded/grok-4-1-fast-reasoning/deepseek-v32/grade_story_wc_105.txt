<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via synesthetic perception of flames ("violet for sorrow, cyan for longing") and embodied personal betrayal memory fueling the imprint, earning final hope detection; contradictory pain/hope impulses act in testing beat with visible flinch cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory/process density builds to on-page closure test ("delicate, devastating chime that made her flinch"), reconfiguring pain into repair undercurrent with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored early in sunken greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via knee-deep brine/sealed gear and charges closure (orchard resilience mirrors hope undercurrent); selective synesthetic sensory filter (shipwreck groans as bass, saline fruits) reflects Elara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imprint trust-breaking sound) tightens accumulatively through absence synthesis and forge work, forcing test with flinch cost; agency in precise thermal shifts narrows to Charged Poise reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory's fractures/healing emerges organically from absences/orchard regrowth, resonating in final undercurrent of repair without moralizing; reweights premise via test chime's hope note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("heard the colors of the flames") and rhythmic lyric modulation under process pressure; purposeful elision of dialogue fits solitary craft scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong density/propulsion with varied rhythm, but patterned loops ("cells divided" x4, "impact of memories"/absences paraphrases across 3+ beats) dull mid-section momentum without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia-as-craft, trust sound via absences, shipwreck orchard forge transforms tropes into inevitable closure; risk-taking in surreal logic heightens stakes organically.</comment>
