<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris's motivation rooted in chimeric fracture drives consistent micro-choices like following the illogical map; interiority embodied in memory overlays like the winking carousel horse. Final acceptance under the tree earns change via prior causal buildup. Minor diagnostic phrasing in "psychically fractured" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perceptual density builds to Conceptual Repricing at the silver tree, where capsules reweight fractured self with aching acceptance cost (emerald swatch farewell). Orientation anchored early in foggy bay/ship. One tightening via map-led journey suffices; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory progression from rust/antiseptic to spectral glow filters through Aris's bias, constraining path (duct crawl) and charging closure image (thinning fog/open sea). Carousel memory overlay mirrors internal fraying purposefully. Environment/body (trembling hands) shapes final choice without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover unified self via Garden) signaled early, tightens texturally as memories overwrite decay toward tree realization. Agency in narrative pursuit forecloses fractured premise with felt cost in acceptance/renunciation. No reversals needed; pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant unity emerges organically from name capsules and swatch reprise, resisting tidy morals via "aching acceptance." Final image (swatch at tree base) offers non-literal resonant answer without statement. Minor overtness in "not a curse, but unique condition" borders thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (reality/memory shifts) biases noticing distinctively; rhythmic prose modulates from exploratory to crystallizing poise at tree. No head-hopping or elision debt; voice texture purposeful in surreal overlays like blurred mirror figure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies with scene urgency, peaking in terse capsule fall. No figurative muddle or register drift; opening anchors stakes poetically. Minor overwriting in "narrative threads" phrasing but purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chimeric self/carnival garden transforms surreal tropes via grounded memory mechanics and aberrant unity payoff. Risky nonlinear perception heightens stakes; tree capsules feel inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
