<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in honoring histories drives perceptual choices, embodied in soul-anchors and painful backstory learning. Interiority concrete via focus-softening and intuitive gaze. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal painting beat, smoothing success without scene tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perceptual discoveries build density to ritual closure. Orientation anchored early in market. Conceptual Repricing lands on-page as threshold opens and gilded script appears, with felt cost of "forever translating" in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (ozone/old roses, dizzying height) filters through Elara's perceptual bias, constraining voice in market opening. Fragment as micro-setting charges ritual by lancing beam. Environment subtly mirrors internal clarity amid fog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (acquire lens for histories) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via unfastening painting to ritual. Agency in perceptual softening narrows options. Cost legible in ongoing bridge-role, but low opposition smooths escalation without reversal testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges via shifting images (golden map to gilded script). Final image reweights overlooked whispers into "luminous chord," non-literal answer to honoring without moralizing. Resonance from perceptual particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in softened focus and soul-anchors. Prose texture rhythmic, modulating intensity in ritual beam. Silas dialogue natural/subtextual, pursuing revelation trade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery; rhythm varies without monotony. Purposeful lyric figurative (tide of honor) taught early, no loops or stacks dulling closure. Minor overwriting in market descriptors risks purple but supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh perceptual fantasy transforms tropes via hidden-map painting and intuition-anchors. Bold accumulative drive and voice synthesis feel inevitable, risking lyric density for resonant close without gimmickry.</comment>
