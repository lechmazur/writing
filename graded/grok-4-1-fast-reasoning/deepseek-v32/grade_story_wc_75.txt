<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to rescue arts compels escalating choices from lens exam to bread ritual; interiority particular via lens perception and dread embodiment. Historically oriented trait drives journal seek and tour vision with earned shift to responsibility. Final renunciation of dread feels causal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lens reveals honeycomb therefore journal, therefore artisans, therefore bread success and thaw DC. Orientation anchors early via grotto tour and freeze. Closure shatters ice with conceptual cost of lost arts nearly paid, persistent constraint of scent shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's ice constrains pool access and choices; waterfall roar and honey glow evolve causally, charging final image. Sensory filter (mist, hum, scent) POV-specific via historical lens. Micro-setting (pool, lens) reweights at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue arts/thaw hive) signaled early, tightens via failed concert reversal narrowing to bread agency. Escalation causal under lens; visible cost of silenced looms and dread paid in near-loss before shatter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of cultural continuity via living practice emerges implicitly from failed arts to bread scent success; final image reweights displacement with hope's sharp responsibility. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third with perceptual signature in green-tinted views and rosewater dread idiom; voice modulates rhythmically from dread to hum. Brief artisan dialogue natural, goal-driven. No head-hopping despite group scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, density high via multi-job lines; dread motif patterns without loop. Minor figurative density in peak ("cloying perfume") borders coherence slip but supports tone. Propulsion clear to shatter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lens-revealed honeycomb and bread-scent thaw transforms frozen utopia trope; risk in scent-as-culture logic heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight from heirloom setup.</comment>
