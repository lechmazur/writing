<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fierce protection vs. open collaboration) act in the scene when Elara asks Henry for help, earning the final surrender to trust with relational cost. Interiority concrete via dust-mote ritual and panic from Jasper's return. Henry's kindness applies secondary pressure without overwhelming. Minor epiphanic phrasing in final paragraphs doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from isolation to partnership, culminating in Charged Poise closure where meteorite becomes "keystone for a future symphony" with cost of isolation's surrender legible in open door image. Orientation anchored early in attic details. One tightening via Jasper's return disrupts routine and narrows options. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting constrains choices (paper piles block organization, forces descent for equipment) and skylight dust charges final image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory details selective (coo, muddy feathers, cool meteorite) filter through Elara's priorities. Atmosphere of "decaying paper and forgotten stories" tensions preservation theme without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance memory vs. life) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Jasper's disruption forcing collaboration, foreclosing isolation with felt relational cost in tentative partnership. Agency in reckless decision to transcribe chip narrows options. Pressure coheres without reversal overload; cost unmistakable in "small surrenders."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of echoes evolving through change emerges organically from meteorite project and dust metaphor, reweighting preservation in final image without moralizing. Subtext in shared silences with Henry invites ambiguity on trust. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question of stasis vs. growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (dust swirls as order from chaos). Prose texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven (Elara's cracking voice reveals disuse). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sentences advance via image integration (e.g., "shaft of light... dancing dust"). Minor overwriting in repeated "balance" motif and "blooming withering" slightly muddles peak density but doesn't obscure closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeons, meteorite "music of spheres," and paper trails transforms grief into reinvention; meteorite's arc from talisman to keystone feels inevitable. Bold poetic risks heighten stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; particular details anchor universals.</comment>
