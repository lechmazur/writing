<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices build to earned realization at stone circle, with motivation rooted in persistent defeat; minor deduction for slightly summative epiphany ("The meaning she sought clarified") lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak hum beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density crescendo to hum and silhouettes; on-page CR closure reconfigures rebellion via ancient frequency with conceptual cost of forsaking present tools, legible in final aria and gathering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bedrock circle and permacrete constrain discovery choices and charge final bay image with holoprojector; sensory selectivity (bare feet on humming rock) reflects stargazer POV perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of rebellion lull deepens accumulatively via glyph-to-circle progression, narrowing to biological transmitter with agency in hum; cost felt in reweighted tactics, charging silhouettes payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of planetary persistence emerges organically from hum merging past/future; final silhouettes and aria offer resonant non-literal answer to meaning in defeat without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with stargazer perceptual bias (celestial alignments in glyphs/stars); rhythmic diction modulates to intensity at "seismic chord," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure; minor overwriting in stacked figures ("pull the very stars into alignment") slightly muddles peak circle beat without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport enclosing ancient circle as biological transmitter transforms rebellion tropes; risk in lyric resonance heightens stakes inevitably at hum payoff.</comment>
