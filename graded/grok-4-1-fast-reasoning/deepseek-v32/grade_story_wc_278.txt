<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's guilt-rooted motivation intensifies through embodied visions of the winter night, compelling the tethering choice with clear internal contradiction between erasure and integration. Final realization integrates flaw without tidy epiphany, earning stasis via prior misreading. Blind spots compound authentically before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure) holds: letters → amber activation → tattooing linkages narrow options to tethering, yielding CR in "time snapped back into alignment" with felt cost of guilt's integration. Orientation anchored early in lab; no disorientation debt. Single scene coherent, closure reconfigures temporal echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lab's resonance chambers and worktable constrain tattooing; amber as micro-setting charges final image, pulsating warmly. Sensory hierarchy (sounds over visuals) reflects tattooist's bias, evolving with time-fold to mirror internal hush. Specificity pressures choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via firmware cries and cry revelation, forcing endurance in etching despite shadows. Agency in needle activation forecloses dissonance path; cost legible in "guilt hushed into a manageable memory."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sound/silence integration emerges via particulars like meteor hush shifting from cry to greeting; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in amber's stir invites ambiguity on erasure vs. endurance. Resonance from conflict, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; voice modulates rhythmically from humming banks to hush's poise. Compression in etching beats purposeful, legible under textural lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring time-fold urgency; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("celestial patterns onto silence") purposeful in lab voice, supports propulsion without muddle in peak etching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustical surrealism (tattooing echoes, amber cry) transforms tropes into organic stakes; time-fold intensification risks bold nonlinearity, heightening closure's hush inevitability.</comment>
