<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism clashes with her sternal "compass," driving embodied micro-choices like placing the shell on the cello; her arc from decoder to listener is earned through the vision's cost to her myth-busting identity. Internal conflict shows in contradictory impulses toward skepticism and sensation. Final renunciation of publication forecloses her old path with felt isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from low C to resonant hum and vision, culminating in CR closure where Elara reprices her premise (riddle as origin echo) with the cost of an unclosable door. Single scene, orientation anchored early in observatory. No lens ambiguity; persistent shell/cello constraint shapes the resonant payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's dust-moted silence and closed dome constrain the upward-pointing resonance; shell's pulsing paint and cello's spruce belly charge the climax. Ocean crash mirrors spiral at closure. Sensory details (vibrating air, glinting stars) filter through Elara's priorities, evolving with the hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early, tightens via sympathetic resonance that forces realization; agency in bowing cello forecloses skeptical decoding. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights options with sublime loneliness cost in final image. One deepening suffices, cost legible in shifted motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of binding mysteries emerges from shell-as-cradle vision and "truth between the notes"; final cello completion offers non-literal answer, reweighting skepticism without moralizing. Subtext in gloomy cheerfulness deepening charges closure. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in hum frequencies and sternal tugs; rhythmic prose modulates from analytical to visionary. No head-hopping; diction biased to sonic specificity. Experimental lyricism taught early, legible at vision payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sound/image (e.g., "low C vibrated the air... purer hum emerging"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor figurative density in vision purposeful, no loops or muddle touching closure. Strategic telling in reflection anchors present action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting via primordial comet-hum in shell/cello; transforms skepticism trope through origin vision and non-publication stance. Risky lyric resonance (whisper of closing pages) heightens closure without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from established sonic pattern.</comment>
