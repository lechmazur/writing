<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; smooth competence without struggle or micro-choices under pressure undermines pivotal anomaly response, reading as unearned serenity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure (acceptance of darkness in cycles with conceptual cost legible in "troubling serenity settled into peaceful acceptance"); anomaly void provides one meaningful pattern break tightening toward core.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nebula garden and gear constrain transit choices vividly (e.g., ionized petals cluster forces sonar adjustment); recurring petals/gas mirror internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early but escalation minimal under Accumulative lens; anomaly void complicates briefly without deepening pressure or foreclosing options with visible cost, deflating climax glide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of eternal cycles and light-sharing emerges organically from particulars; final image resonant reconfiguration reweights serenity without moralizing, though repetition dilutes subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature (sentimental cosmos-gazing) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation suits meditative tone without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("generational patterns," "quiet sigh of falling petals" repeated 7+ times each) and synonym churn create template cadence, obscuring propulsion; climax summary redundantly paraphrases resolution across final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi lyricism transforms nebula tropes via gear/sonar logic; risk in meditative stasis heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
