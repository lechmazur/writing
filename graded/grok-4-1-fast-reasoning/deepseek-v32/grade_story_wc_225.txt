<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied remorse ("remorse had coiled inside him like a trapped clock spring") and micro-choices like fidgeting into thread-pulling reveal chess-honed strategy under reflective pressure, earning the forgiveness beat; minor slip in archetypal exile setup slightly genericizes early motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation anchors Elian in frozen village by ~100 words; density builds from labyrinth sensing to tapestry decoding to mental navigation, landing RR closure ("I forgive you") with legible emotional cost as stasis breaks; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices—labyrinth as mind-map, tapestry threads vibrate with "woven hush"—charging final image where platinum dims and village breathes; sensory hush/thunder pulses purposefully mirror internal decoding without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early tightens accumulatively via tapestry insights narrowing regret options; agency in winnowing threads forces mental navigation trade-off, with cost felt in "accepting the losses"; no reversal overload needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of mending past emerges organically from thread-winnowing to soul-unraveling, resonant non-literal close ("His productive fidgets had stilled into steady hands") reweights arrogance thread without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (chess endgame analogies) and rhythmic modulation under insight pressure; no dialogue, but diction's poetic hush-texture ("woven hush trembled") stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., fidgeting reveals habit while advancing action); minor paraphrase loops in thunder mentions and synonym churn ("winnow" thrice) dull mid-section slightly but spare closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess exile in memory-village with labyrinth/tapestry as mind-puzzle transforms tropes; risk in accumulative hush-dissolution feels inevitable, heightening stakes via irreplaceable objects.</comment>
