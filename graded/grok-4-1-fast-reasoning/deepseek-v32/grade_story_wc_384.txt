<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in mercy-treason forging and patient atonement act simultaneously through decades of tracing; final blood-pricking choice earned by embodied regret, foreclosing escape with exhaustion cost. Interiority concrete and particular, no stock epiphanies. Flaws like shame drive inevitable endurance without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: slow density of tracing builds to droplet-triggered realization ("not a lock, but a circuit"), delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing where chain dissolves with legible exhaustion cost in final image. Single scene anchored early; one tightening suffices. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Groove-circuit and stalactite drops constrain pivotal choice, charging closure as marble drinks blood-ink; aurora's green pulse and pearl twilight evolution mirror internal unraveling through tactile action. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (calligrapher's grooves, thorn feel). Micro-setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant atonement stake signaled early, escalates via realization-deepening under Accumulative lens to blood-unlinking agency; forecloses incomplete regret path with exhaustion price legible in "thorn loose in his hand." One decisive intensification charges final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiving unfinished via unlinking emerges organically from forgery-backfire to reversal; final "chain dissolved into the unfinished state" offers resonant CR reweighting treason's premise without moralizing. Particulars like blood-groove drive ambiguity-embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (regret filters marble memory, sky promise); rhythmic prose modulates from patient fog to unraveling pulse without head-hopping. Texture luminous and controlled under endurance stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-task (e.g., "droplet fell... struck the center" advances time/stakes); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "marble began to drink" cohere without muddle. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thorn-as-eraser and groove-circuit synthesize atonement fresh angle on forgery trope; blood-unwriting turn inevitable from particulars, bold lyric risk heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick. Non-obvious moral calculus transforms treason.</comment>
