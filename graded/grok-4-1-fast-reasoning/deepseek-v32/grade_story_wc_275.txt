<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to weave continuity is embodied through concrete micro-choices like whispering to seeds and burying the scrap, earning her pacifist endurance. Contradictory impulses surface in feeling the outside chaos in her bones while tending plants. Slight label-speak in "senselessly perceptive" mildly abstracts a strong trait shown in root-grasping perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from tending to tremor, delivering Charged Poise closure: sheathing the knife amid shake reconfigures stability with felt outside cost. Orientation anchors early in dome farm post-tower. Single scene fits scope; tremor pattern break tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome contrasts dust chaos outside, constraining choices by enclosing sanctuary; roses and irrigation hose guide tactile actions. Scrap as micro-setting charges final burial image, mirroring transformation. Sensory filter (thirst in bones, petal dawn) biases through Elara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave continuity) signaled early, escalates texturally via reports/father memory to tremor cadence shift narrowing peace options. Agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses violence path with visible tremor cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to charged final sheathing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of growth over violence emerges organically from inculcating roses and scrap repurposing, resonating in final petals holding light. No moralizing; ambiguity in father's seed lingers. Final image non-literally answers chaos-weaving without thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: engraved quiet, senselessly perceptive noticing. Prose rhythm modulates to shorter tremor lines under stress. Elevated diction fits lyric voice without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density ("engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze" repeated across beats) overwrites high-pressure tremor without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion. Paraphrase loops (weaving/continuity motifs restated adjacently) create minor redundancy. Strong verbs and image density elsewhere support mid-high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of inculcating values in post-tower roses transforms pacifism trope via scrap's grounded repurposing. Fresh perceptual trait and dome sanctuary angle feel inevitable to closure. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
