<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in father's legacy compels precise choices like tracing grain and decoding codes; interiority concrete via embodied intuition under pressure. Final realization earned through cumulative micro-choices, foreclosing fear with felt emotional cost. Minor slip: smooth progression lacks sharp contradictory impulses in pivotal threshold step.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via decodings and intuitions to CR closure where "she realized that sacred thresholds were points of balance" reweights premise with conceptual cost of visible balances. Orientation anchored early on terrace; one tightening at threshold crossing rearranges maze but centers her. Persistent constraint of distances shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and wooden grains constrain choices (precise gaps, pattern prediction) and charge closure image of stabilized light. Sensory hierarchy reflects intuition bias: light gleams, wood whispers, cracks punctuate hush. Details evolve causally with drifts and rearrangements, mirroring internal growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover sacred why) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via grain/logbook alignments narrowing to threshold test. Agency in measured steps and decoding forces trade-off, with cost felt in maze sensitivity post-butterfly. Escalation coheres to Charged Poise where "forever changed" crystallizes options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds as convergence emerges organically from particulars like grain patterns and codes, reweighting butterfly chaos to hidden harmony without statement. Final image of "harmony restored" offers non-literal answer, lingering ambiguity in emotional distances. Resonance from flawed intuition confronting chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: biased noticing of grains, gleams, whispers as intuitive maps. Rhythmic prose modulates from hushed fragments to steady warmth, compression purposeful in lyric mode. No head-hopping; diction character-specific, poetic yet grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job via image-action-insight, rhythm varies (short cracks amid flowing realizations). Patterned repetition of "fractured hush" taught early, pays off in hum shift without loops obscuring closure. Minor paraphrase in grain decodings, but no artifacts dull peak threshold step.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze mutating via butterfly effect, navigated by pilot codes on wood grains into emotional distances. Risky lyric imagery (prism drifts, featherly resolve) heightens stakes organically, transforming tropes into inevitable CR. Non-obvious moral calculus on sacred chaos elevates beyond templates.</comment>
