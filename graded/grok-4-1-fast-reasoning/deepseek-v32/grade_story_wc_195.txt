<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exemplary arc from withdrawn isolation to integration, with contradictory warrior-dancer impulses embodied in "fingers, clumsy in their gauntlets, moved to unsnap"; final weeping reveals earned change with visible cost of shed armor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably, building density from program discovery to pattern-weaving; on-page RR closure via solidified light-tree and crumbling program lands with legible emotional cost in tears and discarded armor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard setting constrains pivotal pattern-dance in soil and charges final image of thriving trees; sensory details like "luminescent fruits hung like captured stars" filter through Caelan's mystical bias without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture possibility tightens accumulatively via pattern-deepening that forecloses rigid reality; agency peaks in allowing puppet strings, with cost unmistakably felt in "shiver of bliss" vibrating bones.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of releasing grips for possibility emerges organically from particulars like marionette image and unsnapping; resonant non-literal closure in "gardener of futures" reweights withdrawal's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature biases toward mystical geometries and lights; rhythmic prose modulates from vigilant tension to ecstatic poise, with clean single-POV distance enhancing charged final harmony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through patterns, but minor overwrite in repeated "shivering bliss" (3x) and "crystalline tomorrows" slightly dulls peak propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical puppetry and possibility-weaving transforms knight trope via irreplaceable pattern-dance; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at light-tree birth.</comment>
