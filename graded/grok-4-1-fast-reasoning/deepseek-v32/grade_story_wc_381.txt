<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to hush the prophecy compels persistent micro-choices like guiding the wing against resistance; embodied emotion in sensing the "dissonant vibration." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for deeper interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from wing placement to glow and dissolution; on-page closure as Resonant Reconfiguration when wing sinks "heavy with captured code," legible conceptual cost in dormancy. Orientation anchored early by brook and night; single continuous scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook and origami wing as micro-settings constrain ritual choices and charge final dissolution image. Sensory details like fireflies and rustling leaves selectively mirror hush progression through POV filter. Purposeful economy integrates all into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hush prophecy signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening silence and wing's glow against "resisting" essence, narrowing to completion. One tightening in collecting "fragmented code" forecloses chaos with felt persistence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of earthly silence over cosmic chaos emerges organically from ritual images; final brook flow as resonant non-literal answer reweights prophecy dormancy without moralizing. Particulars like ripples of "silenced sound" build complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature attuned to silence contours and cosmic pull; rhythmic prose modulates from intent flow to calm pulse. No head-hopping or elision; diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Patterned repetition of "smoothed hush" and "whispered secrets" teaches motif but creates paraphrase loops dulling peak density, e.g., multiple silence mappings. Rhythms vary but overwriting metaphors in ritual beats obscure propulsion slightly; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami ritual hushing cosmic code via earthly brook; "tranquil blaze" oxymoron transforms trope poetically. Risky lyric fantasy feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
