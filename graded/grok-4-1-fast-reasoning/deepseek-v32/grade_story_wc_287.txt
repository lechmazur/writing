<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's wistfully pragmatic motivation roots concrete micro-choices like crafting mirrors from the gauge, earning the final alignment; embodied longing in petal-watching shows contradictory impulses without labels. Hal's brief pressure via gift fits scope. Final solidarity feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: petal drop seeds pattern, density builds to mirror array activation as Charged Poise RR with effort cost legible in "night after night." Orientation anchors early; one tightening suffices. Closure image reconfigures dark corners undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight as resource constrains mirror tactics, fire escape as micro-setting charges final push; sensory details (oil/metal smell, clink) filter through Aris's priorities. Chalk drawing/moss reveal in climax elevates. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reflect light) signaled early, textural escalation via crafting rhythm to full-moon activation forecloses natural blooming path with labor cost. Agency in alignment narrows options; river of light charges image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of light/dark solidarity emerges from particulars like moss gleam/cat eyes, reweighted in final image without statement. Closing "silent dialogue" resonates non-literally, tying motivation to reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (petal spiral, light tributaries) biases toward reflection; stable close third-person. Hal's gruff "For you" carries subtext naturally. Rhythm modulates to awe at climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in "cut, polish, set, adjust"; metaphors cohere (light as river/tributaries/petal) without muddle, varying rhythm peaks at "slow river of cold light awoke." Zero loops; propulsion matches beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gauge-to-mirrors transforms lockmaster trope into light-garden ingenuity; lyric risk heightens closure image inevitability. No derivative echoes; bold poetic frame commits fully.</comment>
