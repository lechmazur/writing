<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's contradictory impulses—loyalty to father's rigid con vs. pure fair-trade longing—act simultaneously in the ink pot gaze and breach decision, earning the severing note with relational cost. Aris applies targeted pressure via geometry proofs; Stefan's traits constrain via "active waiting." Flawless under causal lens; no unearned epiphanies touch climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: setup (ink pot clarity) → breach → DC disguise act → Aris escape and note CR with severance cost legible in Stefan's understanding. Orientation anchors by para 2; shards transition legibly. No ambiguity or unkept setups; pivotal breach pays off prior constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prep room's formaldehyde and table constrain climax disguise, mirroring "deathly vitality" deception; ink pot as micro-setting charges closure note. Sensory hierarchy (Eli notices cosmetics amid crisis) biases via POV. Evolves with rain-breach; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fair trade) signaled early, tightens causally at breach: father's plan narrows to zero, Eli's agency improv costs paternal tie (note forecloses path). Escalation driven by protagonist; cost unmistakable in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fair trade theme emerges via ink pot shift (rigid con → fluid truth), Aris proofs, note's non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity in Eli's severance embraces cost; no tidy binaries or echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature (math equations, liquefied thinking) biases sharply; dialogue subtextual (Aris's "demonstrable theorem"). Rhythm modulates crisis; no leakage or register drift in peak breach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., breach para layers action/sensory without loops); rhythm varies, metaphors purposeful (poison thread) without muddle in climax. Zero scaffolds; opening anchors stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: funeral disguise for asylum via con tools transforms tropes; ink pot/breach turn inevitable from setup. Bold risk (grotesque ritual) heightens stakes organically; no derivatives.</comment>
