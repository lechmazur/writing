<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's desperately jocular mask over hollow ache shows contradictory impulses in scene via forced smiles and jokes, earning his softening into genuine amusement; woman interaction reveals micro-choice hierarchy with reciprocity token exchange. Minor repetition of jocular trait feels label-adjacent without deeper embodied cost in peak crowd moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rumor chains and token exchanges build density to Charged Poise closure: moon rock returns warm, placed on map amid collective mission, reweighting loneliness premise with felt communal cost in final station image.

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-strangled iron ribs and platform maps as command center constrain Aris's logistics and charge final image of revived station humming with connection; sensory details (pitted moon rock, low buzz, children's pigeon chase) selectively mirror shift from absence to presence through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure loneliness via contacts) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through cascade of exchanges narrowing isolation options; agency in facilitating introductions and envoy deal forces trade-off with sustained effort cost legible in agreement moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid images, but patterned loops in "improbable rumor chains" (4x) and "polite anarchy" (3x) create synonym churn across beats, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase in repeated reciprocity explanations without added pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disaster logistics for loneliness via moon rock talisman and rumor festival transforms isolation trope; risk in poetic accumulative style heightens stakes through station's evolution from goodbye to connection without gimmickry.</comment>
