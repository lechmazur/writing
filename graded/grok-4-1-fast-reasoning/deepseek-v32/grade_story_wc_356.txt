<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via olfactory sensitivity and internal conflict between frenzy ("motions becoming frantic") and stillness, earning the shift to stewardship with felt cost of tempered ambition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed adjustments to passive observation ("simply sat"), culminating in CR closure via shoot piercing soil and internal bloom, with legible cost of accepted non-control.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Treetop canopy and terrarium constrain choices (daily tweaks, storm's "moist breath"), charging final image; olfactory hierarchy POV-specific and vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bloom seed) signaled early, tightens via frenzy-to-stillness agency under Accumulative lens; one deepening ("smelled a new note") narrows options with time/frenzy cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of serenity-in-motion emerges organically from seed's dormancy to shoot, resonant non-literal answer in "quiet field of wildflowers" reweighting ambition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with olfactory perceptual signature; voice rhythmic and modulated (lyric hush to stately progress), purposeful compression legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("foreign vine," repeated "hush") slightly dulls mid-frenzy beat without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory herbalism and corpse flower in treetop hush transforms growth trope; risk in abstract "tide's thought" heightens stakes organically.</comment>
