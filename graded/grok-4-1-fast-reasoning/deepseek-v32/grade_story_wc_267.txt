<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to understand safety's cost drives consistent micro-choices from bolt discovery to governor confrontation. Embodied nerve regeneration anchors interiority without clichés. Closure resolve as curator feels earned via accumulative revelations, though minor epiphanic summary in final lines tempers peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via discovery chain (bolt → letters → governor), culminating in CR closure: Elian's resolve reconfigures silence's cost. Orientation anchored early in fortress. Cost legible in "safety has a price" and blood reveal; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Snow-shroud and cobalt walls constrain isolation, mirroring internal thaw. Bolt as micro-setting charges choices (extracted, replaced) and final image. Sensory selection (cold object, weak winter light) purposeful, POV-filtered without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety's cost) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through letters' reveal and governor's admission. Agency in investigation forecloses passive endurance. Felt cost in sorrow surge and fragile hope charges ending without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of suppression-for-safety emerges organically from letters and blood-discoloration image, reweighting premise in governor's "perhaps...you have already begun." No moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (nerve tingles, frostbitten hope). Voice rhythmic, diction controlled (e.g., "internal thaw"). Governor dialogue subtextual, natural; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors cohere (snow/thaw). Minor loops in "unpardonable silence," "frostbitten hope" repetitions slightly dull texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bolt-as-legacy transforms mundane discovery into resilient symbol. Quiet fortress arc fresh via blood twist; risks lyrical closure without gimmick.</comment>
