<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in compulsion to give drives release of bugs as pivotal micro-choice with embodied cost in destitution; fisherwoman adds relational pressure. Interiority concrete in "hollow step" and heartbeat sync, but final epiphany "transformation was not a single moment" tilts tidy without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descriptive density of lights/hush/celestials builds to CR closure in bug release and volcano sigh, reweighting premise with felt cost of old self freed. Single continuous scene oriented early ("black sand beach at the foot of an active volcano"); fisherwoman arrival complicates via prophecy without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Black sand "cool beneath him," volcano "whispering hush," bugs blending with "starlight" integrate tactilely, constraining jar placement and release while charging final constellation image. Sensory hierarchy (visual glows over subtle steam) reflects Aris's priorities; setting evolves from threat to sanctuary, mirroring transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transformation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fisherwoman recognition and bug release forcing stance crystallization under volcano pressure. One deepening (prophecy fulfillment narrows to presence-as-gift) with cost in unintended weight of shell; coincidence complicates but agency in release lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation via accidental kindnesses emerges organically from bug release shifting prophecy image; final "texture...gritty like sand, soft like light" offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in fisherwoman's tales layers despair-to-hope; avoids tidy binaries via Aris's clarity amid destitution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in light/beat syncs; rhythmic diction modulates from "hollow step" tension to serene release. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You bring the calm lights"), distinguishing fisherwoman's awe from Aris's denial; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "orchestrated coincidences," "texture of transformation," and "vibrant hush" (e.g., repeated in final third) create synonym churn dulling closure image; template cadence in descriptive runs ("He had..."). Density strong otherwise with propulsion in release sequence, but artifacts cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bugs-as-captured-stars fulfilling prophecy transforms destitute giving trope; accidental orchestration feels inevitable from detour presence. Risk in volcano-calming coincidence heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
