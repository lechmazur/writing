<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to learn echo origins clear and drives release of Kael's echo with felt cost, but interiority favors poetic summaries like "heavy with the weight of unheard stories" over embodied contradictory impulses in pivotal singing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through echo fragments to CR closure where Elara releases Kael's echo, reweighting her duty with emotional cost in "echo of peace"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via new echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus under starlight constrains path-tracing and charges final release image; sensory vibrations and whispers reflect perceptual bias, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to learn/maintain nexus tightens accumulatively with Kael's trapped echo forcing release; agency in singing back forecloses preservation path with legible melancholy cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished stories seeking completion emerges organically via fragments and release, resonant non-literal answer in final peace-echo reweighting preservation vs. letting go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sonic perceptual signature suits echo singer; rhythmic melancholy texture modulates but occasional elevated diction drifts from lived immediacy in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("webs of intrigue," "universe hummed") across beats create synonym churn without payoff, dulling propulsion; artifacts persist into final third, harming closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sonic webs of memory and echo immortality via regret transform loss tropes through perceptual specificity; fresh synthesis inevitable in release reconfiguration.</comment>
