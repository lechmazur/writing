<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—methodical chronicling as self-punishment vs. craving relief—act simultaneously, earning the final forgiveness realization tied to sister's death with emotional cost. Interiority concrete via post-medication clarity and embodied pauses. Flaw of frozen panic drives inevitable struggle without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density from maps → graffiti → music → writing, culminating in on-page CR ("forgiveness... continuing the story") with cost of acknowledging failure and leaving maps. Orientation anchored early (station, post-meds mission). Single scene coherent, no shards or transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station's ivy/rust/bathroom graffiti selectively constrain reflection and charge final image (dusk ivy shadows, water scent). Accordion as micro-setting handled tactilely, mirroring repair. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (geographic decay over irrelevants).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgiveness via chronicle) signaled early, tightens via graffiti deepening that reweights self-punishment to persistence. Agency in writing final allusion forecloses punitive path with felt cost (love remains despite failure). Pressure coheres accumulatively to CR without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>River/flow motif emerges organically from maps/graffiti/music, reweighting premise in final image ("current... step into it") without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from theme; ambiguity lingers in "unfinished" self. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature: raw clarity post-meds biases toward geographic truths over fog. Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in lantern-lit writing. No dialogue; diction purposeful, voice-modulated without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/insight (e.g., "music felt like water finding cracks") with zero loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies for propulsion; metaphors coherent (ivy decay to water persistence). No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: graffiti "A river cannot get lost" as pivot transforms abandoned-station epiphany via accordion repair and sister allusion. Bold risk in lyric accumulative CR over plot beats; no derivative templates.</comment>
