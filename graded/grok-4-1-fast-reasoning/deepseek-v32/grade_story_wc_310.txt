<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of stellar doubt and quiet enthusiasm act simultaneously in repeated coin casts despite futility; final catalyst choice earned by mounting bursts with visible cost of prior doubt melting. Interiority concrete via doubt gnawing faith amid steady hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of distilled bursts tightens to cadence shift at coin circle ("amber began to resonate, then crack"), on-page DC reconfiguration with legible cost in stagnation reversed. Single scene, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber encasing constrains action as "prison of stillness," charges closure when it cracks under coin hum; sensory hierarchy via clatter/static/whisper reflects Elrin's attuned perception. Micro-setting (console star chart) guides coin alignments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alignment amid stagnation) deepens accumulatively via bursts narrowing to internal realization; agency in escalating casts forecloses external reaching with cost felt in "futility" overcome at catalyst turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reversing stagnation emerges organically from inverted phrases to final vibration initiation; resonant non-literal answer in coins floating "purposeful," reweighting prophecy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in harmonics parsing; rhythmic diction modulates cosmic texture ("static crackled, a raw noise") without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid images, but minor paraphrase loops in repeated "cast the coins" sequences (−0.4); no closure harm, rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coin catalysis reversing cosmic contraction feels inevitable; risk in backwards prophecy payoffs heightens stakes organically.</comment>
