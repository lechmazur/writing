<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation intensifies convincingly from millennia of seeking to "desperate intrigue sharper than any feeling he'd known in centuries," earning the final self-unraveling with embodied cost. Contradictory realization ("intrigue turned to chilling realization") acts in the peak scene. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices like manipulating lodestones reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm hum triggers lodestone manipulation, gateway, whispers, then void participation with unraveling cost. Orientation anchors early (tower, storm, immortal Elian). Closure as CR lands on-page ("tearing, not of space, but of self") with undeniable conceptual price, reweighting eternity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains choices ("corridors folding like origami") and charges closure image ("escondite collapsed... ordinary stone"). Sensory hierarchy vivid: colors as "substances," geometry "tasted," hum "felt more than heard." Tower/escondite evolution mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (after-goodbye discovery) signaled early, tightens causally via gateway entry and whispers to participation realization, narrowing to self-unraveling agency. Cost unmistakable: "immortal threads... begin to unravel." Escalation driven by Elian's choices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: after goodbye is "unobserved... perfect and whole," resonant via final image without statement. Echoes ("final goodbyes") reweight premise. Complexity in cost (eternity forfeited) avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: dimensional twists "away from his gaze when unobserved." Voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, prose texture distinct (e.g., "spatial mutiny where angles fractured"). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("magnetic filaments dancing... accusing ghosts") in opener purposeful, but peak beats cleaner. Propulsion clear in "low thrum... pulse through the tower stones."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magnetic amulet enables spatial suicide for existential answer, transforming immortality trope via physics-magic fusion. Risky CR closure ("absence—the profound, peaceful silence") inevitable from priors. Bold, non-obvious angle on eternity.</comment>
