<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's chef sensory interiority and motivation to smooth memories compel the subsumption choice with embodied cost to her regrets; Elara's handshake reveals relational pressure effectively, though final epiphany phrasing slips toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds from arrival to pavilion discovery and touch flood, delivering Charged Poise closure in coral dissolution where Mira's "palate forever altered" makes cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Damp desert fortress and frozen coral pavilion constrain touch climax and charge final mist image; chef-biased sensory hierarchy (taste of regret, saline chill) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Remorse stake tightens accumulatively via dune collapse and contagious flood, forcing Mira's agency in subsumption trade-off; cost unmistakably reshapes her interior landscape on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subsuming collective pain emerges implicitly through coral as crystallized regret and final lighter steps, offering resonant non-literal answer that reweights absorption's cost without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct chef perceptual signature in tasting history and weeping mist; minimal dialogue natural, rhythmic modulation heightens dawn release without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High-density sensory prose varies rhythm effectively under pressure, though "sturdy brittle" recurrence and minor purple edges like "perfect bowl" nudge below flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef and contagious coral remorse in rain-slicked desert transforms tropes, with risky lyric absorption yielding inevitable fragile peace image.</comment>
