<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to welcome nuance roots clearly in stone heart's stir after dome secret, intensifying via quest actions; incisively kind precision shown in guiding fish, aligning traits to choices. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations cascade from ampoule vapor, tightening density to CR closure in projected murals reweighting history; cost legible in "enriching it, making the history... a living... lesson." Continuous scene fits scope, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden's dome crack and clamshell fountain constrain telepathic amplification and ampoule quest, charging final sunlight beam murals; sensory details (luminous seaweed, swaying foxglove glass) selective via Aethel's bias, mirroring inner nuance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake signals early via purpose to weave nuance; escalation deepens accumulatively through layered revelations narrowing stark certainty, agency in ampoule-crack fusion foreclosing simplistic verdict with conceptual cost in garden's sigh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of complexity in truth emerges from revelation particulars, final tapestry image resonantly reweights hubris with "fear, love, sacrifice, and error" sans moralizing; invites ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in telepathic whispers and stone grace; poetic diction/rhythm modulates aqueous pace, consistent under revelation pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated image/action, rhythm varies read-aloud; patterned "thread" repetition purposeful but borders loop (−0.4), minor synonym churn in revelations dulls peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh underwater statue questing foxglove potion transforms hubris trope via telepathic nuance-weaving; risk in lyric accumulative revelations heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
