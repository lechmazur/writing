<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in the pull to cling versus ghostly resolve during the memory's crescendo, earning the final renunciation with embodied cost; minor diagnostic labels like "translate isolation into independence" slightly abstract the motivation without fully dramatizing friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from shell's murmur to full voice and symphony, delivering Charged Poise closure in the hollow space and final walk free; orientation anchored early in garden and twilight, one tightening via star's fade tightens to undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet garden and resonance stones constrain the archiving action and charge the final quiet image; sensory details like humming stones and trembling petals selectively mirror emotional unfolding through Elara's biased perception, evolving causally with light shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to archive before star fades escalates accumulatively via deepening memory pull and crescendo, forcing renunciation with legible emotional cost in the hollow space; agency in channeling will narrows options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of archiving pain for freedom emerges organically from shell-to-stone progression and final image reweighting isolation as strength; resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing, with memory's beauty/pain complexity lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in enchanted skepticism filtering garden details; rhythmic modulation builds to terse closure lines, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops in "tragically radiant" and "ghostly resolve" across beats dull peak propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-quarantined-sound archived via resonance stones transforms loss trope into inevitable liberation; risk in solo lyrical arc heightens stakes, with seashell's silence recharging premise organically.</comment>
