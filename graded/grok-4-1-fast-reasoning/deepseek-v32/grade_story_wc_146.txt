<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's infinite patience shown concretely through weeks of pacing and adjustments compels the final furious circuit; embodied sensing of discord in bones roots motivation without labels. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong, but final thrust earns closure without unmotivation. Single-POV interiority particular and voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footsteps build echoes toward dust-weeping crisis, culminating in on-page RR (arch's perfect tone explodes, dust seals) with felt cost of imminent snap averted. One tightening via dust signals collapse; orientation anchored early in archway and fork. Closure image ("ebony...warm") reconfigures sonic potential legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archway as micro-setting constrains climax (keystone mortar thrust); cobblestones enable method, dust charges urgency. Sensory hierarchy sonic-biased (fork drinks light, arch sings discordant note), filtered through Silas's ear. Evolving details (weeping dust ceases) mirror restoration without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert collapse/restore harmony) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via returning echoes to dust then furious circuit; agency in adjusted walks narrows to chorus-summoning final act. Cost legible in "final sonic snap" threat, felt in urgent boot-slam. One deepening tightens options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sonic balance emerges from particulars: fork's tone weaves into footsteps/echoes, final tapestry reconfigures silence-to-song without moralizing. Resonant CR in "peaceful, listening kind" hush reweights premise. Ambiguity lingers in "canvas...for life," earned via patient struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable, sonic perceptual signature ("vibrated in his bones," "buzzing...warmth") biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from patient hush to furious percussion. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged final image. Voice distinct, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "paced...stitching sound" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrought figuration ("needle...quilt," "drinks the light") in setup doesn't muddle peaks; closure prose clean, vivid ("tone exploded outward").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sonic revival via footsteps/fork transforms ghost-town trope into fresh synthesis; patient's rhythm-building to arch-thrust feels inevitable from established pattern. Bold risk in abstract "frequencies/balance" grounded tactilely; no derivative echoes, closure ingenuity heightens stakes.</comment>
