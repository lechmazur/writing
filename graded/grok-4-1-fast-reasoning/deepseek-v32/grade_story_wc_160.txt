<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harmonize values roots consistently in traits like ingenuity and belief in builders' compassion, driving micro-choices like prying the slab. Embodied emotions peak in "hands began to tremble not from the volcanic pulse, but from excitement," showing contradiction. Closure renunciation (supplement, not replace) earned by prior causality, though minor label-speak ("dappled resolve") slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pollen residue clue → measurements with chain → hidden vent discovery → clearing valve → "final, resonant click" DC closes floodgate, easing breathing. Orientation anchors Elara, amphitheater, volcano by paragraph 1. Cost legible in "sweat on her brow... solution imperfect but true," foreclosing full replacement with visible compromise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains: tremors quiver chain links during measurements, violent tremble sifts dust at climax, mineral scent grounds warmth. POV machinist filters via "porous rock expanded and contracted." Charges final image with chain "coiled at her feet, a testament to measured compromise."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vs. secure) signaled early, tightens causally via pollen clue narrowing options to hidden valve. Protagonist agency clears clog despite "fear gripped her" during violent tremble. Cost unmistakable in sweat, eased rhythm, and imperfect harmony foreclosing extremes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing via encoded compassion emerges organically from discovery events, not statement. Final image reweights premise: chain as "testament to measured compromise" offers non-literal answer to conflicting values. Minor risk of overtness in "encrypted compassion was now clear."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with machinist perceptual signature (noting "precise length" of chain, "relief valve's pathway"). Rhythm modulates tension: short sentences in "ground gave a sudden, violent tremble. Dust sifted." Elevated diction purposeful for antique feel, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: sensory details advance action (tremors creak machinery). Varied rhythm, no loops despite "tremble" recurrence tied to motif. Minor scaffold in "dappled resolve, a mix of shadowed doubt and bright hope" slightly hedges, but closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pollen-in-adhesive clue in volcano amphitheater transforms floodgate repair trope into "encrypted compassion" discovery. Risky "building breathes" motif heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from early conflicting values to measured compromise.</comment>
