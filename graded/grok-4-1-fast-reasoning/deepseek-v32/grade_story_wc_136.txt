<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandfather's journal compels quest choices effectively until book revelation; analytically artistic traits shown in pattern-seeing but verge on labels without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority concrete in "trembling certainty" but emotions lean stock/performed at vault entry. Final change credible endurance of old habits with cost, yet lacks blind spots compounding mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as crack-arrows and mist density build to fortress entry and book CR closure; orientation anchored early at city's edge. One tightening at punch-use tears reality, narrowing to chamber. Cost legible in personal truth ignored long, reconfiguring maps-reliance in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Starlit vault in mist pressures choices with cold/thickening fog narrowing perception; recurring cracks/arrows as micro-setting constrain path and charge final etched-heart image. Sensory vivid/selective (glowing faintly, spectral edges shimmering). Carvings mirror analytical priorities without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fortress truths) signaled early tightens accumulatively via arrow-follow to punch-door, forcing endurance with fear/excitement mix; agency in daring activation forecloses retreat. Escalation deepens knowledge at book, cost felt in regrets/secrets vibration. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of charted vs. discovered routes emerges organically from arrow-follow and book truths, resonant in "maps mere approximations" realization without moralizing. Final image reweights premise non-literally as arrows fade but etch heart. Subtext in concealment carvings invites ambiguity; minor drift to platitudes at close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with analytical perceptual signature in pattern/carving notice; voice texture poetic/rhythmic but modulates unevenly under stress. No dialogue; free indirect clean. Purposeful repetition ("trembling certainty") taught early but risks uniformity at chamber peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("unspoken truths," "mysteries unraveled") and synonym churn (cracks/arrows, bad habits/new starts) across multiple beats dull density, esp. final third repetition of transformation. Template cadence in "She [action]" runs and "felt a mix" phrasing drag momentum. Rhythms vary but overwriting in vault descriptions stalls propulsion; closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cracks-as-arrows guidance and phantom punch transforms quest trope into textural pattern-build to CR; irreplaceable fortress truths reweighting feels inevitable. Risk in surreal vault pays off without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
