<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between empire duty and dream propagation act vividly in the violin-touch vision and playing choice, earning the final renunciation with embodied exhaustion. Interiority particular through plant static and coffee stains. Caretaker's minimal pressure fits scope without dilution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions and whispers densify to CR closure where violin dims post-propagation, cost legible in "its glow perceptibly dimmer." Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. Patterned elision of possibilities pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard plants and jasmine constrain via telepathic input, charging final thriving cascade image. Sensory hierarchy (green static, frigid touch, mulberry ache) filters through Elara's bias. Micro-setting of pedestal and drapes guides the playing act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (authenticate vs. propagate) signaled in opening commission, deepens accumulatively via coffee perforations and plant memory to agency in bow draw, foreclosing empire path with dimmer glow cost. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of growth vs. possession emerges from violin-as-seed and scattered worlds, resonant in "dream was lighter, and therefore could fly farther" without statement. Final image reweights propagation non-literally. Organic from particulars, ambiguity lingers fruitfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("green static of yearning," "perforated destiny") biases noticing; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under stress. Brief dialogue natural, goal-pursuing. Experimental diction taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and multi-job lines; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrit in opening metaphors ("twilight bruise," "mulberry ache") voice-motivated but borders coherence in peak playing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy, coffee divination, and reality-seeding violin transforms fantasy tropes via perforated possibilities. Risky CR closure heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early stains to dimming glow.</comment>
