<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in personal vanished path drives persistent micro-choices like foam collection and flower-touching; realization integrates loss as seed for purpose with felt cost. Mild internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via new seed's whisper contradicting conjectures; CR closure in "paths become part of something larger" reconfigures premise with legible cost in fading glyphs. One tightening suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iridescent geode cave constrains work and mirrors mixed emotions, evolving to brighten in final beam of light that charges closure image with enduring transience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding vanishings tightens accumulatively via contradictory glyph/whisper and fading memories forcing deepened conjecture; cost felt in "glyphs on the glass growing faint."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformative disappearance emerges organically from foam/seeds/glyphs; final image of rainbow patterns offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, though mild repetition borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature attuned to emotional glyphs/whispers; rhythmic diction modulates from process to insight without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in closing paragraphs ("paths disappear" variants restate insight without new pressure) dull closure density; motif repetition like "cheerful gloom" purposeful but risks template cadence in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory work via foam, glass, seeds transforms vanishing trope into cycle of beginnings; bold lyric conceit feels inevitable in geode's charged poise.</comment>
