<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to seek courage post-leash snap roots consistently in relief/emptiness contradiction, embodied via echoing void. Internal impulses layer without alternation. Realization earned through journey micro-choices, though border-line epiphanic phrasing slightly softens peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ridgeway solitude to shore insight via patterned motifs. Orientation anchored immediately ("alone on the veiled ridgeway"). CR closure lands cleanly ("courage... realization within herself") with felt cost of neglected choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory selection (shoreline lullaby air, cold ticket punch) filters through Elara's seeking urgency, constraining indirect routes. Veiled ridgeway's deceptive trails guide choices purposefully. Starlight shore charges final image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find courage) signaled early, tightens texturally via vigil/detours to internal reweighting. Agency in purposeful meandering forecloses external quest illusion with emptiness cost. No reversals needed; density escalation coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of internal courage emerges organically from leash-to-heart arc, subtext in guide's smile/point. Final image ("rhythm remained in her heartbeat") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity lingers in prior duty's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward rhythmic persistence motifs. Prose texture (lullaby cadence) modulates consistently, lyric compression taught early. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("pointed to her heart").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("emptiness... void that echoed with possibilities"; "gently persistent" x2) and repetitive phrasing dull propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies but template echoes in descriptive runs. Density high overall, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms duty-leash trope into textured internal quest via star-stamped rite and spectral bridge. Fresh synthesis of ferry vigil with courage metaphor feels organic. Risks poetic indirection without gimmick.</comment>
