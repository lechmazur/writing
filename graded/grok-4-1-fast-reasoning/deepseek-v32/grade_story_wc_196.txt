<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and particular, with her fractured heart embodied in feeling "at home among these forgotten records"; micro-choices like pocketing the button and late-night research compel her arc. Contradictory impulses surface in her "tactfully hopeful" demeanor amid personal loss, earning the final resilience without tidy resolution. Flawless under single-POV defaults, with motivation intensifying via discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: discoveries layer density from button drop to archival note, culminating in Charged Poise closure—"her heart not whole, but now intertwined with a resilience"—with legible emotional cost in returning the button. Orientation anchors early (Elara in file room, post-emancipation files). One tightening via unfurled log suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust, brittle paper, and "smell of old paper and despair" selectively filter through archivist's bias, constraining choices like pattern-reading; button as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency, evolving with action (swollen folder yields). No white-room; era-specific details (1866 files, regimental rolls) plausible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify kindnesses) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through button/log/Aris discoveries, narrowing to her personal reconfiguration with felt cost (heartache softened via intervention's echo). Agency in methodical probing forces trade-offs; one decisive intensification via donor notation suffices under lens. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of small kindnesses amid emancipation's neglect emerges organically from button's arc—planted seed to quiet testament—reweighting history's grand narratives without statement. Final image ("dust settled, its hidden kindness finally magnified") offers non-literal resonance, tying Elara's arc to conceptual cost of silence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in possibility ("believed it possible").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: archivist notices "dust patterns," "dog-eared" edges idiomatically. Prose texture modulates rhythmically—"paper resisted, then yielded with a soft sigh"—under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits era/POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere (e.g., "tarnished... like a fallen star" purposeful, not muddled); varied syntax propels without loops or scaffolds. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with discovery cadence; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Minor figurative density in opener contained, no peak-beat overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival detective work uncovering micro-history (button as dignity relic) transforms lost-boy trope via dust-pattern method and post-war context. Risk in quiet accumulative drive heightens stakes; no derivatives, premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Within-band boost for bold POV on "examined unknown."</comment>
