<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ghostwriting past intensifies to compel art installation choice, earning change from vault to curator; interiority whimsical-particular via nest perception. Weakness: minimal contradictory impulses, smooth epiphany at "the thread... willingness to weave" lacks embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nest incites collection/weaving, density builds to unveiling reunion as CR (Charged Poise), cost legible in "secret kept and now joyfully released." Orientation anchored early; summary of "days" collection is efficient ellipsis without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pond edge constrains collecting discards, mirroring internal search; recurring "prismatic quiet" and lilies charge final image. Sensory selection whimsical-POV filtered, purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find connection thread) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via nest-to-sculpture deepening, agency in inviting contributions narrows to personal vulnerability at reunion. Cost felt in exposure but low visceral pressure overall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of woven connections emerges from nest/sculpture particulars, final image ("endless spiral") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in anonymous tokens invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with whimsical perceptual signature ("spilled kaleidoscope"); voice rhythmic, diction controlled. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual: "I never sent the letter" advances closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short unveiling sentences propel); density high, no loops. Minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("jeweled every petal") but coherent, not muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter secrets into nest-spiral art transforms tropes; risk in public vulnerability heightens reunion ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
