<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Elara's "cautious exuberance" and gentle non-forceful choices earn Leo's change, embodied via curl touch and music mimicry during eclipse climax. Leo's hand-stilling and speech reveal particular flaws under pressure. Final humming shows earned relational reconfiguration with fragile cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to Charged Poise closure in shared humming braid, reweighting connection with subtle cost ("therapy of moments, not miracles"). Single scene oriented early; one tightening via eclipse suffices. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Eclipse corona and crickets constrain shared moment, guitar/curl as micro-setting charge final image where Leo hums melody fragment. Sensory hierarchy (metallic gray light, cooling air) POV-filtered through Elara's musical lens. Purposeful details evolve with shadow's devour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture Leo's wonder) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to eclipse reversal where hand reaches/speaks, narrowing isolation via density shift. Elara's adaptive mimicry shows agency; cost legible in flinch and fragile endurance charging humming image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" emerges via guitar-eclipse link, culminating in non-literal door-to-wonder reprise where humming reweights prior fracture. Ambiguity lingers in subtle spark without tidy moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature ("vibration of string and air") stable in Elara-limited POV. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It's like a hole"; "A door, maybe") advances link. Rhythmic control modulates to hushed intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm ("hush of dreaming roots" bookends teach pattern); no loops/artifacts dull propulsion. Metaphors coherent/integrated (roots for subtle growth). Vivid propulsion peaks at corona "silvery bloom."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse therapy transforms child-wonder trope via tactile music/curl constraints. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Humming braid feels inevitable from established adaptive pattern.</comment>
