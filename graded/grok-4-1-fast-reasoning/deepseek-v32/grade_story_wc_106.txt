<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's quietly savvy trait drives micro-choices like the gentle smile and jar deployment against the guard, earning her epiphany; contradictory calm amid interruption feels embodied. Guard as secondary applies immediate pressure, forcing reinterpretation. Final renunciation from thief to curator forecloses prior path with conceptual cost in the jar lightening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal early, accumulative/textural to CR closure) holds; flower codes cause room entry, guard creak tightens to jar switch, epiphany reconfigures purpose with lighter jar cost on final platform. Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 2. One tightening via interruption suffices; CR lands legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Green-veined marble, dying sunset shadows constrain timing ("had to move now"), lilies code tactics; light motifs mirror internal shift, charging moonlight finale where station's silence enables epiphany image. Sensory hierarchy (visual urgency narrows to glows) integrates via POV bias. Micro-setting (jar, portrait pillar) shapes choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture illuminated joy) signaled early, guard interruption deepens via agency (jar projection shares moment, enabling switch). Under hybrid lens, pressure crystallizes stance to open-hand curation; visible risk/cost in entranced guard nod and purpose trade-off charges ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sharing light over hoarding emerges via portrait projection and jar-listen shift, reweighting thief premise without statement; final "open hand" image answers destiny-door question resonantly. Particulars (guard's sincere expression) build complexity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with light-obsessed perceptual signature ("illuminated moments captured in paint"); dialogue subtextual (sunset fondness disarms). Rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "She had to move now"; no head-hopping, elision taught via codes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/light imagery without loops; syntax varies for propulsion ("A beam of cool, silver light lanced out"). Minor lyrical overwriting in openings doesn't muddle closure; clean mechanics, vivid verbs propel to epiphany.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonbeam jar and flower codes transform thief trope into light-curation premise; epiphany ("curator of light?") feels inevitable from portrait projection/guard share. Risky fantasy synthesis (destiny hum) heightens stakes organically, no hedging.</comment>
