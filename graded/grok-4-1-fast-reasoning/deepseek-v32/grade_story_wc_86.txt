<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to recycle mistakes drives the pivotal proposal, embodied in heart-thrumming tension and micro-choice to override protocol; contradictory calm amid risk feels earned. Captain's suspicion to curt nod reveals status dynamics under pressure. Minor label-speak in "uncommonly thoughtful" slightly abstracts trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from past apology cue to charged poise in captain's "I will consider the mechanism," reconfiguring bitterness with felt unknotting cost in final image of left drawer pull. Single scene oriented instantly; one tightening via proposal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded parapet constrains signals ("voice carried away by wind") and choreography (midpoint pass); drawer pull as micro-setting charges final contemplative image. Sensory hierarchy (damp coat, warm palm) reflects Aris's thoughtful POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bloodless exchange via untethering) signaled early, tightens via proposal against captain's jaw-line suspicion, forcing agency in gesture; cost legible in risked protocol and uncertain nod narrowing future hatred options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mechanisms/recycling emerges organically from drawer pull story and moon-tide analogy, answered non-literally in left offering and "space for [forgiveness] to grow"; reweights prior apology without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic perceptual signature ("furrowed hush," philosophical hinges); voice modulates rhythmically from tense buildup to contemplative close, dialogue sparse but subtext-rich in captain's curt response.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels (short thrum sentences amid lyrical swells); high density weaves setting/action, minor figurative density early ("mist clung like furrowed hush") taught as voice without muddle. No loops; final line recharges motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carpenter totem in war rite transforms prisoner exchange trope; drawer pull's "key to nothing" risk heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via thoughtful Aris's orbit-patience arc.</comment>
