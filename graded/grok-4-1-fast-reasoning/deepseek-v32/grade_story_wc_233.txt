<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Queen's motivation to unravel dreams drives climb and exhale with consistency; embodied awe at "bleeding starlight" reveals character under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal grotto moment, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through climb-to-grotto build and Conceptual Repricing closure at fireflies weaving patterns reflecting reign; orientation anchored early in balcony/dreams; cost legible in "lighter yet weighted" heart resolving disenchantment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto's dripping light and hiss constrain solitude-to-connection choice and charge final image; sensory details like thin air, mist sea, and pooled light filter through queen's priorities, evolving with ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling dreams amid warnings tightens accumulatively via climb's peril and exhale reversal; agency in shared breath forecloses ignorance with felt cost in power's fragility realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of power's lacy menace emerges organically from bleeding starlight and firefly patterns reweighting reign without statement; resonant CR in "disenchantment was not an end, but a clarity" invites ambiguity on duty's seep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias toward dream-images; rhythmic texture modulates from meditative climb to awe-thick silence; no dialogue, but "softly commanding voice" fits voice without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with ascent's meditation to grotto's hush; high density in light-pooling images, but minor motif loops like repeated "lacy menace" slightly dull propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of queenly disenchantment via bleeding starlight/fireflies transforms trope journey; risk in lyric menace tone heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight reprise.</comment>
