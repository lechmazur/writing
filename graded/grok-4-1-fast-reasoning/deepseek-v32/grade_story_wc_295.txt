<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between academic escape and sisterly guilt act in the glyph reinterpretation beat; final writing choice earned by prior causality with embodied cost (trembling hand, sutured wound). Exceptional interiority via concrete perceptions like petal-stained telegram.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from telegram cue to glyph shift to chronicle; CR closure lands on-page in writing beat with conceptual cost of retroactive witnessing. Orientation anchored immediately in observatory; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory dome and green desk lamp constrain reflective choices; recurring stellar charts and telegram charge final image (placed beside chronicle). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's stellar bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode grief via stars) signaled early, deepens via telegram-induced reinterpretation narrowing to shared action; agency in writing forecloses isolation with legible guilt cost. One tightening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges organically from glyph shifts and variable star metaphor; final chronicle image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting isolation premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (stellar syntax on personal pain); rhythmic control heightens reflective pressure, diction biased toward astronomical idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Zero artifacts dull closure image of telegram bridging past/present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy, suicide artifact, and ancient glyphs transforms grief trope; risky lyric reflection inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via irreplaceable celestial-personal fusion.</comment>
