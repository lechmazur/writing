<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied patience shines in sustained spark hold as physical demonstration under pressure; motivation rooted in concrete goal of mapping heartbeats compels micro-choices. Minor slip: internal conflict mostly implied rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from arrangement to final spark drop, delivering Charged Poise closure with cost in precise heat fusion and joint stiffness. Orientation anchored early in orchard/crater/twilight; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frost-rimed soil and perpetual twilight constrain choices via cold-stiffened joints and audible heartbeats; recurring copper plate charges final etched image. Sensory selection (pluming breath, shivering trees) mirrors internal rhythm purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping latent rhythm) signaled early tightens accumulatively via nearing spiral completion and held spark; agency in glacial focus forecloses failure path with felt physical cost. One decisive deepening suffices; cost legible in post-seal quiet shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss/endurance emerges organically from pattern-making and sealed map; final image reweights preservation without moralizing. Returning "moving stillness" motif charges closure subtly via charged accomplishment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("listened...with her bones"); lyrical rhythm modulates tension to ignition burst. Voice texture distinct in alchemical idiom and sensory bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful repetition ("held its breath"); no loops, artifacts, or muddle—rhythm peaks crisply at "let the spark fall." Read-aloud flows with scene cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical cartography transforms withered orchard into emotional topography; risk in glacial lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via patient buildup to flash-seal.</comment>
