<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive nature shown through endured failures as "small death[s]" with silent persistence, earning spirit's vivification; contradictory hope/despair impulses act in approximations. Minor label-speak ("stoically sensitive") early slightly abstracts embodiment. Final thaw traces causally to prior toil without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: failure density builds to penny-drop CR when "She lifted the crozier high and brought it down," reconfiguring destiny chain with legible cost of self-annihilation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coherence perfect, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember Nexus's glowing coals and "frozen bloom tone" constrain ritual, flare at shatter to charge seed's paradoxical growth in final image. Sensory selection (cold ache, pulsing embers) mirrors internal ice thaw via POV bias. Micro-setting (flat stone) enables pivotal smash.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute to interrupt destiny) deepens accumulatively through iterated failures narrowing to smash-choice agency; cost felt in "internal ice" thaw and foreclosed object-vivification. Climax turn ("breakage...key") driven by prior pressure, reweights options. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges implicitly: crozier ruin births spectral bishop and self-thaw, resonant final seed-shoot recharges embers motif without moralizing. Complexity in object-failure vs. spirit-birth avoids binaries. Invite lingers via "frozen bloom" endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: notices crozier's "fractured form" amid embers, diction/rhythm modulates from iterative grind to crystalline "penny drops" clarity. Poetic texture ("twilight bled," "dying stars") voice-motivated, no leakage. Purposeful "frozen bloom" elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, purposeful "frozen bloom" recurrence without loop; metaphors cohere (embers/flame bishop). Minor scaffold in repetitive "successive approximation" phrasing dulls one mid-beat slightly. Closure image ("green shoot" in embers) crystalline, no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical crozier-shatter yields spectral bishop self-vivification, transforming trope via creative destruction calculus. Risky lyric poise (iterative grind to quiet CR) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from breakage motif.</comment>
