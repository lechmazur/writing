<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between theoretical rebellion and emotional pull, embodied in lantern carry and lighting choice; micro-choices like interpreting scrawls reveal values under melancholy pressure. Final sharing with father earns relational reconfiguration with visible frailty cost. Minor label-speak ("clover melancholy," "theoretically rebellious") borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scrawl pattern taught early accumulates to lantern projection and garden RR/Charged Poise, reweighting probability with emotional cost legible in "his hand trembling" and fading light. Mosaic shards (library-subway-park-river-garden) legible via scrawls; orientation anchored in first para. No causality breaks; cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet stone/paper, streaked windows, mossy sundial) selective via Elara's priorities, constrain choices (scrawls on seats, lantern on dial). Rain evolves causally, mirroring internal states; mica lantern as micro-setting charges closure image on father's hands. Specificity anchors midsummer damp without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (widen perspectives via traverse) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through scrawls deepening to lantern revelation narrowing cold theory path. Agency in interpretation/return forces stance crystallization; cost felt in foreclosed loneliness vs. compassionate probability. Minor abstractness in stakes less visceral until garden peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of probability embracing compassion emerges organically from scrawls/lantern contradictions, reweighted in final image of light on frail hands without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures (trembling hand, flickering light) invites ambiguity; protagonist arc inextricable from lucid contradictions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable/single, perceptual signature biased to cryptic signs/math etchings; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (rattling subway to steady candle). Dialogue sparse but subtextual ("I always saw the odds, never the stakes"); diction purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, rhythm varies (short scrawl beats to flowing reflections); minor paraphrase loops ("rainwashed" reprise purposeful but borders redundancy). Figurative language coherent in mica projections, no muddle at closure; strong verbs anchor images like "projecting jagged patterns."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subway scrawls as probability scripture guiding rebellion against father's losses; lantern's chaos/order transforms trope of reconciliation. Risky mosaic traversal heightens stakes organically; no derivative templates, closure recharges scrawl motif inevitably.</comment>
