<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-rooted (prism-mind enables absorption), but lacks embodied contradictory impulses during inversion/climax; smooth competence without micro-choice friction under pressure weakens pivotal depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain to chamber entry; closure as CR in "chamber trembled... had to leave" with time cost legible; orientation anchored early in grotto entrance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist and inversion constrain navigation/portal ("mist coiling... lifted onto ceiling"), charge final "mist seemed to part"; sensory selection purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find combinations) tightens at fork→threshold focus under causal lens; agency in mind-focus forecloses paths with hour cost visible in reversal warning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of vigilant preservation emerges organically via rune absorption and danger awareness; resonates in final transformation without moralizing, but repetition dilutes subtext at close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with prism-perceptual signature ("many-colored possibilities"); rhythmic poetic texture consistent, no head-hopping; Q7 debt caps higher potential.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn of key phrases ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze," "forgotten combinations") across final third dull propulsion; repetitive end summaries obscure closure image despite pattern intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion and threshold portals transforms quest trope; irreplaceable prism-mind + doodle logic feels inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
