<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in grandmother's postcards drives embodied micro-choices like "mixing paints to capture the elusive colors"; internal conflict emerges subtly in pondering cryptic notes versus creating synthesis, earning final endurance with legacy cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density of inspirations; strong on-page CR closure at "understood that flowers bloom at night to offer solace to those who wander in darkness... human tenderness" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of grandmother's losses legible in final mural moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion's "honeyed light over her sketches and paints" and cathedral's "etched glass showed scenes... layers that only became clear" constrain artistic process and charge mural's multi-layered geometry purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode night blooms signaled early; single meaningful deepening via cathedral visit narrows knowledge and alters mural tactics, but gentle pressure lacks sharp option foreclosure beyond felt solitude cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of nocturnal beauty as solace emerges from mural's "garden that transitioned from day to night, with flowers that seemed to glow"; resonant CR final image reweights inheritance without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with artistic perceptual signature in "shadows tinged with blue"; single POV intimacy enhances reflection, though minor syntactic repetition tempers propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Repetitive loops like "dawning hush" (3x), "reckoning" (3x), and "quiet drive/driven" variations create paraphrase churn across reflective beats, dulling density; figurative consistency aids lyricism but artifacts pervade final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of faded postcards, cathedral layers, and night-bloom mural yields inevitable "flowers... glow from within"; transforms epiphany trope through specific artistic geometry without gimmickry.</comment>
