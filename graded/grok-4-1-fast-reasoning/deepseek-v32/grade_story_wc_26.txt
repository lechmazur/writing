<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope drives observation to intervention, with embodied contradiction in her aching heart amid beauty/sadness. Micro-choices like programming counter-dreams reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: archetypal "pure motivation" phrasing slightly undercuts particularity at inciting task setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fading luminance patterns builds to shadow discovery, then intervention reconfigures dreamscape. Closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page with legible cost in "pang of luminous regret" altering hope's essence. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via footage comparison suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystalline spires, cloud sea, and observation nook vividly filter through Elara's light-attuned POV, constraining intervention via library systems. River stone as micro-setting grounds ethereal excess, recharging at desk placement in closure image. Selective sensory hierarchy (light/shadow over others) matches urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope vs. erosion) signaled early, escalates via unbound shadow discovery narrowing to intervention agency. Density cadence shift under lens forces evolution trade-off, with cost in resilience over innocence felt at blooming. Pivotal footage beat tightens visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inevitable change emerges organically from shadow integration and hope's resilient new shape, answered non-literally by stone's repriced permanence in final image. Luminous regret carries subtextual complexity without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light/shadow attunement; prose texture modulates poetically yet legibly ("softly deliberate" steps). Rhythmic control heightens pressure without opacity. No dialogue; internal voice coherent and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; varied syntax propels from observation to transformation. Minor loops in "shape of hope"/"luminous regret" phrasing slightly drag mid-section without touching closure. No major artifacts; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams and unbound shadow leaching hope transforms ethereal library trope into resonant evolution. Risky poetic fantasy commits to premise implications without retreat. Final integration turn feels inevitable from footage pattern.</comment>
