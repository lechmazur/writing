<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Alex's skepticism and recklessness drive consistent micro-choices like tuning the radio and entering the mill, with embodied drowsy alertness showing internal contradiction. Final acknowledgment to ghosts earns a subtle endurance of skepticism with moral cost. Mara's off-page confession weakens relationship crucible, but single-POV interiority stays concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: radio calls and observations build pattern to CR closure when wheel stops after Alex speaks, reweighting truth's burden with conceptual cost legible in fading glow. Orientation anchored early in tunnel post-confession. One tightening via side passage suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tunnel's damp rust and cold air constrain exploration via flashlight and rusted door; boiler room wheel as micro-setting charges final image by halting. Sensory hierarchy (smells, hum) reflects explorer's bias. Spatial choreography clear from tunnel to mill cavern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weigh swallowed truth) signaled early, accumulates density via radio/tunnel clues to climax witnessing; agency in speaking forces reconfiguration with felt moral cost. One deepening via psychic call matching wheel narrows supernatural skepticism. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths needing witness emerges via radio fragments and ghost pause, resonant in lighter hush with Mara; final image reweights skepticism without moral. No overt statements; irony in psychic method for skeptic enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in cryptic radio interpretations; rhythmic modulation from drowsy scan to sharpened clarity under stress. Prose texture distinct in industrial idiom. Minimal dialogue natural when Mara nods.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but patterned loops in "appraise," "swallowed truth," "drowsy alertness" create minor paraphrase churn across beats (−0.6). Rhythm varies; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors touch closure. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic explorer using psychic radio as lore-map transforms ghost trope; beaded wheel and ghost shift ingenuity inevitable from clues. Risk in radio method heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
