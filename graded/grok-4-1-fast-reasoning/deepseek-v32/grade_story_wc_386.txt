<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity drives micro-choices like careful listening and weaving, with embodied sensations revealing character; competent handling shows struggle balanced by gift's limits without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensations and revelations densify to closure; Conceptual Repricing via truth projection into dreams lands with cost in spirit's fade and globe's heartbeat perfection, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice walls as "perfect windows of connection" constrain weaving tactic and charge final clear blue image; selective sensory hierarchy (crevasse voice, refracted flames) reflects Elara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose truth) signaled early tightens accumulatively via Linnea's revelation narrowing options to weave/project; agency in focusing will forecloses unrest with felt cost in spirit's softening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaged purity emerges organically from globe's evolution and captain's repricing; final image of untroubled blue offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting wreckage without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in echo-weaving and ice biases; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You have my memory...And you have the windows") advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (fractal face shimmers); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or muddled metaphors, purposeful figurative like "borrowed starlight" enhances texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh dream-triangulation to glacial nexus transforms ghost story tropes; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes, synthesis of salvage/whispering inevitable via particulars.</comment>
