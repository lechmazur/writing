<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in tracing origins via tactile stamping, evolving to personal integrity quest; revelation earned through prior deductions. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("tranquilly perceptive nature") slightly abstracts peak insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from folio exams to multi-indexer revelation; CR closure ("origins are not points but processes") lands on-page with conceptual cost of solitary narrative foreclosure. Orientation anchored early in sunken library blackout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Water-damaged shelves and blackout constrain digital reliance, force analog stamp use; candle flame charges final guttering/blow-out image, mirroring resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (manuscript provenance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hypothesis to communal origins; blackout deepens focus with felt opportunity cost of time/tools. Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honest origins as iterative process emerges organically from stamp variations; final image reconfigures solitary genius premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with catalog-like perceptual signature (sorting chaos, noting stains/bindings); rhythmic modulation fits scholarly intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("reclaimed stillness" x3, "dappled resolve" x2) dull density in mid-beats; purposeful rhythm mostly propels, but repetition risks scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of submerged scholarship via analog stamps in blackout; premise transformed beyond trope via hypothesis ingenuity, closure feels inevitable.</comment>
