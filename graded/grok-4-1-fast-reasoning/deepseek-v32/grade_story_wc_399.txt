<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian's duality via half-mask enables task and charges personal truth at end ("found his own truth"), with motivation rooted in kinship to parapet's honesty; interiority concrete in sensations like "light pooled in his palms," but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through clearings and gleanings to RR closure (parapet hums, mask removed) with conceptual cost in eternal guardianship; one tightening in absorption halts motion, fully legible; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "conjured clearings" shaping path to parapet and charges final image (dunes sleep); sensory hierarchy (peripheral vision, murmurs) reflects Elian's skill, vivid and integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fading echo) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragment gathering under delicacy ("delicate process"); agency in micro-choices forecloses fade risk, but cost feels more conceptual than viscerally narrowing a live option at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fleeting truth preserved through duality emerges via particulars (echo as light/dew, mask duality), resonant in final reconfiguration without moralizing ("found his own truth"); subtext in "strangely honest" parapet reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in peripheral sensing and whispery diction; rhythmic modulation builds texture under ritual pressure, no elision or head-hopping; voice coherent and biased to mystical edges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in varied syntax, purposeful repetition (murmurs) taught early; minor paraphrase loops ("wisdom echoed," "preserve the echo") in reflection beats subtract slightly, but no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual fantasy (peripheral clearings, kinetic parapet) transforms preservation trope via duality and textural accumulation; risk in lyric mode heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at mask removal.</comment>
