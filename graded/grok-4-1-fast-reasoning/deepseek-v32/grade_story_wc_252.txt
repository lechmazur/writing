<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between dock resignation and sea yearning, embodied in thumb-tracing scrimshaw and Elara's disappointment blocking violence; final embrace earned by relational cost at scrimshaw handoff. Minor diagnostic summaries like "quiet war within him" slightly abstract emotion from peak swim.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to whale call snapping tether; on-page CR closure via whale-eye communion and shedding clothes reconfigures life with legible relational/opportunity cost in Elara's "Go" and fading island. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in dock chaos; single-shard arc tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe and black-sand shore selectively constrain choices, pulling Kael via gravity to island; whale pool charges final image as micro-setting mirroring internal unlock. Sensory hierarchy (vibration to marrow, salt breath) reflects urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs. dock weight) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via whale call forcing detachment; agency in wading/swimming forecloses old life with felt cost at Elara farewell. Minor abstractness in "fundamental cord snap" slightly mutes visceral price legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of guarded hearts unlocking via sea's embrace emerges organically from scrimshaw handoff and whale communion, reweighting yearning in final naked descent without moralizing. Resonant CR ending image ties combative tenderness to freedom's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with fluid, sea-inflected perceptual signature ("restless current," "graceful dance"); dialogue sparse but subtext-rich in Elara's sharp care. Rhythm modulates from dock combative to oceanic poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length for propulsion; metaphors like "leviathan breaching" cohere without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in "guarded eyes/heart" twice near handoff dulls one transition slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis of pirate scrimshaw legacy triggering selkie-like island pull transforms tropes via whale-call mechanics and heart-unlock motif. Risky lyric accumulation heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
