<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to end the war is rooted in personal loss and shown through gentle precision amid delegates' skepticism; contradictory ache and resolve layer effectively. Final endurance of fragile peace earns closure with her youth/innocence as felt cost. Minor slip in stock epiphanic summary at "found her own redemption" avoids higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solitary resolve to night-long negotiation, culminating in Charged Poise closure via signing under moons' conjunction with sacrifice cost legible in "lost lives, forgiven crimes." Orientation anchors immediately in terrace/midsummer. One tightening via general's scoff narrows to consensus without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (jasmine, cracked marble, moons) filters through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal states; terrace constrains ritual choices and charges final dawn image. No white-room; spatial choreography clear around table. Recurrent celestial maps/alignment propel cosmic harmony motif organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broker peace) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via scoff/arguments into dawn consensus, forcing trade-offs like sacred lands. Agency in guiding via ritual; cost visible in "surrender cherished hatreds" and her innocence. Lacks one agency-driven reversal for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of flawed redemption emerges implicitly from particulars like brittle accords and sacrifice, reweighted in final "fragile dawn" image without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures (bow, signing) invites ambiguity on permanence. Internal arc inextricable from peace's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (celestial as harmony); voice modulates lyrically under pressure, diction purposeful. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual: general's "surrender" vs. her "redemption" advances goal. No head-hopping; rhythmic control clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, syntax supports lyric texture. Minor artifacts in motif loops ("price of redemption" x3, "flawed beauty" x3) create template cadence without obscuring closure; no filter stacks. Read-aloud ear strong till repetitive stems in reflections dull peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual negotiation on cosmic terrace transforms war trope via ebony clipboard's evolving weight and flawed peace premise. Risk in lyric celestial frame heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates; turns inevitable from particulars.</comment>
