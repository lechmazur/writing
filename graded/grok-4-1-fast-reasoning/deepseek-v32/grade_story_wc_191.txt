<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wisely adventurous trait shown through careful peeling amid haste ("moved quickly but carefully"), compelling final renunciation of ambition for guardianship with nostalgic cost. Interiority concrete in "heart racing... tempered by wisdom" and closing reflection. Minor telling in traits slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain impeccable: flake projection to tree panel to platform activation culminates in on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (sits as guardian, stairway fades). Closure cost legible in "stairway faded with full sunrise... leaving him with unclaimed throne." Orientation anchored immediately; single scene holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like "bark that resembled circuit boards" and "nano-pigments" constrain path and charge final dawn-mirrored waterfall image. Futuristic nostalgia filters perception selectively. Sensory integration woven into action elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stairway before sunrise) tightens causally via discoveries narrowing options; time pressure forces sprint. Agency in insertions/activations; cost felt in fading opportunity. Minor abstractness in throne power keeps under 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation over power emerges organically via particulars (murals of lost glory, nostalgia for "civilization that built it"); final image resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Nostalgia reweights quest premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lore-keeper perceptual bias (texts, murals); rhythmic prose modulates tension ("ground trembled as stairway rose"). No dialogue; minor compression lapses in transitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in action-integrated imagery; rhythm varies with propulsion ("sprinted to center"). Minor paraphrase loops ("peeling paint layers" x2, "carefully peeled") dock score; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest trope via paint-peel mechanics and futuristic nostalgia; throne as memory-preserver transforms archetype. Risk in holographic/nano details feels organic, heightens stakes.</comment>
