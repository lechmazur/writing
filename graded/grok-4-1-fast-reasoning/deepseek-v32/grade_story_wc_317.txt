<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Told traits like "notably receptive" and "orthogonal approaches" dominate over shown micro-choices or embodied conflict; motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority summarizes epiphanies ("pieces flowed together") without concrete particularity. Final purpose surge feels unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via packages/research to CR closure (seed as metaphor reweights threat to opportunity) with conceptual cost legible in plaque realization. Orientation anchored early (Elara, haven, brook). Minor and-then sequencing and unmotivated package arrivals prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid via "storm-born silence" and brook mirroring thoughts, charging final image. Sensory selective (auditory hush dominant) reflects POV priorities. Lacks constraint on choices (brook guides walk but not tactics); repetitive motifs border ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect haven/innovation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via map/plaque to agency-driven revelation. Cost abstract (purpose surge vs. visceral loss). Pressure coheres but stays low-visceral; no live trade-off narrows options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (protecting innovation as rare "seeds") emerges via events/metaphor shift, resonant in final desk image. Subtext in puzzle-activism merge avoids overt morals mostly. Explicit summation ("symbolized the growth of hidden potentials") borders thematic echo, flattening ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent lyrical texture; perceptual bias toward brook/silence character-specific. No dialogue to judge. Repetitive phrasing erodes distinct rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("quiet brook" x6, "storm-born silence"/"hush" repeats x4+); template cadence in descriptive runs dulls propulsion. Synonym churn ("possibility just born" x3) and overwriting obscure cause/effect in peak revelation. Artifacts pervade final third, harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape room + corpse flower as conservation puzzle; orthogonal activism angle transforms tropes organically. Risk in poetic repetition heightens tone without gimmickry. Prose artifacts limit distinction.</comment>
