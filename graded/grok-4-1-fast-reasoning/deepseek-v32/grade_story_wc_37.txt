<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional: Elara's fragmentation creates contradictory impulses (solo hesitant hum vs. need for chorus), earning unification at climax where scattered self draws together via song, with perpetual watch as felt cost. Interiority concrete in translucent hands and pulsing stone. Minor abstraction in "profound comfort" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: solo hum builds density to chorus swell, tightening to light cascade as RR/Charged Poise. Closure on-page with cost in "decay halted" but "kept watch... each day... sing." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mica window constrains choices (glimpses salvation, channels power) and charges final image ("turned slowly within the mica"). Sensory details (cool surface, faint pulse) selective via Elara's bias; greenhouse evolves causally (plants straighten, fruits swell).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from fragmented voice to unified chorus narrowing options (needs echoes). Climax agency in channeling yields visible cost (ongoing vigilance forecloses solitude). One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared glow over single flame emerges organically via memory-fruits to chorus to final image ("crafted light" on "canvas" of night), reweighting premise without moral. Resonance in "not rekindled by a single flame" ties arc inextricably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (whisper between silvered leaves, translucent hands). Rhythmic prose modulates from hesitant to swelling chorus. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "golden threads and rosy filaments" purposeful and pattern-taught early, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs (e.g., "intricate tapestries... frayed") doesn't dull climax cascade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-fruits releasing glow (not contents) to knit echoes transforms unity trope via alchemical logic. Risky lyric fantasy risks obscuring but heightens closure image; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
