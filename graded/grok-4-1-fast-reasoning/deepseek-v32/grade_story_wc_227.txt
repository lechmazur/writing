<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lev's uncertainty embodied in trembling hands transitions convincingly to "enchanted certainty," with micro-choices like precise charm placements revealing motive hierarchy; internal conflict subtle but present in compelled narration under dissolving threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density building to CR closure—"clutching the mended history... terrible, enchanted certainty"—with legible cost in workshop's dissolution; orientation anchored early, one tightening via accelerating revelations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating workshop and acid sea constrain choices, culminating in "gear shearing off" that charges final image; sensory hierarchy (hiss, ozone, spray) filtered through alchemical urgency, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend history) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through charm placements narrowing to final heart-fit amid surging sea; agency in narration forecloses oblivion path with workshop-loss cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi/quilting theme emerges organically from gold threads mending memories, resonant non-literal answer in "broken history... more beautiful and whole"; no moralizing, complexity in sacrifice vs. catastrophe reweighted at end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with alchemical perceptual signature ("kintsugi intentions made manifest"); rhythmic texture modulates urgency, purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density borders overwrought in peak ("gold threads... blazed, and the core concept... fulfilled"); no loops or scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pockmark-matching as memory-map ingeniously transforms repair trope into dire alchemical rite; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative synthesis feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
