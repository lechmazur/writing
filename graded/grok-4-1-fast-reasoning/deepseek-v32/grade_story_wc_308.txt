<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to navigate without moving intensifies compellingly through micro-choices like holding arrowhead to forehead and skimming bone, earning final endurance; interiority concrete in resonance-sensing. Minimal shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits 9+; no slips touch closure stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with resonance density building to RR closure ("The wandering pulse settled... becoming part of the canyon's permanent voice"); cost legible in unfinished note's eons-long rest across stillness. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and dust constrain skimming choice and charge final image ("echoes... holding a finished song"); sensory hierarchy (hum, pulse, swirl) reflects skimmer's bias. Environment evolves causally with harmony amplification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (true appraisal syncing to harmony) deepens via flock revelation and skimming under accumulative lens, narrowing to stillness-agency; cost felt in lost destination's conceptual foreclosure ("place was gone"). Single tightening sufficient but lacks overt trade-off visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-navigation emerges organically from pulse-flock-bone alignment, reweighting premise in final image ("stillness... contains every journey") without moralizing; resonant CR with conceptual cost of buried song's restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in resonance diction ("trace the resonance," "skim... resonance over resonance"); rhythmic control heightens textural build to charged poise, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("fingers, whispering against the bone tower, drew out a low... hum"); varied rhythm, no loops or muddled figures (e.g., "slice time" purposeful). Zero artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harmonic fantasy via tuning-arrowhead and stillness-navigation transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from Ero's resolve to canyon chord.</comment>
