<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor histories drives precise micro-choices like knotting the moth wing, with embodied emotion in feeling the world's skipped beat; minor slip in label-speak "This symbolism pleased her esoteric realism" abstracts rather than shows contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in "She untied one final knot, letting the structure loosen," reconfiguring impermanence with legible conceptual cost; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (mist, moss, blushing warmth) filters through Elara's priorities, with grotto constraining observation and charging final butterfly/structure interaction; recurring ledge placement subtly guides choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring fading migration tightens via textural cadence shift as butterfly hesitates/approaches/alights, forcing Elara's endurance with visible cost in structure's shimmer and later loosening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transient honors emerges organically from wing knots and butterfly's pause, with final untying offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting permanence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in esoteric noticing (wing iridescence bridging day/night); rhythmic modulation peaks fluidly in building beats, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif repetition ("blushing stillness") taught early for propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on "transient" concepts deduct lightly, rhythm varies without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of esoteric realism in signaling extinct migrations via knots transforms extinction trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
