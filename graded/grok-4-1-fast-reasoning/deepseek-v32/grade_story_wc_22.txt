<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel sacrifice of all seed pods at climax; interiority concrete via ritual beliefs and bird translation. Internal conflict subtle—resolute crusade with no shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance earned by prior habits, foreclosing future plantings with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine seeding to agitated birds signaling concord discovery, culminating in on-page RR (Charged Poise) as glow pulses and shoots emerge after ritual. Cost legible in "emptied his entire collection," reconfiguring reclamation from narrow to vast. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in jetty routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty and toxic sea constrain choices (follow birds to end for concord); phosphorescent pillar and peat shoots charge final image, mirroring internal reclamation. Sensory details selective (luminous primroses, rattling pods, bird trills) through POV bias of gardener-interpreter. Evolving environment (glow intensifies, shoots march) ties to action without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclamation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via birds' agitation narrowing to concord ritual, forcing trade-off of all pods. Escalation driven by Arrin's agency in interpreting/following birds; cost unmistakable in emptied collection altering future tactics. Coherent pressure reweights to vast covenant remembrance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten covenants reclaiming ruin emerges organically from ritual acts, seed offering, and land-sea pillar; final shoots marching inland reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of war-erasure. Resonance from particulars like dead-language chant and bird hymns avoids morals. Protagonist arc inextricable from memory-as-growth question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (dead tongues coaxing life, avian diagnosis); rhythmic prose modulates from observational to ritual intensity. Distinct mythic texture in syntax/word choice fits interpreter's mind; no dialogue, no issues. Diction stays within lexicon, elision purposeful for lyric build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "crushed it in his palm, and mix its dust"); rhythm varies for ear, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opener purposeful for tone, not muddling peak ritual. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war gardener using extinct languages/bird calls/reef pillar transforms reclamation trope; ritual emptying pods feels inevitable from established eccentricities. Bold mythic-postapoc angle risks lyrical compression but heightens stakes coherently. Non-obvious concordance of land-sea covenant inflects turns organically.</comment>
