<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied resonance with music and contradictory regret/justice impulses; final peace earned through causal reflection chain. Minor slip in epiphany's "profound sadness" feeling slightly diagnostic without deeper contradiction mid-revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from crank turn to swelling music/memory waves culminating in CR (betrayal as relief) with legible emotional cost in "hollow victory" reweighting. Single scene, orientation anchored in opening lines; closure image of crank pulsing seals reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory filter (sepia tones, amber shadows, scratchy melody) through regretful POV; crank as micro-setting constrains musing and charges final placement. Repetitive shadow motif purposeful but borders ornamental in non-pivotal lines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth of smile) signaled early, escalates via music's "standing waves coalescing into presence" tightening intuition under accumulative lens, forcing realization with felt cost of prior "cold resolve" reframed. One deepening sufficient; agency in cranking/musing forecloses haunted path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of liberation-through-destruction emerges organically from music/memory particulars, final CR reweights betrayal without moralizing. Resonant image of "golden shadows within him" answers premise non-literally; ambiguity in Thorne's relief lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (shadows as shroud/regret); rhythmic poetic texture modulates to contemplative cadence at revelation. No dialogue; purposeful compression in memory shards taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but overwriting artifacts in revelation ("bridge of intuition tightened...coalesce into palpable presence") mix metaphors and stack figures, dulling peak clarity; minor paraphrase loops on "shadows" and "silence." No loops touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gramophone waves as redemptive conduit transforms betrayal trope; risky lyric accumulative risks poetic excess but heightens resonance. "Standing waves" method inflects originality without gimmickry.</comment>
