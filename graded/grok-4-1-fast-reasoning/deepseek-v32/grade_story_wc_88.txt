<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between hollow detachment and faint motivation to kindle empathy, embodied in crossroads hesitation at lake's edge; earned change via dive forecloses forgetting with felt guilt surge. Minor diagnostic slips like "complex tapestry of human frailty" slightly abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: newspaper cue accumulates to descent shards, tightening via memory bubble into RR closure (emergence with empathy spark, cost in "heart heavier yet lighter"). Orientation anchored early (post-procedure Leo in cafe); one meaningful deepening at dive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lake glow constrains dive choice and charges final image as soul mirror; tactile descent (damp air, flashlight) filters through jaded POV. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under pressure, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragments/descent to agency-driven dive narrowing options; cost legible in memory torrent and heavier heart. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of confrontation over erasure emerges organically from wipe-to-dive arc, resonant in baseball's shift to compass without moralizing; final image reweights forgetting's premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (jaded wonder in reflections); rhythmic texture modulates descent intensity. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Density high but paraphrase loops ("labyrinth of choices," "delicately robust" echoes) and metaphor density dull minor beats; template cadence in memory surge ("He saw..."). Closure image clear despite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory wipe, time-traveler relic, biolum lake transforms clean-slate trope; risk in lyric shards pays off at empathetic reconfiguration.</comment>
