<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve moments roots choices like deliberate brush strokes; embodied warmth from locket adds specificity, but diagnostic labels like "haunted euphoria" undercut contradictory impulses in peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of observations builds to pattern break at locket shimmer ("the photo showed not just her sister, but the jetty as it was now"), delivering Charged Poise closure with legible bittersweet cost; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains via twilight changes that trigger glow and sustain magic ("her action of coming here each twilight was what sustained the magic"), charging final image; sensory details selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant preservation stake signaled early tightens accumulatively when glow responds to memories ("the glow responded to her memories"), deepening to catalyst realization with on-page ache cost; agency in documenting forecloses passive loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of preservation reviving memories emerges organically via locket merge and vow; final image ("the jetty bloomed forever in her archives") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "proximate causes" and "steeping"; rhythmic modulation fits archivist voice, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn around "regenerated covenant" and "gently thorough" (multiple restatements in final third) dull density; template cadence in descriptive runs obscures propulsion near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh magical realism angle transforms memory trope via archivist's proximate causes method; walnut ink and responsive glow feel organic synthesis, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
