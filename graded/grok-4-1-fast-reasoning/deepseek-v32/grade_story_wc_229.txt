<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation rooted in "stubborn stone" and her teaching compels the ritual choice with embodied tenderness; internal conflict in "screaming tenderness" acts simultaneously. Final endurance as sentinel earns change with exhaustion cost. Keeper's dawning nod reveals relational crucible without headcount penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from climb to hum/ship safety; closure as Charged Poise in "quiet hum of completion" with felt exhaustion cost on-page. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (tower climb post-heat). Single scene holds lens cleanly to CR of whispers>shouts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt tower and vial cork constrain ritual focus, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (scent over sight/sound) mirrors POV urgency. "Jasmine and damp earth" evolves causally with fog/ship. Micro-setting (console/cork) alters tactics indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers) signaled early tightens accumulatively via scent-ritual deepening, narrowing to heartbeat pulse. Agency in memory-conduit forecloses shout-path with exhaustion price legible in descent. Captain's turn tests commitment under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges via particulars: cork/scent reweights shouts to whispers in Keeper's "No... Just a whisper." Final image (gilded smack) offers non-literal answer with lingering ambiguity. No moralizing; irony in unseen gap charges resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited with perceptual bias (scent/vibration over glare); diction/rhythm modulate from "gasping and slick" to quiet hum. Voice texture distinct in "screaming tenderness." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "shimmer with it" does sensory/emotion/pressure); rhythm varies for propulsion without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language pattern-taught early pays off at hum without muddle. Closure image crisp, no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: supernatural guidance via purified vibration/scent transforms lighthouse trope organically. Risk in eschewing beam for whisper charges stakes uniquely. Hindsight inevitability in smack's passage from cork's reprise.</comment>
