<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Watchful dye master's traits root motivation in light observation, with heart thump as embodied signal compelling tilt-wing choice; final descent decision earned by patient tracking, though internal conflict leans reflective over contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from wing/sun trails to matching pattern revelation; closure as Charged Poise in pocketing wing and dawn commitment reconfigures options with responsibility cost, legible in "profound responsibility to listen."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sun trails tracked on floor and morpho wing constrain choices, charging final alignment image; floating tea house and mist anchor perceptual bias of dye master without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decipher heart's pull tightens via wing-tilt revelation matching trails, narrowing to descent agency; cost felt in foreclosed passivity and reciprocal grace burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of attention magnetizing stories emerges from light patterns and heart impulse, resonant non-literal answer in "catch the light at a necessary angle" reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-as-conversation diction and syntax modulation; stable close third-person POV with dye-master bias, rhythmic control heightens quiet revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful iridescent metaphors taught early avoids muddle, propulsion via varied rhythm; minor figurative density in reflection ("iridescent caution... directive") borders overwrite but serves voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of donor-heart narrative memory and wing-as-light-map projector feels inevitable; risk in lyric light-tracking payoff transforms transplant trope organically.</comment>
