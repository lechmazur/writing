<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in exile/traits, intensifying to compel preparation; interiority concrete via worry stone embodiment and chess logic. Contradictory impulses (melancholy vs. hope) layer realistically but via summary over simultaneous action. Final stance earned by causal buildup of patterns; no unmotivated leap at "He stood, holding the basalt stone."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from pulses/minerals to pattern/seals correlation, tightening toward gambit plan. Charged Poise closure on-page ("Then, he began the careful work") with legible cost ("succeed or be consumed"). Orientation anchored early (first para); single scene holds lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nexus twilight vivid/selective (humming air, tremors, stellar charts), mirroring internal distress; worry stone as micro-setting grounds focus, constrains racing thoughts via tactile handling. Charges final image ("holding the basalt stone") without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (magnetic spikes as covenant dates).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore covenant pre-phase) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via recurring pattern discovery forcing recalibration gambit. Agency in precise mapping/translation forecloses inaction with felt risk/cost ("chaotic forces," consumption). Escalation coheres under lens, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (beauty/harmony in silence) emerges organically from correlation acts/images, not statement; final image reconfigures premise via "translating silence into light." Resonance from particulars (stone dent as hollow to fill) with lingering ambiguity (fragile hope). No moralizing; counter-readings plausible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (chess precision on pulses/birds); diction/rhythm purposeful but repetitive under low stress. No head-hopping; voice modulates slightly to charged poise at end. Texture distinct via geometric/seal motifs, legible elision of mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops/synonym churn ("correlate" x10+, "silence/quiet/gaps/whispers" restatements across paras, "hope/melancholy/fragile" churn) dull propulsion, obscuring escalation density. Template cadence in reflections ("He [action], [trait]"); artifacts pervade final third/closure ("worry stone" reprise redundant). Density low despite vivid images; rhythm varies minimally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess tutor decodes ley-line silence at nexus for covenant gambit transforms fantasy tropes via precise, melancholy logic. Risky Accumulative quiet ending heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars (basalt dent, stellar-magnetic correlation) feel inevitable.</comment>
