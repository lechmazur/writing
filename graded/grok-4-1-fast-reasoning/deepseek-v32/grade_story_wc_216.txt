<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand time's texture drives consistent micro-choices like garage sale codes and urn insertion, with embodied timelessness ("cold and sharp") revealing internal conflict. Final change to curator feels earned via accumulative discoveries. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragments to hologram map to cache visit, culminating in CR closure ("collective breath of memory") with conceptual cost of shifting from isolation to curation. Orientation anchored early in silo. One tightening via urn as physical key suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald silo's "translucent green mineral" and "aquatic gloom" constrain secrecy and charge discoveries; cache under oak and urn's warmth evolve tactilely, mirroring internal states. Recurrent fragments guide choices without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (urn, console) charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand time's texture) signaled early, tightens texturally via garage replies and cache flood of sunset feel, narrowing to collective curation. Agency in coded listings and shard insertion; cost legible in "adrift in a moment without measure." No reversal required for lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as felt texture emerges via particulars like "music box that plays the sound of forgotten hours" and sunset imprint, reweighted in CR ending without moralizing. Subtext in coded queries invites shared memory. Final image offers resonant answer to premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias toward time's "vague texture"; diction like "chronological essence" fits lyric mode, modulating rhythmically. No head-hopping or elision withholding. Voice texture distinct and pressure-tuned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("leaking chronological essence") integrated into action; rhythm varies, propulsion strong in descent ("air felt thinner"). Minor density slip in descriptive clusters ("anticipated mysteries") dings without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Shift time textures via garage codes and urn memories transforms tropes organically. Risky mosaic shards heighten ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight at cache realization. No derivative echoes.</comment>
