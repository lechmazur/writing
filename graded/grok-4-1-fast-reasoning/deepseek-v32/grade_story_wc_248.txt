<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra's analytically intuitive trait and volcanic tenderness drive consistent choices from arson to curation; internal conflict between destruction and salvation peaks in the diorama glow, earning the final resolve with guilt's felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds impeccably—fragment from fire leads to archive, portrait vandalism conceals map to diorama—with on-page closure as Decisive Change in Ezra's art-trail decision, cost legible in abandoned-world forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains via mosaic path guiding to vandalized portrait and forgotten passage; diorama's glow charges final image, sensory details (cool air, waterfall) mirror emotional thaw without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rescue promise escalates causally through portrait/map tightening to diorama revelation; agency in deciphering forces art-trail renunciation of broadcast, with visible cost in perpetual guardianship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of destructive tenderness emerges organically via fire prelude to green salvation; final image of art trail reconfigures arson as redemption without moralizing, resonant counter-reading in curator's isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (patterns in chaos, art as chapters); voice texture modulates poetically from "volcanic heat" to "cooled lava," rhythmic control heightens pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated image-action ("peeled back a loosened shred"); minor tenderness recurrence purposeful for theme, no loops dulling closure; rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vandalized portrait as map-concealment twist transforms trope of lost archive into fresh salvation via art; risk in arsonist-curator arc feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
