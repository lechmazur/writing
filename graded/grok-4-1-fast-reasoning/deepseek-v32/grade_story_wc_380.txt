<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation to recover memories drives consistent micro-choices like coffee readings and cave venture, with embodied loss in trembling hands and brittle flowers; internal persistence amid chaos earns wholeness without epiphanic overreach. Contradictory impulses surface in persisting through chaotic grounds despite prior fevers' theft. Final placement of flowers on pedestal forecloses pure recovery with felt cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush and gravity pockets build density to coffee vision shard, tightening to cave climax; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page when Arlo grasps whale's delivery, reweighting memories as crystallized layers with conceptual cost of hidden waiting. Orientation anchors early (Arlo at docks post-beaching). Persistent gravity constraint shapes path and chamber payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geothermal cave's floating crystals constrain Arlo's tapping action and charge final whirlwind image; black sands, fluctuating ropes filter via dock-hand bias. Sensory hush seeps tactilely into bones, mirroring internal void. Environment evolves causally from shore pockets to stabilized patterns, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via vision-forced cave trek amid gravity perils, narrowing options; agency in exhuming via flowers yields Charged Poise with interred blooms as felt cost. No reversal overload, but pressure coheres to reweight wholeness against prior emptiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memories sinking into hidden layers emerges via whale delivery and crystal vignettes, reweighting premise in final calm-sea grounds without moralizing; flowers motif shifts from brittle ghosts to interred crystal, charging closure non-literally. Satisfies 9+ test with resonant answer to "where deleted memories go."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeking (grounds, crystals); lyrical diction modulates from hush absorption to whirlwind release without register drift. Rhythmic compression heightens chamber pulse, satisfying 9+ test; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "mist coalesced into scenes" advances plot, evokes theme); "gleaming silence" motif recurs purposefully without loop. Varied syntax breathes with scene urgency, zero artifacts dulling closure image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whale-beaching as memory delivery via gravity-fluctuating crystals transforms tropes organically; cave exhuming grows inevitably from coffee patterns, with risk-taking in surreal physics heightening stakes coherently. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
