<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to collect wall stories intensifies credibly into recalibration, shown through embodied disorientation ("floor tilted") and micro-choice to fix tapestry; minimal internal contradiction limits to very strong, but final endurance earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density to CR closure in final image ("faint, reverberating pattern of a dragon's wing") reconfiguring inner north with conceptual cost of persistent quiet; orientation anchored early in silo library; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silo's spiraling shelves and sub-chamber fireplace constrain probing choices and charge final keystone act of fixing tapestry to central column; sensory coolness/paper smell filters through perceptive bias, evolving with discoveries without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of probing expectant silence tightens accumulatively via diaries/tapestry deepening knowledge of displacement, forcing recalibration agency; cost felt in disorientation and foreclosed refuge view, but abstract world stakes slightly dilute on-page visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Displaced axis theme emerges organically from particulars (diary line "axis is slipping," psychic sky), reweighted non-literally in ending weave with lingering ambiguity of "it was a start"; no moralizing, resonant aftereffect from myth retreat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in silence textures ("weight of silence in different textures"); rhythmic poetic diction modulates intensity without drift, purposeful compression taught early via "bronze quiet."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("fingers brushed the cold wall") with rhythm varying openings; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("wings folded over a cracked city") during realization beat nudges down, but no loops or scaffold dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream silo as story-anchor with psychic tapestry guardians transforms myth/post-apoc tropes organically; risk-taking in CR ending inevitable from particulars, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
