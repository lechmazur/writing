<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in vow and singular pursuit intensifies through embodied anguish, with micro-choices like abrupt memory shifts revealing contradictory impulses. Earned change from innocence to wisdom forecloses naivety with felt cost. Minor diagnostic label-speak like "anguished joy" slightly abstracts peak reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from ritual hum to archive breathing and visions tightening to CR closure; pagoda's unpredictable response shapes tactics persistently. Orientation anchored early at entrance. Cost legible in "knowledge comes with a cost. Her innocence... imprisoned."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like pulsating walls and pagoda beams mirror internal chaos, constraining choices via emotional resonance. Pagoda as micro-setting charges final silent image. Sensory hierarchy fits historian POV without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to purify via resonance signaled early, escalates accumulatively through intensifying light and visions narrowing mental options. Agency in adapting patterns shows trade-off cost of innocence. One decisive deepening at energy surge suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia's binding/purifying duality emerges organically from ritual events and visions. Final image reconfigures pain to hope non-literally. Repetitive assertions like "anguished joy remained, but... purified" verge on echo, flattening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in lore-tinged noticing; syntax modulates from descriptive to intense. No head-hopping or withholding. Minor convergence in repetitive reflective phrasing under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("steadily unpredictable," "atoms of nostalgia," "anguished joy," "end of innocence") create paraphrase churn across ending, dulling closure image; template cadence in reflective blocks. Density varies but scaffold drags momentum. Minor register elevation in epiphanies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia particles and pattern-avoidance ritual transforms forbidden knowledge trope organically. Bold conceptual premise with irreplaceable pagoda logic. Risk in unpredictable mechanics heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
