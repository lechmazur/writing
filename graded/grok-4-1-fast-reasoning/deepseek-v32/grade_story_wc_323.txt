<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aris's contradictory impulses—obsession with lost past versus embrace of alien future—act in scene through teaching shift and final palm-held link, earning change with felt generational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as diagram density builds to CR closure ("the link was not an end point, but the first point"); orientation anchored early in Thalassia; cost legible in final image of submerged stars as promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anchor chain link as micro-setting constrains thought (tactile anchor for racing mind) and charges final image, contrasting cold iron with radiant model; benthic damp air and water-integrated geometry vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (starlight mastery) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via diagram layers narrowing past-focus options; agency in study/teaching forecloses exile stasis with conceptual cost in "melancholy awe."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of submerged loss unfolding to cosmic promise emerges organically from chain-to-geometry progression; final image reweights premise non-literally as "new kind of voyage," lingering without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward topological edges and lost specks; rhythmic modulation heightens wonder in "flower blooming in reverse"; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (varying sentences evoke unfolding); no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion; "somber marvel" repetition voice-motivated, not artifact; figurative coherence in folds/vertices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aliens' topological star charts synthesize submergence trope into fresh edge-geometry navigation; risk of lyric cosmology pays off in hindsight-inevitable CR, heightening stakes via mind-expansion.</comment>
