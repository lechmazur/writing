<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Collective "we" motivation rooted in survival trust intensifies credibly through doubt at fading messages; Mara's bell-ringing embodies emerging agency without unearned epiphany. Final self-reliance renunciation earns closure cost via prior obedience. No individuated interior contradictions, but scope-appropriate for communal POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: message shards build pattern to nebula revelation and ghost's fade; CR closure lands via final sidewalk note reconfiguring dependency with self-trust cost. Orientation anchored early in Arbos/orchard/ghost messages. Mosaic transitions legible, one deepening at "you are the gardeners now."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain summit climb and form gateway, charging final stable image; garden/bell/butterflies tactilely mirror hope revival. Sensory details (chalk crumbling, bell vibrating soil) selective via communal urgency. Nebula evolution ties to labor, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal land via trust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through fading messages/doubt forcing self-reliance stance; cost legible in exchanged dependency. One reversal at final note forecloses ghost reliance. Agency collective, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of earned collective hope emerges via garden/arches progression to self-guidance, resonant CR without statement; brambled doubt yields nebula gleam non-literally. Complexity in trust ambiguity lingers. Final image reweights prior labor without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable "we" POV with collective perceptual bias (chalked words as trust anchors); voice texture poetic yet grounded, modulates from scarcity to stewardship. No head-hopping, purposeful lyric compression taught early via messages. Rhythmic control heightens revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bell tone "vibrated through soil and up stones"); rhythm varies, no loops/scaffold. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("kaleidoscope... living threads") purposeful for tone, not muddling closure. Clean propulsion to CR image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-orchestrated sci-fi communalism transforms tropes via chalk messages/butterfly revival; risk in plural POV/plural-time mosaic heightens stakes coherently. Inevitable hindsight from pattern to self-writing closure. No derivative templates.</comment>
