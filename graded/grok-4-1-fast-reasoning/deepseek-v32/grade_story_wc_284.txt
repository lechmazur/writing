<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: contradictory fear of spent courage and duty act simultaneously in trembling hands while decoding, earning final resolve to face Elara with relational cost. Minor slip: occasional diagnostic phrasing like "repair the trust he had shattered" borders on unembodied summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via layered memories/images to CR closure in "lay bare his burned and weary soul," reweighting premise with undeniable vulnerability cost legible in final thaw image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Snow patches constrain decoding choice and charge final green shoots image mirroring renewal; mist/zephyr filter Aris's thawing perception purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused courage to fix broken trust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through code interpretation narrowing to personal confrontation; agency in renunciation of hiding forecloses escape path with felt exposure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of courage-as-vulnerability emerges organically from pillbox/helix evolution and snow-code particulars; final image non-literally reconfigures "fixing what's broken" from network to empathy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (silver hush, mist echoes) biases toward introspective hush modulating with resolve; stable close-3rd distance enhances accumulative cadence without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting flaw: figurative density ("mist clung like forgotten secret," "world to mercury") pervades reflective beats without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion; "silver hush" loops thrice create mild paraphrase redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh inflection transforms burned-spy trope via internal codes-to-confession arc grounded in helix/pillbox synthesis; risk of lyric hush-tone heightens renewal stakes organically.</comment>
