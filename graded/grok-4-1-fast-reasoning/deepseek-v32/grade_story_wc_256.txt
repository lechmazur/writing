<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but interiority relies on abstract labels like "powerfully gentle touch"; lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, with realizations told rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure via symphony reconfiguring pilgrimage; cost legible in "felt the texture of connection as a physical sensation"; orientation anchored early, one tightening at chant overlay suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens and bells as micro-setting constrain discoveries (projection, cleaning) and charge final image; golden shadows recur purposefully through POV, filtering sensory hierarchy without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early with textural deepening at resonance cascade narrowing to synthesis; agency in alignments forces trade-off, cost felt in velvet-like sensation charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of woven connections emerges from particulars like light-chant overlay without statement; final tapestry image resonantly reweights premise, embracing ambiguity in perpetual journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (prism-song spectra); rhythmic modulation supports accumulative build, diction controlled and biased toward sound-light fusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in realizations ("artificial pilgrimage," "texture of connection") and repetitive motifs ("golden shadows," "propelled") across final third dull propulsion; density solid but overwriting in epiphanic beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh prism-song/light-sound synthesis transforms archival trope organically; risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes toward beacon legacy without gimmickry.</comment>
