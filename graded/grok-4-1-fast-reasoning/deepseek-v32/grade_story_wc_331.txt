<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's sanely eccentric traits drive concrete micro-choices like ignoring patrons for the ritual, with contradictory detachment amid bustle shown embodied; final custodianship renunciation of overt pursuit feels earned via vision's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure in "understanding was now indelibly etched," reweighting her world with felt ongoing cost; orientation anchored early in library bustle, one ritual tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-Euclidean nook and hyperbolic curves constrain ritual choice and charge final scarf image; sensory details like whispering compass and warming fibers filter through Elara's priorities, evolving with memory vision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to access story-place tightens via ritual deepening that changes knowledge, under Accumulative lens; cost legible in vision's fade forcing poised endurance amid patrons.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of narrative curvature emerges via founder's hyperbolic proof, final library-as-gateway image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature blending science-poetry (e.g., "tactile archive"); rhythmic modulation heightens ritual shimmer without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from bustle to vision; no loops, purposeful figurative arcs like "resonant lens" cohere without muddle in peak memory beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as story-place transforms library trope; risk in analog memories pays off inevitably at etched realization.</comment>
