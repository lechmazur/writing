<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation intensifies credibly from public poetry to personal apology, with guilt's internal conflict embodied in fading mischief and raw voice at climax. Backstory anchors tilt present choices without drag. Minor telling in initial motivation; earned change at "I am sorry" seals strength.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry builds density via echoes, tightening to personal confrontation; RR closure in echoed apology reconfigures truth with relational cost on-page. Orientation anchored early in canyon/spires. No causality breaks; pivotal echoes transform words into multiplicity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echoes as setting constrain/enable poetry choices and charge final image of blended apologies. Sensory hierarchy (sound-dominant) reflects stakes; bone towers mirror fossilized relations. Vivid, purposeful integration avoids white-room; spire looms evolve with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via crowd/echoes to personal forgiveness price, narrowing to apology trade-off. Agency in sessions and raw plea forecloses defiance path with felt vulnerability. Cost legible in Elara's tear and changed silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth/forgiveness multiplicity emerges organically via echoed poetry/apology, with final "hundred forms" image resonating without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable; subtext in Elara confrontation invites ambiguity. Reweights prior sessions non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (mischievous to raw); diction/rhythm poetic yet character-bound to artist. Dialogue subtextual ("solemnity into chaos"); natural distinction in voices. No head-hopping; modulates with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with pressure (short raw apology amid echoes); high density in echo integrations. Minor figurative density ("echoes coiled like serpents") purposeful but borders overwrite in opening. No loops/artifacts; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echoing canyon refracts truth/poetry into personal forgiveness, transforming defiance trope via artist's guilt. Risky tone/poetic method heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight in "echoes made them complex."</comment>
