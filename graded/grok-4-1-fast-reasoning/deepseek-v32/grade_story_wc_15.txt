<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to weave reverence from ruin drives persistent choices, embodied in hands syncing with lost tides. Contradictory optimism amid loss shown through stubborn stitching despite silence. Final thread expenditure earns closure renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sleepwalking paths accumulate fragments to core chamber CR, reweighting ruin via stitched drop above fountain. Orientation anchored early in wharf weaver entering damp labyrinth. Cost legible in last thread and venerated absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Red canyon labyrinth constrains night-only trance paths, damp stone yields to thread like cloth. Final chamber fountain charges CR image. Sensory bias (moonlight glow on plate) mirrors poetic priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ruin to reverence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through core arrival narrowing to absence veneration. Agency in trance navigation and stitching forecloses restoration path. Visible cost in expended thread alters final tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stitching orchid solace rethreads broken precedents into sanctuary. Final drop-held-not-poured image resonantly reconfigures premise without moralizing. Particulars like high sea depiction anchor complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (mending stories over nets). Voice modulates rhythmically with trance intensity, syntax lyrical yet legible. No head-hopping; elisions (paths mechanics) taught early, paid in core reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in stitching beats. Purposeful lyric metaphors (thread sinking like cloth) taught early, no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor figurative density in openings but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sews stories into stone via trance paths transforms ruin trope into fresh CR sanctuary. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, bold non-causal drive heightens awe without gimmick.</comment>
