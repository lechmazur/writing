<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness and fractal precision create consistent traits that enable micro-choices like decoding the coin's topography, rooting motivation in her painterly limits without unearned epiphanies. Internal conflict emerges subtly in her singular drive amid rising demolition pressure, shown through reverent focus. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously in peak beats, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from book safe to coin-map to crafting ritual, culminating in CR closure where pigment extraction reconfigures library loss as preserved essence. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (hollowed trunk pre-dawn demolition). Cost legible in "thunderous crash" and final glance back as tree leans.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grove's growth rings and hexagonal panel constrain precise tracings, charging final image of leaning tree against cradled clay jar. Sensory hierarchy (tactile over visual for her blindness) filters details purposefully. Micro-setting (candle-flamed coin) evolves with actions, mirroring internal precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (extract sky pigment) signaled early tightens via successive discoveries under demolition clock, narrowing options to ritual crafting. Agency in pressure sequences (coin raking, knot presses) forecloses delay paths with felt time cost. One deepening suffices; minor abstractness in initial commission caps from 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual/artistic limits emerges organically from coin's "universe" and pigment pulling "light from the room," reweighting destruction in final "fragment of sky made solid." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like tactile folio. Protagonist arc inextricable from guild wisdom's oblique cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature: fractal geometry in "cheekbone's curve" biases noticing, modulating to urgent brevity under stress. Rhythmic control in ritual beats (ground, measured, mixed); purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly. No head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "blue so profound it seemed to pull the very light" multi-task image/atmosphere/closure charge. Rhythm varies (short urgent sentences amid lyrical); no loops, coherent metaphors, zero artifacts in peak crafting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind fractal sight decoding coin-map in doomed tree-library transforms heist trope into alchemical preservation. Risky lyric compression heightens ingenuity without opacity; final CR feels inevitable from established precision constraints.</comment>
