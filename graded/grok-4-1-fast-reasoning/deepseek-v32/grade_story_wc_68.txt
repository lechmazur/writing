<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction between calm scrutiny and tectonic decision pressure acts simultaneously, earning the journey choice; micro-choices like cog placement reveal values under scout pressure. Final preservation act forecloses private study path with integration cost. Scout dialogue reveals her abrasive edge without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from cog narrative to machine beam RR (Charged Poise), reweighting preservation stake with conceptual cost in "true work... just beginning." Orientation anchored early in sewer post-plague; one tightening via scout intrusion narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sedimentary layers and bone-white ribs constrain journey choices and charge final chamber image, with sensory selection (harsh lanterns, clicked cog) filtered through Elara's meticulous bias. Setting evolves causally from dry pocket to archive without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant preservation stake tightens accumulatively via scout pressure forcing journey agency, culminating in beam that forecloses ignorance with felt awe cost on scouts. One deepening (archive discovery) narrows narrative options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge implicitly through cog scrutiny and resolve non-literally in interlocking cycles beam, reweighting surface simplicity without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to preservation question via luminous fact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited perceptual signature (grinding pressure of mind) biases details character-specifically; dialogue subtextual with scout scoff countered flatly. Rhythmic control modulates intensity without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short click sentence amid longer contemplations); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak (beam etching). Propulsion aligns with scene needs, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague ruins with cog-machine archive transforms preservation trope via precise ancient balance model. Risk in quiet awe closure heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
