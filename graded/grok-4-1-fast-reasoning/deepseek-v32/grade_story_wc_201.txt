<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene—body puppets trauma (root flail, gag reflex) while fragile psyche seeks mercy's math—earning final head-tilt observation with embodied cost of locked submission posture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: trauma-response density tightens through triggers to CR closure at pool, where reflection reconfigures trauma rule-set with conceptual cost of reobserved surrender physics; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>UV forest and enhanced body constrain choices (quantified movements, blistering pollen) and charge final pool image; selective sensory hierarchy (geometric data amid pain) mirrors internal fracture purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy's calculus vs trauma calculus) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via triggers forcing endurance, culminating in charged poise of tilted-head kneel with legible submission cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mercy's equation emerges organically from particulars (sap path, quantified grace posture), reweighting pain-premise in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer via conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (laboratory-precision proprioception, geometric quantification) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates with stress, stable close-third POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (multi-job lines integrate action/data/trauma); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (e.g., "cold tide pulling back"); zero loops or artifacts, even in peak pool beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive curse, UV penance ecology, mercy calculus transforms torture tropes; risk-taking in textured accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via body-forest crucible.</comment>
