<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation to "turn questions into destinations" roots choices consistently, with the mechanical arm embodied in fencing; Elara's parallel trait forces relational shift at card drop. Minor label-speak in "diplomatically fierce" slightly abstracts peak softening, but micro-choices like lowering blade earn the alliance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: waiting/decoding → duel → card drop → revelation → departure as Decisive Change; sundial cipher and token anchor orientation by para 2, with legible cost in renouncing duel. No orientation debt; closure reconfigures rivalry into journey with felt relational price on final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sundial constrains decoding choice and charges final purpose; atrium's vines/papers evoke "dignified chaos" mirroring duel, with brook as tactile witness. Selective sensory integration (gleam, chime, clatter) via POV bias; spatial choreography clear through circling/pivots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (philosophical divergence via duel/archive) tightens causally at card drop, narrowing from combat to alliance; agency in sheathing blades forecloses battle path with opportunity cost. Duel tests commitment before reversal; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of rivalry-to-shared-journey emerges via needle card reprise and sundial decode, reweighting "questions into destinations" in final exchange/image without moralizing. Subtext in softening glance and handed token carries ambiguity of unbroken "threads"; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Alistair with perceptual signature (angles into instructions, thumb on tin); dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing via "sundial's angles point northeast." Rhythmic modulation in duel (short chimes/lunges) vs. closure poise; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., arm flexes while assuming stance); rhythm varies (short parry sentences into longer reckonings), no loops beyond purposeful "dignified chaos" echoes. Minor scaffold in dual "diplomatically fierce" tags, but clarity/propulsion intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dueling philosophers decoding sundial for archive quest transforms trope via mechanical arm/token; risk in duel-to-journey pivot feels inevitable from cipher/motif groundwork. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual frame heightens stakes organically.</comment>
