<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via "shielded openness" and bone-felt pressure; motivation intensifies through patient stillness to earned renunciation of documentation, foreclosing the path of mending the map with felt conceptual cost. Contradictory impulses in seeking pattern yet embracing void shown in turning off gear and sitting still.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from video discrepancy to shadow breathing to ear pressure, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing where tear becomes sacred threshold, with undeniable conceptual cost in "map cannot be mended." Orientation anchored early (vault under henge, sodden spring); single scene holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault and breathing shadows constrain choices (needs saturation, barometric lull) and charge final moor ascent image. Sensory hierarchy (rain drumming, inner ear pressure) filtered through cartographer's perceptual bias; henge presses as tactile receiver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen chapel via silence interpretation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via algorithmic discrepancy to bone-listening endurance; agency in poised stillness forecloses documentation path. Cost legible in transient truth and unmended map, but pressure more textural than sharply narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathetic silence containing pilgrim echoes emerges organically from video shadows and held breath; final image reweights mapping premise non-literally via sacred tear, with lingering ambiguity of shared awe avoiding tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("map framer of lost intangibles," "guarded receptivity") biases noticing toward absences and resonances; rhythmic prose modulates from methodical to poised intensity without distance slips or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "shadow not present fifty years ago" advances multiple jobs); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, purposeful figures like "stone itself is breathing" cohere without muddle in peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography as intangibles framing with acoustic henge artifact; risk in lyric silence-concept transforms ghost tropes into climatic resonance, inevitable in hindsight via video method payoff.</comment>
