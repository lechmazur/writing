<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the retrocognitive struggle ("She fought the retrocognitive trap"), earning the renaming choice with embodied cost in calloused tracing and vision surrender. Interiority particularizes gentle radicalism without labels. Final endurance of council risk forecloses vulnerability path cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tessera visions accumulate density to CR closure at "She spoke the new name aloud, 'Khalish,'" reweighting mercy with conceptual cost (council deviation) via sky softening. Orientation anchored early in plaza/sky. No lens ambiguity; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone and tessera constrain renaming choice, charging final glow image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: ash-ozone air, prismatic glow mirror internal "warm coldness." Details tactile/integrated via kneeling/tracing; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (aberrant renaming) tightens accumulatively via vision deepening, forcing agency in tessera alignment with felt cost (trapped focus). Sky/principles shift charges poise, but abstract council pressure lacks on-page test. One reversal narrows to CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Renaming reconfigures mercy premise non-literally via "sheltered strength," resonant with plaza breathing image sans moralizing. Theme emerges organically from mosaic particulars, inviting counter-reading on council justice. No tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: mosaic as "language" biases noticing. Rhythmic control modulates in vision surge; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action ("aligned the tessera over a gap"); minor paraphrase loops on "warm coldness"/motivation motif (−0.5), but purposeful without obscuring CR image. Varied rhythm, clean syntax; no filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition/mosaic-renaming transforms post-fire tropes; "Khalish" turn inevitable from pattern. Bold conceptual premise commits fully, risking abstract stakes for ingenuity.</comment>
