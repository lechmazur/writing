<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in "certainties beginning to tremble" and embodied dread of failure propel the earned reconfiguration of assumptions at climax; minor label-speak like "sorrow in the deep blue fractures" slightly abstracts peak emotion without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from frustration to merged emotions; CR closure lands cleanly in "assumptions shatter... a river" with conceptual cost to distinct/catalogable theory, reweighting premise via sunbeam image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quartz arbor mist and frost patterns on car window constrain choices (diffused light forces retreat/method shift) and charge final image; selective sensory filter (hush, feathery frost) reflects mystic POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove absorption) tightens via pattern break in emotions from isolated to blended under Accumulative lens, with agency in prism-frost focus; sunbeam reversal forces trade-off in certainties, cost felt in shattered assumptions charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative meaning ("truthful lies") emerges organically from frost revelations without statement; final prism-melting frost image offers resonant CR repricing prior isolated emotions, embracing ambiguity over tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (hush between heartbeats, spectral emotions); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in ending, no head-hopping; distinct texture avoids generic mysticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("shifted hush," "firmly grounded") tying theme; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "shatter" phrasing slightly drag momentum but don't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic theory with frost-prism refraction transforms trope into specific, grounded revelation; risk in elusive CR closure ("solid and elusive") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
