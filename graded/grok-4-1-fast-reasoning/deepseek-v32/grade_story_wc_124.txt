<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silas's motivation roots deeply in consistent traits like aromatic caution and fear of chemical ghosts, culminating in an earned reconfiguration from terror to reverence for grief. Contradictory impulses—steady hands vs. wild heart—act simultaneously during the vial fracture. Final peace forecloses fear-based avoidance with embodied tear-cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from vial sigh to UV-shimmer reveal to memory scent, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure where grief reweights life's work. Orientation anchors instantly in greenhouse dusk. Vial's inner chamber tightens stakes on-page with persistent constraint of decayed expectations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains via volatile blooms and UV lamps that reveal vial seam, charging final "cathedral of faint blue lines." Sensory hierarchy (aromatic over visual) reflects Silas's bias. "Crystal shadows" evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock memory's grief mechanism—tightens accumulatively via empty puff reversal to amber drop, narrowing options from loss to revelation. Agency in tool-fracture and warming forces epiphany-cost (tears for lost boyhood). Escalation coheres under lens, entering 8.8+ via felt price charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memories as "emotional fossils" emerges organically from scent-events, reweighting premise in final image of empty vial as light-vessel. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; grief's "proof of love" answers central question non-literally. Satisfies 9+ test without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: notices "volatile blooms" and "chemical ghosts" via sensory bias. Lyrical rhythm modulates from cautious to reverent, with diction like "aromatic caution" reflecting mind. No elision issues; distinct texture under pressure satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "stopper released a sigh... cold, empty puff" advances plot/atmosphere/emotion). Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Final line recharges motifs cleanly, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct scents as soul-keys transforms trope of Proustian memory into botanical stakes. Vial's capillary seam and root-cellar reveal feel inevitable from greenhouse logic. Risky UV-crystal interplay heightens closure without gimmickry, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
