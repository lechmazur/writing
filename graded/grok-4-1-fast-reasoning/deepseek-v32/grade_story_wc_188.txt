<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to defy hopelessness is clear and embodied in chant, awareness, and craft choices; micro-choices like syncing to mosaic reveal values. Interiority concrete via pack weight and crowd sense, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from approach through setup to fireworks symphony shifting atmosphere. Closure as Charged Poise in crowd awe and temporary constellation reconfiguration legible with felt cost of char and departure. Orientation anchored early in path/fortress.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mosaic note and blooming stones constrain timing/respond to action, charging final pulsing image. Sensory hush, petals of light, dusk filter through Kael's awareness purposefully. No white-room; spatial courtyard coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake defying hopelessness signaled early, escalates accumulatively via awareness-adjusted plan and launch deepening crowd response. Agency in precise mixing/syncing forecloses failure path; cost in temporary shift unmistakable at cheers/echo fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of light defying darkness emerges organically from fireworks story against starless hush, reweighted in final constellation/beacon image without moralizing. Mosaic/chant particulars accumulate resonance; ambiguity in "just one night" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ambient awareness and chant rhythm; voice texture chant-like, modulating to louder guidance under pressure. No head-hopping; diction purposeful for craftsman, elision minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("filtered," "ambient awareness," "serious playfulness") and synonym churn on hopelessness create minor drag without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies with chant integration; density high but figurative density borders overwriting in prep beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks as hope defiance with mosaic sync and blooming fortress transforms tropes organically. Ingenuity in chant-melody timing and awareness crescendo feels inevitable; risks lyric tone without gimmick.</comment>
