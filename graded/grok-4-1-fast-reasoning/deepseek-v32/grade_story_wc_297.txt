<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's contradictory impulses—curiosity pulling against root pain—act simultaneously in the binding climax, earning his permanent anchorage with embodied cost in "New roots sprouted, weaving his flesh into the glade's tapestry."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as visions densify to materialize the intersection; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with legible cost in the clipping's dissolution and rooting, reconfiguring Silas's options permanently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's soil and dusk light constrain choices by tethering Silas's feet, charging the final image where "cobalt light remained, now steady and eternal"; sensory hierarchy reflects visionary bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to stabilize dreams escalates accumulatively via unstable vision tightening to self-binding agency; cost unmistakable in flesh-weaving roots foreclosing mobility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial balance emerges organically from scar linkages and binding; final image of new maze topiary reweights sacrifice as renewal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with visionary perceptual signature in scar-linked images; rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully from anxious buildup to serene poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but figurative density in peak vision beat ("shimmering knot of colors and whispers") borders overwrite, slightly dulling immediacy without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of root-binding and scar-networked dreams transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens inevitability of flesh-earth merger.</comment>
