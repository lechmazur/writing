<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory dread/awe impulses act in the grotto concentration beat, earning the release with embodied cost in her slumping exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to on-page CR in the unraveling, with cost legible in halo dimming and Elara's spent state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic grotto constrains the vision-channeling choice, charging the texture sensation in the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightens via maze-warped vision under accumulative lens, agency in pushing threads yields cost of total release and collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Weave sensation as final image resonantly reweights past grip through unraveled filaments, no moral stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in geometric/textural noticing; diction/rhythm controls climax pulse without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density propels unraveling ("rending silk" to "shimmering strands") with varied rhythm matching pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic time-weave synthesis risks bold geometry payoff, transforming maze trope inevitably at closure.</comment>
