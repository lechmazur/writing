<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: motivation to hear unheard stories drives micro-choices like candle-focus and tapestry-delivery with embodied contradiction (guise vs wisdom); minor flaw: interior conflict told more than shown simultaneously in pivotal stitching beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as embroidery density synchronizes possibilities to Charged Poise closure ("disaster averted"); cost legible in "guise of harmless eccentricity" foreclosing direct warning; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional: cobalt observatory and eternal candle constrain choices (illuminate threads, reveal variants) and charge final image ("flame danced, casting long shadows that looked like unraveling threads").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert coup via cipher) signaled early, escalates via one deepening (synchronized possibilities reveal "key conspirators"); agency in subtle delivery with felt cost (threat of being marked); fits accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through disguised wisdom emerges organically from embroidery cipher; resonant non-literal close in "whispered tale... in the right hands" reweights silence motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (stars as politics, threads as narratives); rhythmic control peaks in final image, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; flaw: minor loops ("echoed silence" x3, "unraveling"/"threads" churn) dull some mid-beats but spare closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery-as-cipher and adjacent possibilities transforms conspiracy trope; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes organically to inevitable close.</comment>
