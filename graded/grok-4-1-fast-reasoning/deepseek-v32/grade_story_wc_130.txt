<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in precise traits (math of emotion via fruits), with embodied grief (hollow variable) contradicting buried optimism, compelling micro-choices like correlating hues. Internal conflict acts in scene via suppressed ascent during study. Final task earned by causal buildup, foreclosing despair with her craft's cost. 9+ test met via contradictory impulses and earned closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mosaic scuff accumulates to aura via eyes, memory dovetail, fruit correlations, path charting, portal reveal as Charged Poise RR with imprisonment cost legible in "prisoner of his own beautiful experiment." Single scene causality links cleanly; orientation anchored early in orchard tending. No orientation debt. 9+ test met: closure on-page with cost, lens intact, constraint (emotional math) shapes tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern orchard specifics (glowing stone fruits, stalactite drip, mosaic chips, wall depressions) constrain choices (fruit hues for path, eyes placement for moonbeams) and charge portal image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (phosphorescent patterns as formulae). Micro-setting (mosaic, eyes) guides discovery to climax. 9+ test met: recurring fruits/mosaic constrain and recharge ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve ambiguous loss via emotional math) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via mosaic deepening to portal stasis, narrowing to bridge-building agency with felt cost (his "sublime imprisonment"). Pressure coheres under lens to Charged Poise. One decisive intensification suffices. 9+ test met: agency-driven escalation, unmistakable page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (navigating loss via emotion's math) emerges organically from mosaic formulae, fruit patterns, crystallized grove; final image reconfigures "ambiguous loss" to charged hope without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable. 9+ test met: non-literal ending answer reweights material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (emotional resonances as colors/formulae); diction/rhythm lyrical yet precise, modulating from quiet tending to urgent study. No dialogue. Voice reflects inventive mind (e.g., "calculus of the heart"). 9+ test met: distinct signature, rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax/rhythm propel from tending to portal without loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent (equations for feelings). Read-aloud natural; specifics replace generics (e.g., "phosphorescent patterns on the fruit skins"). No artifacts dull closure. 9+ test met: zero loops, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: taxidermy eyes decoding mosaic emotions to crystallized orchard transforms loss tropes via inventive math premise. Risky fantasy logic commits fully, inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; bold closure reweights. 9+ test met: non-obvious inevitability heightens stakes.</comment>
