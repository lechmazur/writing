<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—ruthless pragmatism vs. sentimental grief—act simultaneously in egg placement under storm pressure; final trade-worthiness earns stasis with self-trapping cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as crack-map and storm density converge on egg resonance; on-page CR in "fractured grace" echo reconfigures gamble with conceptual cost of entrapment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat's cracks constrain culvert discovery and egg socket, charging final pooling rain image; sensory hush mirrors internal silence-need.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to capture echo tightens via timed egg placement amid thunder build; agency forecloses valley for brief sound, cost felt in kneeling amid unabsorbed rain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Echo's "whisper of a billion wings" reweights premise as self-trap without moralizing; emerges organically from drought trade and faded grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature fixates on crack-cartography and wing-roar memory; rhythmic modulation peaks in thunderclap's "physical blow."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in "faint, multitudinous rustling, a whisper of a billion wings" propels climax; zero loops, varied syntax accelerates to charged poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fossil egg as storm-tuned resonator in drought silence synthesizes ecology-grief ingenuity; risks bold premise to inevitable, haunting payoff.</comment>
