<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elm's blithe cheer shifting to reverent focus feels earned through embodied tracing of threads and micro-choices under accumulating revelations; contradictory impulses (cheer vs. solemnity) surface in the silo's decoding without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via thread decodings to CR closure (final unity image reconfigures purpose with felt melancholic cost); orientation anchors early (Elm, cemetery to silo); lens clear by midpoint, cost legible in "surge of clarity" and rolled tapestry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt silo's cool stillness and starlit dust motes constrain decoding isolation and charge final image (silo as testament); sensory selection (whispers, motes) reflects Elm's reverent priorities without tourist catalog; recurring silo/stars evolve to mirror internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape of intentions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via black thread reversal (darker plot complicates to reconciliation), forcing stance crystallization; agency in persistent decoding endures with visible cost (blithe softened to reverence) charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of buried intentions mending via care emerges organically from thread mappings and reconciliatory artifact; final image (gardener/silo/stars as echo) offers non-literal resonance reweighting prior echoes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close sustains perceptual bias (echoes as voices, threads as lives); rhythmic texture modulates with intensity, but minor overwrought elevation drifts from Elm's grounded idiom in peak decoding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("velveteen gloom" x3, "chess clock" x3, "tenderly organized" x2, "uncharted echoes" x2) and paraphrase churn dull propulsion across descriptive runs; mixed metaphors (shadows as "soft fabric," gloom as "blanket") obscure clarity in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardener decoding reconciliatory tapestry transforms cemetery trope into protective legacy; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens quiet resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
