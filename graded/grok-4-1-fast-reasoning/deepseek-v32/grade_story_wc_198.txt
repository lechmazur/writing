<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy drives consistent choices like listening through negative space and pouring memories into the final note, with embodied emotion in breath and heartbeat sync. Lacks deeper internal contradiction or flaws complicating the climax play. Strong individual voice via silence-attuned perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jagged pauses to thrumming resonance, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration via the whisper note fracturing the code with felt cost in "poured his breath... memories." Orientation anchored early in plaza/atrium; shards (atrium to grotto) transition legibly. Closure cost legible in crystal dimming and earned hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist, dewdrops, and crystalline grotto constrain choices (hidden stairwell, central spire play) and charge final pulse in sync with heartbeat. Sensory hierarchy (negative space intervals over visuals) reflects Leo's priorities; vivid integration like "roots pierced crystalline ceiling" mirrors internal hush. Eerie nostalgia evolves causally with thrumming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush accelerating prophecy) signaled early, escalates via textural density (shortening pauses, projected images), deepening to saxophone counter-whisper narrowing noise option. Agency in final sustained note forecloses cacophony with poured-breath cost. One tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of countering noise via negative-space peace emerges organically from prophecy code, mist patterns, and final earned calm carrying "radiant grotto within." Resonant non-literal answer in smile and softer city sounds reweights hush from imposed to protected. Avoids moralizing; eerie nostalgia adds lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature attuned to silences and glows; voice texture in rhythmic phrases like "quietly vivid glow" modulates with rising thrumming. Elevated diction fits lyrical musician attuned to pauses. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful recurrence ("quietly vivid," mist) propels via varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked descriptors ("spectral ribbons") but coherent and voice-motivated. Closure image clear, read-aloud cadences breathe with hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sax-as-whisper countering coded prophecy in mist-crystal world transforms silence trope into tactile method. Risky negative-space play heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early gaps-listening to grotto climax.</comment>
