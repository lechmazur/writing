<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Kael's pause from duty to explore the goggles and diary, embodied in his "warmly inquisitive nature" driving micro-choices; final renunciation to hide the artifacts feels earned with emotional cost of shared loneliness. Interiority particular and concrete throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to CR closure in Kael's "newfound, quiet joy" and act of hiding artifacts, reweighting duty with legible cost of spire's loneliness in final image. Orientation anchored immediately; single scene tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurrent light beam and goggles constrain unlocking choice and charge final "scattered light still dancing" image; sensory details (frosted glass, dust motes) selectively POV-filtered and evolve with action. Micro-setting (elevator girder) guides hiding decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (duty vs. curiosity) signaled early, tightens via diary unlock that deepens kinship and forecloses mere delivery; cost felt in time pressure of chimes and accepted loneliness, charging final poise under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges organically from diary entries to Kael's realization, resonant in final "affectionate detachment" shielding loneliness without moralizing; image of diary waiting reweights prior isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in softened "liquid honey" world through goggles; rhythmic prose modulates beautifully with intensity, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion: varied syntax accelerates discovery beats; zero loops, purposeful metaphors (e.g., "needle of ice and iron") integrate without muddle, even in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk relic in transitional elevator space transforms discovery trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via light-puzzle unlock.</comment>
