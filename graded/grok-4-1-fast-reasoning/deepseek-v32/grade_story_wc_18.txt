<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation to capture dream rooted in pre-fog memory intensifies via ritual prep; embodied tension peaks in "pressure in her chest like a bird"; final capture earned without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to shimmer; RR closure in "dream settled into the mirror's surface" legible with fragility cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost and mirror constrain ritual choices; orchard ruins evolve to ghostly bloom in reflection, charging final image; sensory selection (shimmer prisms) POV-biased to light-bending craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens via breathing sync drawing dream; agency in sextant anchor forces boundary erasure; cost felt in "risk of shattering everything she knew."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection emerges via orchard/mirror shift; final constellation reweights lost sky without moral; subtext in glass-mountains fragility avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in light/fog noticing; rhythmic modulation builds ritual intensity; purposeful compression legible under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels to climax; minor figurative stack ("billion tiny prisms") fits tone but densities peak beat; no loops, varied rhythm reads aloud strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ritual fusing sextant/breathing/mirror transforms dream-capture trope; fresh angle on fog-bound loss via self-sync; risk in fragility heightens stakes organically.</comment>
