<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but interiority abstracts via repetitive summaries like "his motivation burned quietly"; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with final change feeling epiphanic rather than earned through embodied micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via patterned discoveries building to CR closure; orientation anchored early at station; "hidden compartment slid open" delivers legible conceptual cost in realization, with counting backwards linking beats causally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fjord mirroring sky and hydraulic details vivid and selective, reflecting quiet introspection; station and cliff perch guide observation but do not constrain pivotal choices like key insertion or counting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant intellectual stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through anomaly discoveries, narrowing understanding with agency-driven turns; cost legible in transformed perspective, but pressure lacks visceral trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of time as fluid/memory emerges from particulars like backwards ticking, resonating in final image without moralizing; repetitive "eminently peculiar" slightly overtens subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with selective perceptual signature on mechanisms/horizon; rhythmic motif repetition purposeful but borders monotony; no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Pervasive loops in "eminently peculiar" (x3), "squinted" (x4), "after blowing the whistle" (x4), and paraphrase redundancy dull propulsion; template cadence in action sentences like "Arin squinted/decided" triggers −0.6; artifacts persist into final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hydraulic clocks with razor gears and backwards mechanism synthesize fresh time philosophy angle; counting backwards turn transforms premise organically without gimmickry.</comment>
