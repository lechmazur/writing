<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Resilient positivity shown consistently through smiles and calm assurances amid phasing, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the merger climax; motivation clear but interiority leans declarative rather than embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density building to CR closure in "new timeline emerged, woven from the threads," reconfiguring stability as illusion with felt cost of endless cycles; orientation anchored early in grotto/ferry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Starlight pathways and grotto walls constrain choices like dial-tracing and hourglass-filling, charging final merged layers image; sensory integration vivid and purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to merge timelines tightens via resistance tug and unity pulse under Accumulative lens, narrowing to temporary stability; cost legible in "work never truly ended" at ferry reappearance with ghosts.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of permanent transient emerges organically from merger events, resonating in final "every merger was a moment, and every moment was a journey" without moralizing; ambiguity of stability lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward patterns; voice texture poetic and consistent, modulating rhythm for phasing intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops on "patterns" and "interconnected" in mid-beats dull propulsion slightly; rhythm varies well overall, but elevated diction borders overwrought in climax without artifacts touching closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sideways clocks, humming hourglass, and radio harmonics transforms timeline trope into inevitable permanent transient reconfiguration; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at closure.</comment>
