<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive labeling of "affectionate detachment" and stated motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy") dilute interior contradiction and embodiment; epiphany at "she had absorbed more than she intended" feels summarized rather than earned through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final lines ("peace that was neither counterfeit nor entirely true"); hesitation at "sensing... something was different" provides meaningful tightening with legible conceptual cost in blurred reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber grotto evolves from glowing dusk to breathing night, mirroring internal shift and charging final image ("amber grotto... witnessed her journey"); selective sensory details (static crackle, deepening hue) constrain perception without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (counterfeit to genuine fusion) signaled early and deepens via absorption hesitation, narrowing to renunciation of pure control; cost felt in "crossroads" moment forecloses detachment under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Half-truths emerge organically through petal absorption and final embrace, offering resonant answer ("a half truth, and that was enough") that reweights counterfeit premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (static sensing); rhythmic modulation supports accumulative texture, though minor repetition borders template cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("static electricity" x5+, "transformation completed" x4, "subsuming"/"half truths" churn) create template cadence across beats, dulling propulsion; artifacts pervade final third, obscuring closure image density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion alchemy via blotter petal and static sensing transforms dealer trope into insight-weaver arc; risk in poetic fantasy frame heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
