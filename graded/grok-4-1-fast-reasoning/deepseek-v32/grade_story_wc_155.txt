<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority relies on repeated diagnostic labels like "pensive mirth," flattening contradictory impulses; motivation drives actions but lacks embodied conflict at climax realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from fragment to murals; CR closure in sunlight on fragment reweights joy as remembered, with legible bittersweet cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog setting dynamically constrains and enables light-painting choices, charging final sunlight image; sensory details selective and purposeful through artist's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy tightens accumulatively via expanding murals and deepening communal memory; agency in projections forecloses total loss with fragile cost felt in fleeting fog images.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of joy stored in art/memory emerges organically from light images shifting to bittersweet renewal; final tree-of-light offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased toward light/memory; voice consistent but repetitive phrasing disrupts rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("pensive mirth," "knowledge network," "painted with light") and synonym churn pervade, dulling propulsion; artifacts touch closure beat, reducing density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-projections on fog and exposed-film memories transforms ruin trope; conceptual integrity in art-as-memory risks bold lyric accumulation.</comment>
