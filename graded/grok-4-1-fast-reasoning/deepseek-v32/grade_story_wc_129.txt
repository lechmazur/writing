<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's outsider yearning and sympathetic sensing drive consistent choices like proposing the search; strong micro-choice hierarchy in dedicating the discovery. Limited contradictory impulses shown in scene, mostly told via traits, slightly undercuts 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through search beats to RR Charged Poise in sculpture placement and embraced ache. Closure cost legible in "luminescent ache never fully faded"; one tightening via tag discovery coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain choices (search nooks, gathering announcement) and charge final image of sanctuary. Sensory details (pulsed light, prismatic shadows) selectively mirror internal ache through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shared search success forcing dedication trade-off. Agency in proposing search and announcing discovery; cost felt in faded tag's remnant loss charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kinship webs emerge organically from search particulars, reweighted in final sculpture mirroring tag without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in embraced ache avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (whispers of land, subtle energies). Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven (Kael's tag explanation advances plot); rhythmic prose modulates effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("webs of kinship," "luminescent ache") recur without full pattern payoff, dulling peak beats slightly. No closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fantasy orchard quest transforms outsider trope via tag's faded unity symbol. Fresh synthesis of reed art and lost languages feels organic; risk in lyrical ache tone heightens stakes.</comment>
