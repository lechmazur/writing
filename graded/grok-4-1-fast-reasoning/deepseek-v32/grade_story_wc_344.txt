<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength in locksmith skills aligning to eclipse lock and gear assembly, compelling the central choice; weakness in abstract "driftwood nostalgia" lacking embodied contradiction or simultaneous impulses during uncapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing via unified mirrors and thaw; on-page cost legible in "peace" after nostalgia reconfiguration, with persistent constraint of celestial rhythm shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen rime and mirrors constrain discovery and charge final unified reflection; selective frost/paper scents and infinite reflections filter through Arin's repair quest without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning repair signaled early escalates texturally via fragment/gears to uncapping, narrowing to harmony realization; protagonist agency in assembly forces trade-off with felt integration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of repair as balance emerges organically from mirrors/light; resonant non-literal answer in thaw/unified present, though "repair was not about returning" borders overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in celestial/frost diction modulates with intensity; stable third-limited POV with biased noticing of locks/gears; rhythmic compression heightens uncapping poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion without loops; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors like "breath painting ghosts" but consistent and voice-motivated; no scaffold dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith mending time via eclipse/gears/prophecy transforms tropes; risk in lyric fantasy frame heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
