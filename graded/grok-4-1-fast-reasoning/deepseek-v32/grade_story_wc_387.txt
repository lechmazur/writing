<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent traits shine in micro-choices like preparing tea before mending and whistling to engage fireflies, rooting motivation in embodied craft; internal serenity builds without stock epiphanies. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in pausing mends for witness. Philosophy feels earned through actions, not told, though archetypal wholeness limits to very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solitary ritual to firefly patterns mirroring net, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in "the patterns clarified: they were tracing the very mends in his net." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via whistle suffices. Cost felt in ephemeral dispersal, reweighting appreciation with quiet finality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moon paths and damp stone constrain whistling tactic and frame final glow; fireflies as micro-setting evolve with action, charging closure image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (patterns in flight, salt hands), integrated without stalls. Recurring ivy droplets and marsh mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciate hidden effort) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via whistle drawing fireflies into "slender, glowing rivers," narrowing to pattern revelation with agency in attention. Cost legible in forgotten mending and fading lights. Tightening coherent under lens, charging Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: net knots echo firefly signals and stone carving, culminating in resonant CR "Everything was connected by threads of unseen toil." No moralizing; ambiguity in ephemerality lingers. Final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature of pattern-seeking (e.g., "flight was not random; he perceived hidden patterns"). Rhythm modulates from ritual calm to deepening majesty. Compression purposeful, taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density advances atmosphere and revelation; rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in whistle beat). Minor overwrite in "scintillatingly somber" and pattern echoes purposeful under lens, not muddled. No loops obscure cause; propulsion clear to final tea stir.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mender's craft mirroring firefly "luminous map" transforms hermit-philosopher trope via moon-path whistle ingenuity. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of witness without gimmick. Organic, non-obvious angle on entropy defiance feels inevitable.</comment>
