<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Preemptive nostalgia embodied in "sharp pang...dreading the day she would only remember the work of remembering," constraining passive mourning into active transcription; contradictory impulses (mourn unpassed moments yet preserve fully) act in scene, earning closure shift with identity cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as whispers densify to vision; vanished shadow anomaly at granolith tightens stakes, transcription triggers return with conceptual cost of malformed identity risked, landing CR closure on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains calibration via rain-jeweled panels and whispers, palm contact triggering vision; solid fog as shadow canvas and window charges final hush-filled image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rupture at central monument deepens stakes under accumulative lens, forcing agency in kneeling/transcribing that forecloses forgetting with legible identity resculpture cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vision of "community deliberately forgetting a painful history" reweights selective memory premise; final shadow return and "recovered stories" offer non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archivist perceptual signature in "pieced together narratives from these auditory shards" biases noticing; rhythmic deepening mirrors hush motif, stable single POV under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action with "summer-quill...hovered over her parchment"; purposeful whisper repetitions build texture without loops, minor descriptive churn in fog/crystal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadow lengths calibrating temporal registers ingeniously synthesize memory stewardship; committed world logic transforms archiving tropes into fresh identity-sculpting premise.</comment>
