<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's steadily adaptive caution roots motivation in survival, compelling micro-choices like frost study to retracing and kiln-building; embodied in "brittle" world navigation. Final creation earns change via prior compulsion from ledger, foreclosing passive observation with visible integration cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns accumulate to ledger discovery, cave, silica realization tightening density toward Charged Poise closure in glass slab pulling "at dawn." Cost legible in "fragile, durable truth" reconfiguring her fractured journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon frost, sandstone crevice, cave silica constrain choices (gathering/purifying) and charge final slab image with "star-points" and "charcoal trails." Sensory selection (rime, smoke smell) reflects POV urgency, integrated via goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose in pauses) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ledger compulsion narrowing to creation; agency in regimen/retracing forecloses endurance with cost in "shadow" held light. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden creation/purpose emerges organically from frost fragility to slab's "transparent, yet full of history," reweighting survival as material without moralizing. Final image non-literally answers pauses via "lineage of hidden makers."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical 3rd-close POV stable, perceptual signature in light/frost patterns selective to artist's bias; rhythmic modulation builds from "drifting resonance" to "clear note." No dialogue; diction purposeful without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm suits accumulative texture; "scorched testament" motif purposeful, not loop. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("maps of the night's breath") purposeful for voice, no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artist tracing smuggler-glassmakers embeds ledger in art, transforming survival trope via "charcoal trails like old paths"; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance inevitably.</comment>
