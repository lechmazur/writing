<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to navigate loss drives concrete micro-choices like adjusting the antenna via the censer's warmth, earning her endurance at closure; embodied grief via the object's pulse is particular and contradictory. Minor slips in alternating summary ("Her motivation was clear") dilute simultaneity of impulses during building beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase through moon-cycled building to CR closure: censer cools as "task complete," reweighting loss with conceptual cost of traversed scars. Orientation anchors early (deck, dusk failure); one tightening via full moon suffices, no causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station's scrap heap and deck constrain assembly choices tactilely; censer as micro-setting charges final image by guiding adjustments and stilling at dawn. Sensory selectivity (starlit glow, coiled cord) mirrors grief without catalog; spatial coherence clean across time elision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal to traverse loss) tightens accumulatively via calls and moon phases narrowing tactics; agency in building forecloses adrift inertia with felt cost of pieced endurance. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal need; price legible in "days bled into nights."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reverse migration emerges via particulars (star paths, censer pulse) to resonant CR: "found her way home not in place, but in peace" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in fluctuating solace avoids binaries; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias (songs, tides in navigation); rhythmic modulation heightens moon-cycle pressure. Call descriptions carry subtext via riddles without direct dialogue issues; diction controlled, no head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density propels via image integration ("cord coiled like a serpent"); rhythm varies with scene breath. Minor artifacts: "raw solace" paraphrase loop twice and minor synonym churn ("patchwork" thrice) dull mid-beats, not closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-signal station and moon-fluctuating censer transforms migration trope via textured loss-navigation; risk in lyric accumulative holds stakes to charged poise without gimmick. Closing image ("needle stitching the sky") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
