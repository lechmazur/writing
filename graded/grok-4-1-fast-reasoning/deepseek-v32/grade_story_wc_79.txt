<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in quiet drive intensifies through pattern work to compel teaching sequences, earning redirection with renunciation cost; interiority concrete in "quiet engine, burning without flame." Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density to Conceptual Repricing closure: journal reveals watchers as mirror, city turns with cost in "dread did not lift, but it changed... solemn respect." Orientation anchored immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shell spirals constrain mapping choices and charge final image of "eyes on the spirals, forever cartographing"; sunwashed specificity filters through Kael's priorities, vivid across senses without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to question watchers signaled early, tightens via fracture/journal/whistle under textural lens, narrowing to agency-driven turn-away with legible cost in foreclosed path; single deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-patterned navigation vs. external mirrors emerges organically, resonant final image reweights dread without moralizing: "solemn respect for the vast, patterned silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in spiral/noticing bias; rhythmic texture modulates purposefully, compression taught early via mappings, legible at whistle closure.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; "thin, almost lost in the vast air" exemplifies propulsion in peak whistle beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of migratory turtle-city and shell-pattern language feels inevitable, risk in tonal dread-heightened poise transforms tropes; gate/whistle turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
