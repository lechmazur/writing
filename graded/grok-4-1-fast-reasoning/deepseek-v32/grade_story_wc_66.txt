<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to teach dust stories roots actions like embedding codes in scores, intensifying to dust animation; interiority concrete via pencil stilling and glow fixation. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal decoding beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as encoded lyrics and glow density reweight silence; CR closure lands on-page with dust forming shapes ("tiny sailing ship"), etching conceptual cost of defiance in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist alcove and dust corner constrain secrecy and enable glow's payoff; sensory hierarchy (greenish glow, static) filters through Aris's priorities, charging closure as stories "glimmer on every surface."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake against story famine signaled early, tightens accumulatively via direct address ("The dust listens") forcing radio aim on dust; agency in transcription narrows to triumphant reconfiguration with felt void-fracture cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art-cloaked defiance emerges organically from lyric codes to dust tales; final image of "stories now glimmer[ing]" offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (luminous scripts on walls, dust trembling); rhythmic prose modulates serene intensity, perceptual bias toward hidden transmissions coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery (glow "pulsed in time with distant...transmissions"); minor figurative density ("thistled calm" reprise) without muddle, though slight repetition of "secretly luminous" borders scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio piracy, dust animation, and encoded symphony transforms famine trope; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable dust-shapes closure, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
