<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Leo's serene traits and decisively kind approach compel micro-choices like vinyl offering and calls, earning reunion with embodied cost in Mara's softening; relationships crucible reunion forces stasis with pride foreclosed. Elara/Mara reactions particular via halting talk to flow. Minor label-speak ("decisively kind") slightly abstracts but actions anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from blood news to music layers to reunion, tightening via Mara's arrival as pattern break; RR closure in Elara's death/reconfiguration of family with relational cost legible in "flawless" whisper and warmed vinyl. Orientation anchored immediately in balcony/Radiant Haven. One transition (Mara arrives) legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cloud sea, alpine air slipping window constrain serenity/peace; vinyl micro-setting charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy (scent over visual) POV-specific to Leo's hope motif. Details evolve: pulsing stillness deepens to space between breaths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye/reunify) signaled early, accumulative escalation via music beats deepening to reunion cadence shift narrowing estrangement options; agency in Leo's nudges/calls, cost felt in tears/pride yield charging final hands-held image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope-as-whisper/scent emerges via vinyl/mundane hymns reweighting brokenness to beauty; final hay-sun fragrance resonant non-literal answer to goodbye question, ambiguity in fleeting eternity lingers without moral. Vinyl shifts from symbol to tactile bridge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Leo perceptual signature (scent/texture bias) modulates rhythmically; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I'm ready," "She should be here") advances reunion. No head-hopping, distance tightens at death.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., vinyl smoothed edges evoke history/action); rhythm varies, no loops though "pulsing stillness" recurs purposefully. Minor overwriting in scents/metaphors taught early, propels without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice music therapy + vinyl shard as hope conduit transforms deathbed trope; scent-of-hope inflected uniquely, risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
