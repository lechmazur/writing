<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo's arc from frustration ("I don't understand") to diffusion shows contradictory impulses acting in the trance observation, earning the final integration with visible cost of abandoning conscious effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ripple patterns deepen resonance, landing RR closure in Leo's transparent reflection with integration cost; orientation anchored early in platform/grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's "deep, attracting silence" and pond constrain alignment choice, charging the final vanishing image with starlight fissures mirroring integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of conjuring cloaking tightens accumulatively through stone drops and observation, forcing diffusion agency with foreclosed effort path legible in "stopped trying to cloak himself."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rings shift "rock/shout" to "quiet wood/still water," offering resonant non-literal answer to vanishing-as-appearing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of resonance ("propagation of consequence") biases noticing consistently through Leo's trance without head-hopping; diction modulates absorption rhythmically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Ripple rings expanded in flawless silence" propels with density and varied rhythm; no loops, elevated diction fits voice without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ripple-as-resonance synthesizes reverse-aging mentorship into inevitable fresh turn, risking abstract mysticism grounded in pond geometry.</comment>
