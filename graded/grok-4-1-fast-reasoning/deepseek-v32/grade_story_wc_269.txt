<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as coral witness driving discovery, with tapping as particularized method revealing focus under analytical pressure. Interiority concrete in embodied rhythm but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; reflections tilt toward summary over micro-choices. Earned endurance in acceptance feels credible but not charged by scene-deep conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of data points builds from atlas discovery to cascade revelation as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting sea rise premise with conceptual cost of delayed cascades legible in "profound silence." Single scene fits defaults; one tightening via whisper-to-complete revelation narrows knowledge without opposition gaps. Cost felt in responsibility anchoring final report draft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station and ocean vividly selective—grating, sighs, sensor beeps, console laminate—mirroring Kai's tapping and constraining analysis via data/tools. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to tide pulse and sonar ghosts; micro-setting (atlas on desk) guides correlation beat. Evolving details (frayed edges to folded relic) charge closure without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover vanishing paths) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening correlations to ecosystem cascade, forcing knowledge shift and stance crystallization in silence. Agency in data assembly forecloses simplistic rise narrative with felt responsibility cost. One tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes, viscerally tied to reefs/atolls.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fragile cascade consequences emerges organically from particulars (bleaching to smothered seagrass), resonant in atlas reprise without statement. Final report draft as non-literal answer reweights prior web, inviting ambiguity on ban's lateness. No moralizing; irony in periodically eternal cycles charges CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic noticing (tide pulse mirroring taps); voice texture modulates from staccato to slowing silence effectively. Prose rhythm echoes tapping without monotony; no head-hopping or elision issues. Compression purposeful for lyric accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (tapping cadence to hum), high density in integrated data images, but minor paraphrase loops on revelation ("delayed revelation," "whisper," "complete") and repetitive phrasing ("drifting moored") dull select beats (−0.6). No scaffold in closure; strong verbs propel. Varied syntax supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological cascade beyond sea rise, transformed via Kai's witness/tapping into "paths erased by life's landmarks." Risky lyric tone heightens stakes organically; no templates, memorable in moored drift amid change. Closing report as inevitable reconfiguring feels bold.</comment>
