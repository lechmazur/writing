<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict peaks concretely when she dismantles the rigid trellis out of "exhausted defiance," earning her metamorphosis through contradictory impulses between control and release. Flaws like reluctance to interact drive mistakes, such as the lifeless rebuild. Final customer interaction reveals changed hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from damage observation to leaf pivot ("a single, perfect linden leaf... like a deliberate note"), culminating in Charged Poise RR at "the page where her old self ended." Orientation anchors immediately in nursery storm damage. Cost legible in "personal failure" admission shaping organic rebuild.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden details constrain choices: scentless cedar fails, prompting use of "pliable willow whips... supple runners of the ivy." Sensory hierarchy plant-focused (petrichor, dripping light). Final "mossy trellis after rain" as "living tapestry" charges image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct wisteria meaningfully) tightens via leaf-inspired reversal, narrowing from rigid control to organic facilitation under Accumulative lens. Looming "next storm forecast" forces defiance decision with felt cost (dismantling labor). Agency in weaving scaffold forecloses failure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of release emerges organically from failed rebuild to "patient reknitting," reweighting control premise without statement. Linden leaf reprises shift meaning across beats. Customer scene offers non-literal answer: "Sometimes you reconstruct by first letting go," charged by prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: plant-logic metaphors ("language of xylem and phloem," "silent, green logic") bias noticing. Rhythmic control modulates from grim precision ("sharp, angry sounds") to sustaining flow. Minimal dialogue natural, subtextual in customer exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm: short, embodied sentences under stress ("Her hands clenching and unclenching"). Minor metaphor density in reflections ("scrawled a different text") risks overwrite but coheres without muddle. No loops; propulsion peaks at "made a decision born of exhausted defiance."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nursery as metaphor for personal surrender transforms growth trope via specific organic rebuild. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable linden leaf reprise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
