<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between harnessing urge and promise restraint acts in scene via micro-choices like sprinkling dust then releasing; final renunciation earned with perceptual cost. Curse trait particularizes via fragmented visions constraining insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rock placement to dust ignition and visions toward CR closure where Kael releases control, reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost in "harnessed nothing but his own perception." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via shifting vision suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora and bluff integrate purposefully, mirroring internal patterns and constraining rock sequences; tidal eels recur tactilely, charging final harmony image without overt symbolism. Sensory selection POV-biased toward celestial/math priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher patterns via dust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through vision of misunderstanding, forcing renunciation agency; cost legible in foreclosed control path and evolved promise. Escalation coheres under lens without need for reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of connection over control emerges organically from rock/dust/visions arc, resonant in final image of natural harmony without moralizing; borrowed dawn shifts meaning non-literally. Minor abstraction in "sacred patterns" realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in visionary/math diction; rhythmic modulation builds to release beat, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but minor paraphrase loops on "promise lingered" and vision fragments dull peak slightly (−0.4); no closure touch, rhythmic control strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of precog curse, frictionless world, eel herding, and star dust transforms tropes into inevitable pattern-realization arc; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
