<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in promise to Alistair drives consistent traits like empirical intuition, culminating in earned doorway choice with foreclosed loneliness path. Interiority concrete via object-handling and decision hesitation. Minor epiphany tidiness at "every decision is a map drawn in real time" avoids full contradiction under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chip discovery therefore ant-following therefore cavern therefore insertion DC with CR understanding as closure, cost legible in internalized maps reconfiguring loneliness. Orientation anchored early in shop/creek. One tightening at keyhole revelation narrows to courage vs stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss and crystalline walls constrain path and charge final glow-understanding image; creek rise mirrors internal pressure, evolving causally. Sensory selection (jasmine, ferns, roar) POV-filtered via map-dealer intuition. Micro-setting (chip, archway) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise) signaled early, tightens causally to doorway decision narrowing loneliness vs connection, agency in insertion with felt clarity cost. One reversal at crevice entry raises isolation risk. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of decisions as real-time maps emerges organically from chip-projection to internalized paths, resonating in final "new map within" without moralizing. Subtext in avoided connections reweights premise via CR. Complexity lingers in promise's shift from discovery to courage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in topographic/map biases; diction selective (yellowed parchments, topographic pattern). Rhythm modulates from quiet shop to pounding heart at archway. No dialogue; compression purposeful in ant-trail ellipsis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (chip "vibrating softly as the creek's murmur grew louder"); varied rhythm, no loops though "glimmer" recurs purposefully. Clean syntax propels to closure image without overwriting in peak chamber beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: matrix chip as topographic key, ants as "guides that build their own roads" transforms quest trope via empirical whimsy, inevitable hindsight at projection moment. Risks bold in internal-glimmer closure over physical portal.</comment>
