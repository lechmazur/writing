<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's grief embodied in "locked locket with nothing inside but ash" shows contradictory impulses of solemnity and emerging curiosity; final etching and delivery earned by visions, foreclosing isolated mourning with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through parcel density to perceptual shards; closure as Conceptual Repricing in ring's projection reconfigures grief with undeniable conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vellum "translucent as a dragonfly's wing" and stencil-as-tool constrain choices (meditation parts curtain) and charge final wrist projection; perceptual observatory evolves purposefully under POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of grief renewal signaled early tightens via visions' deepening, narrowing isolation; protagonist agency in parting curtain and delivering ring pays visible cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vine duality shifts from decay to seed in visions and ring, offering resonant non-literal answer to grief-as-endpoint; emerges organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature ("coaxed light from onyx"); rhythmic control heightens subdued ardor to charged poise in final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("petals falling...new shoot emerged"); zero loops, figurative coherence in vine/stencil, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Origami astronomy to perceptual nexus and projecting ring synthesize fresh perceptual journey; risk-taking in mosaic shards heightens stakes organically.</comment>
