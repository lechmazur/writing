<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between technical perfection and raw creativity act in scene via trembling fingers over journal sketches, earning the final free-flowing cave drawing with embodied cost of grief for lost time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as journal reveal deepens density toward RR closure in the finished sketch reconfiguring artistic stance, with cost legible in "auroral sorrow deepened" before lifting; orientation anchored immediately in cave solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystals' pulsing light and natural ledge constrain choices by providing glow for sketching and space for relics, charging the final image of cave on paper; sensory details filtered through artistic POV bias.</comment>
