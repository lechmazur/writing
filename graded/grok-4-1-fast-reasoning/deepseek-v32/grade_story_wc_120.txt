<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between chronological homesickness and fierce drive acts in scene through mapping despite "fatigue tugged at her bones," earning the final endurance and conduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of mapped memories to Conceptual Repricing closure in "visible waves of color and emotion" across horizon, with felt cost in sustained exhaustion; orientation anchored immediately in spire by lake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nautilus shell and mirrored horizon constrain conduction choice and charge final image, with sensory details like "chambers glowing under starlight" integrated into action; body as micro-setting tugs with creeping cold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conduction before exhaustion deepens via dawn tightening under accumulative lens, forcing trade-off in spirit-siphoning work; cost legible in "pushed on, her hand steady" but sustained at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of form-giving to formless past emerges organically through mapped memories manifesting as symphony, offering resonant non-literal answer in "unheard symphony now heard" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic fragment-noticing (e.g., "geometry of a dandelion clock"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure to dawn without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors (nautilus as "miniature galaxy"); minor figurative density in memory-tracing fits taught lyric pattern without obscuring climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writing, nautilus-mapping, and visual symphony on mirrored ice transforms homesickness trope into bold, inevitable conceptual conduction with risk-taking payoff.</comment>
