<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's reactively visionary trait creates embodied struggle in fitful flashes, compelling her shift from restoring sound to mapping pattern; final renunciation of full restoration feels earned via prior visions accumulating cost in the crushed bell moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vial releases build pattern density toward RR closure (phantom echoes as diagram); cost legible in "heart sank; the key was broken," reconfiguring options without causal break; orientation anchored by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's rain-slicked quays and derelict tower constrain path via "directional pull" and shale burial, charging final image; sensory selection (salt-corroded case, warm valve) mirrors visionary urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile fragments) tightens accumulatively via visions revealing rhythm, narrowing to broken bell trade-off; agency in feverish mapping forecloses restoration path with legible cost under lens, though climax gathering feels slightly declarative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Navigated absences emerge organically as voids mapped into lattice, resonant CR in dusk gathering reweighting loss without moralizing; final "diagram waiting to be filled" answers premise non-literally from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (oceanic motifs like "dissolved into mist") biases toward shards/echoes; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without leakage, though elevated diction borders opacity in peak visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration (e.g., "ghostly resonance would guide"); no loops or scaffolds, but minor figurative density in harbor lattice risks slight overwriting without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Memory-impregnated spray and reactive visions synthesize fresh alchemy of absence into score; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in indispensable trumpet-as-framework turn, transforming exile trope organically.</comment>
