<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid embodiment of meticulous devotion through precise actions like "hand moving with gently meticulous precision," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ depth; endurance feels earned yet unpressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds sampling density to discovery of vow-frequency ("a strand of pure intention"), delivering CR closure that reconfigures illusions' meaning with legible cost of fading in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors like "quartz hush" and "cold that seeped from the frozen walls" constrain measurements; lantern slide as micro-setting charges discovery beat and final preparation image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation signaled early tightens via anomaly ("strong, clear, a strand of pure intention"), forcing deepened tactics with cost of fraying echoes felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of conjured meaning emerges implicitly through vow-discovery, with final "patterns of commitment that defied oblivion" resonantly reweighting illusions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, hushed perceptual signature ("crystalline air," "whine filled the air") stable in single POV, with rhythmic control heightening accumulative hush to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but minor paraphrase loops in repeated "sampling frequencies" phrases dull mid-process propulsion without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of illusion-archiving via vow-frequencies transforms dream-library trope; discovery turn feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
