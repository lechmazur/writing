<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to fetch wisdom from failure is concrete and intensifies via embodied heartbeat counter against deliberate tracing work. Interiority particular through peripheral heartbeat flicker (72,71,73) revealing pressure. Subtle contradictory impulses (frantic heart vs. slow work) act in scene but lack deeper simultaneous layering, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink fractals build density toward ghost stabilization and confession. On-page CR closure via dried ink as "permanent, intricate map of the truth" reweights failure premise with solitude/time cost legible in final placement of shard. Orientation anchored early; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (creaking timbers, high-altitude silence, snow deepening) reflects Leo's priorities, constraining focus amid chaos. Opal dome and projector cast milky light charges final image; recurring porcelain shard as micro-setting constrains key choices. Environment subtly mirrors internal persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (extract wisdom via defragmentation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through fractal tracing narrowing to Thorne's confession, with heartbeats/time as felt cost. Agency in micro-choices (tracing spirals) drives tightening; minor abstractness in stakes prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from misinterpretation emerges organically via "fault was in the assumption of linear decay," resonant non-literal answer reweighting linear expectations. Final ink map and heartbeat steadiness recharge particulars without moralizing; complexity lingers in borrowed time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (silence amplifying hum/thump) biased to Leo's exile. Prose texture modulates rhythmically with pressure; ghost's whisper natural, subtext-laden ("I was wrong"). No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "ink and blood reacted, blooming into complex, swirling fractals"). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwrought figuration ("symphony of beautiful, broken data") in opener slightly dulls early propulsion, but no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of digital ghost defragmentation via ink fractals transforms tropes organically. Fresh premise (death certificate exile fetching failure-wisdom) feels inevitable; porcelain-blood ritual risks bold alchemy without gimmick, heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
