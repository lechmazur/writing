<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in family legacy scrutiny, with contradictory impulses (bury vs. expose) acting in the drawer discovery and final reasoning; earned change via document peaks at "truth was the only viable path." Minor diagnostic label-speak ("devotedly observant") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journalist call → anomalies → locked drawer → manuscript → press release DC with business-shake cost legible in "shake the family business" and sealing envelope. Orientation anchors early; one tightening at hairpin unlock suffices. Closure Charged Poise reconfigures legacy orbit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory dome and clouds constrain reflective isolation, charging final image; rosewood nib handled tactilely recurs to enable writing choice. Sensory hierarchy (starlight piercing haze, clouds swirling like ink) filters through observant POV without catalog. Study drawer integrates via goal-action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. exposure) signaled early tightens at manuscript contradiction, narrowing to intervene-or-bury via agency (hairpin, drafting); cost felt in "corroded its soul" and final lightness vs. shake. Causal lens escalation coherent, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orbits motif emerges via timeline tracing and cycle-break, reweighting premise in final pen glide and "choices, not fixed paths" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (nib scripting confession) invites ambiguity on redemption cost. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (observant scrutiny of sheets, maneuvers, anomalies); voice modulates rhythmically in reflective beats to peak decisiveness. No dialogue; diction controlled, inference modest (e.g., "seemed to pulse").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("proof by contradiction" twice, "orbits of regret," "solemn playfulness") and repetitive stems dull density slightly; rhythm varies but elevated diction borders register drift in closure ("texture of redemption"). Propulsion strong, no major artifacts at seal-envelope peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logic method (proof by contradiction) with newsprint legacy/orbits trope, transformed via nib-as-channel and observatory irony; risk in personal confession feels organic, inevitable in hindsight at dawn-tinted clouds.</comment>
