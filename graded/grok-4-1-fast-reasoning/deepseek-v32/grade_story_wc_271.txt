<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotions via chest tightness and cold fingers ground interiority effectively; quiet talent mirrors plant care to internal growth without labels dominating. Minor diagnostic slips like "somatic markers, her therapist had explained" feel unearned mid-reflection but do not touch closure planting beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from pruning freeze to storm pearl to final planting; closure as Charged Poise in steady hands digging soil reconfigures options with scar-cost residue. Orientation anchors early (arboretum, cliff, photo); one tightening via storm suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (waves' crash, damp earth scent) filters through Aria's priorities; cliff arboretum and bench constrain grounding choices, charging final soil-digging image. Lighthouse beam recurs purposefully without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor optimism amid pain) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via storm panic to no-freeze planting; visible cost in "weariness" residue and "scars" forecloses old freeze path. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating stillness emerges organically from somatic beats and plant parallels; final "pearl...to cultivate" image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing. Photo creases embrace scar complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with somatic perceptual signature (body freezes, breath noticed); rhythmic prose modulates from surge to stillness without filter excess. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm supports propulsion. Minor loops in "somatic markers" and "pearl of stillness" recur but pattern-taught; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of somatic therapy in cliffside arboretum post-trauma; lighthouse keeper parallel adds non-obvious solitude angle. Trauma-gardening trope transformed via embodied markers.</comment>
