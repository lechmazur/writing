<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elm's interior contradiction between isolating grief and family weave emerges concretely through still hands and poem readings; final sketch earns change via prior failure's cost. Spectral Silas forces micro-choices revealing values. No unearned epiphanies; embodied despair anchors motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stillness accumulates via ribbon poems to RR closure in sketching weave, reconfiguring grief with prior crack's cost legible in "now a profound stillness held him." Orientation anchored early; no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse panes and dusk light constrain revelation as "last light faded"; butterflies' "relentless, calm movement" charge final image, mirroring weave. Sensory hierarchy (echoing chisel, rustle of wings) reflects meditative POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief's shape) signaled early tightens accumulatively via Silas's instruction and poem contours narrowing to tapestry realization. Agency in reading and drafting forecloses solitary monument with felt cost of cracked child stone. Escalation reweights under lens without slips.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory as interconnected weave emerges organically from ribbon/poems/butterflies; final "carve the weave, not the wound" reconfigures premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; irony in "crack was not in the stone" layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (spectral shapes, wing rustles); rhythmic diction modulates from "thundering calm" to charged poise. Silas's "dry as pressed leaves" voice distinct; no head-hopping, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels: metaphors cohere (thunder/wings/butterfly procession) without muddle in peak realization. Rhythmic variety (short chisel echoes to flowing sentences) varies naturally; zero loops, precise syntax supports meditative propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving, poem artifact, spectral grandpa, and butterfly migration transforms grief trope organically. Ribbon as "map" turn inevitable from particulars; bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
