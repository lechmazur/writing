<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Leo's "quietly analytic" trait consistently drives precise actions like documenting artifacts, earning the closure realization; internal conflict emerges subtly in embodied melancholy during the snow globe discovery. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery beats, leaning toward summary. Motivation intensifies credibly through accumulative findings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with discovery density building to CR closure: journal note reconfigures letting go as transmission beyond self, cost felt in "heavy with understanding but light with release." Orientation anchored early in submersible entry. One tightening via linking ship's transmission to Earhart suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow globe and floating books as micro-settings constrain handling choices and charge final protective casing; sensory details like "leather-bound volumes drifted like sleepy fish" filter through analytic POV, mirroring internal release amid decay. Vivid, purposeful integration evolves with action. Recurring objects reweight closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding letting go) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via artifact deepenings narrowing analytic options toward acceptance; agency in untangling forces trade-off of melancholy for clarity. Cost legible in surfacing with "buoyant truth." One cadence shift sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of release as physics emerges organically from particulars like equation-note and transmissions, resonating in final journal without overt moralizing; snow globe reprise reweights loss. Earned epiphany avoids platitudes via concrete artifacts. Subtle ambiguity in defying equations lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with analytic perceptual signature in precise observations; voice texture modulates from immersion to clarity. Repetition of key phrases risks uniformity but serves accumulative rhythm. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "untangling threads," "quietly analytic," and "physics of letting go" across realizations dull density (-1.2); template cadence in repetitive epiphany stems like "He understood now..." triggers -0.6. Closure image clear but momentum drags in reflective beats. Some vivid propulsion in setting lines.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart echo in sunken library artifacts transforms deep-sea tropes into letting-go physics; ship's log equation and snow globe gift inflect originality. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
