<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (engineering pragmatism vs. artistic yearning entangled in geologist's loneliness) earn the closure transformation; helix-mind traits shown through spiraling thoughts and micro-choices like mirror adjustments. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("helix-minded engineer") slightly abstracts early motivation without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-building memory waves culminating in Charged Poise RR closure ("She modified her intention in real time... conservator"); cost legible in "weight... clarifying" her path. Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and cracked mirror constrain choices (filaments connected, angle adjusted) and charge final image ("canyon bones white," ghosts "acknowledged"); sensory hierarchy (dust/oil hands, teeth hum) reflects engineer's priorities. Body/tool as micro-setting evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth dreams via modification) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening waves narrowing to personal entanglement and stance crystallization; agency in real-time intention shift forecloses prior path with clarifying cost. Pivotal adjustment beat ("hands... tremor") tests commitment without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving failed aspirations emerges organically from entangled fragments to resonant reconfiguration ("curated collection of soul-stuff"); final image reweights builder-to-conservator arc without moralizing. Particulars like father's sketches avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with helix-signature perceptual bias (spiraling thoughts, "quaking reverie"); rhythmic prose modulates from frenzy to calm precision, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative texture ("scar of silver and indigo," "crystalline emotions") integrated into action; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting density in memory waves slightly risks coherence but patterns cohere without loops or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh neural archaeology premise via cracked mirror diffraction transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in synaptic conceit and conservator synthesis feels inevitable, heightening stakes through quantum echoes. Bold voice integrates without gimmickry.</comment>
