<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to illuminate mundane drives consistent traits and micro-choices like pond throw and pane installation; interiority concrete via hands "reading between lines of lead and fracture." Earned change in installing etched pane as relic, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ripple patterns and light spectra accumulate to CR closure: "light struck the etched glass... a map of noctilucent reckonings made visible," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of transience vs. permanence in final image. Orientation anchored early in Pearl Bay/Prism Atrium; single-shard fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pond ripples and etched glass constrain revelation beat and charge final image ("cast a web of luminous lines"); mist-veiled Atrium evolves causally with sun climb, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy glazier-specific: light refraction over all.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode etching tightens accumulatively via pond micro-turn changing knowledge of "depth" over distance; agency in stone throw forecloses misreading with felt conceptual cost at pane installation. Minor abstractness in stakes vs. visceral embodiment prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden value emerges organically from glass etch, ripples, spectra to resonant CR: "value sat not in the object, but in the light it was asked to hold, and the shadows it chose to cast." Final fisherman exchange recharges without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with glazier perceptual signature in light/refraction diction; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual, but single line limits distinction test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm ("ripples bouncing back... complex, fleeting tapestry"); no loops or scaffolds obscure cause/effect. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("diffuse pearl," "noctilucent reckonings") near discovery slightly dulls propulsion without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms glazier trade into lens for "noctilucent" truths via ripple proxy; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes. Pond-stone method offers non-obvious inflection on reflection trope.</comment>
