<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with retrocognition as contradictory curse/gift driving micro-choices like touching the prism; final realization earned by prior visions, foreclosing futile years with embodied cost in "thistle-blown hope" persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions accumulate to path reveal, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) where beam pulses from fracture with legible cost of unhealed break and grandfather's words fulfilled on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pavilion's hum vibrates bones during alignment, constraining realignment choice; recurring prism and stars filter through POV urgency, charging final beam image without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove meaning) signaled early, deepens via silence-to-path shift narrowing futile ritual to precise turn; agency in realignment forecloses doubt with visible cost of fracture conducting, not healing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of assembled meaning emerges organically from prism visions and grandfather's constellation; final beam reweights fragments-to-light without moral, resonant via silence's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/echo biases; rhythmic modulation peaks in "hum deepened, becoming a chorus," distinct texture without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "fitted the broken prism... hum... vibrated in his bones" advances action/atmosphere; varied rhythm, no loops, purposeful metaphors like "thistle-blown hope" recharge closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition unlocking star-path in fracture transforms post-collapse tropes; risk in cryptic ritual pays off inevitably in beam's quiet defiance.</comment>
