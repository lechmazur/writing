<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in collecting fragments to "patch the holes" yet deepening confusion, embodied in "heavy stone" regret; final renunciation by dropping wheel earned via ghost's pressure. Ghost as second character forces crucible choices. Minor early reflection summaries tilt present effectively without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density weaves to ghost emergence as tightening, RR closure via wheel drop ("sank without a ripple") reconfigures self-made stasis with legible cost of foreclosed path. Orientation anchored instantly in lagoon/POV. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lagoon constrains negotiation (ghost walks its surface) and charges final image (stirs as he leaves), sensory selective (slosh, mists mirror internal fracture). Micro-setting (wheel sinking) mirrors release. Specificity purposeful, no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve regret via ghost) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragment density hardening resolve into confrontation; agency in clicking/drop forecloses scavenging with on-page cost. Ghost crystallizes stance under lens. Subtle tightening fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed pasts failing own timeline emerges organically via weaving echoes; final descent offers resonant reweighting without moral, embracing ambiguity of lingering regret as "lesson etched." No direct statement, irony in ghost's blended voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (overheard shards as "brittle shard of sound"); voice texture poetic yet biased (ambition "dust"). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("Your ambition eroded because it was built on sand"), distinct from narration. Rhythm modulates to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "currents weaving... murmuring tapestry"); varied rhythm propels, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative purposeful under lyric accumulative mode, though dense in opener risks slight muddle pre-pattern teach. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal premise (story-capturing wheel, water-walking ghost) transforms regret trope via kinetic rules; fresh synthesis inevitable in wheel's lightening/drop. Bold risk in nonlinear memory shards heightens without gimmick.</comment>
