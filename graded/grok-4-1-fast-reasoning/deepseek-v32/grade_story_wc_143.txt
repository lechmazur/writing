<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetition of "purposefully curious" as label undermines interior contradiction and micro-choices; motivation clear but lacks embodied conflict in pivotal waiting beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to bloom; on-page CR closure via final descent image reweights preservation with extinction cost, legible in "era ended" pang.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Suit, regolith, oxygen constrain endurance; sand grain and vial as micro-settings charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture last bloom) tightens accumulatively via light shifts to flower emergence; agency in endurance/outlasting forecloses failure path with era-loss cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Preservation vs. inevitable loss emerges organically from bloom, message, sand; final photo as "testament to outlasting oblivion" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with selective lunar perception; voice texture poetic but drifts to repetitive phrasing, eroding perceptual signature under anticipation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("dawning hush," "purposefully curious," "moonlit summit") and synonym churn (melancholy/sorrow/loss) across beats dull propulsion; template cadence in descriptive runs obscures density at bloom climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi preservation via photochemical vial and dawn flower transforms lunar exploration trope; chemical message turn feels earned from early setup.</comment>
