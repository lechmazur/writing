<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied nostalgia (shell cool against palm) driving micro-choices like intuitive adjustments; motivation intensifies via fading memory ache, earning change in compassionate revaluation. Minor diagnostic slips like "scientifically romantic" label without full embodied tradeoff slightly blunt peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from shell placement to vision's deepening layers, landing CR closure in final shell-pocketing image with conceptual cost of dynamic memory (no relic, but lens). Orientation anchored early (Ember Nexus, tonight); one tightening via unnoticed past details suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember basins and twilight glow constrain choices (channel glow into shell) and charge final edge-walk image; nautilus shell as micro-setting evolves tactilely (cool to warm), mirroring internal shift. Sensory selection alchemist-biased, selective, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture density) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in vision's new perceptions (tremor, hesitation), forcing reweighting with felt overwhelm/cost. Agency in spectral witnessing forecloses static nostalgia; cost legible in layered palette hues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dynamic presence emerges organically from particulars (vision's missed details, shell's signature), resonant CR in "continual, different return" without moralizing. Final image reweights premise via deepened bond, inviting ambiguity on memory's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with alchemist's perceptual signature (frequency, light particles, emotional charge); rhythmic prose modulates from precise procedure to overwhelming spectrum. Purposeful poetic compression legible, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, metaphors coherent (logarithmic spiral as temporal key, palette hues); no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in descriptive flourishes purposeful for texture, not obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy-memory distillation transforms nostalgia trope via specific world logic (sound from shell, ember-glow channeling); risk in "ghost witness" revaluation heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from nautilus harmonic payoff.</comment>
