<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in singular trait, intensifying to compel restoration; actions align systematically. Lacks concrete interior contradiction or embodied micro-choices under pressure, e.g., no dramatized hesitation during pilgrimage summary. Feels competent but archetypal without visible flaws complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: vibration clue therefore pilgrimage to song score therefore echo restoration (DC/RR closure). On-page closure blooms with "Elara" name and light wave, cost legible in "reminder of all that was still silent." Orientation anchored early in first paragraph; single arc fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (pulsing lights, absorbed sounds, shimmering stacks) reflects priorities and mirrors stakes. Opal library constrains via index tree and relic access; recurring bamboo charges final image. No white-room; purposeful bias in extinct feelings galleries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Sonder/sound) signaled early, tightens via vibration discovery narrowing to song echo. Agency in pilgrimage and channeling forces trade-off; cost felt in near-loss grief and ongoing silence. Escalation causal under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interconnection/preservation emerges organically via sonder restoration without statement. Final image ("echo faded, but the name remained") reweights premise with poignant ambiguity. Resonance from particulars like "foxglove regret" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (measured heartbeat touch, fossilized vibration). Prose texture distinct in syntax/rhythm modulation; no dialogue or head-hopping. Purposeful compression legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sentences propel via image integration (e.g., "crack began to glow... with sound"). Minor figurative density in descriptive beats purposeful for textural lens but borders overwriting; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise (museum of extinct feelings, sound-preserved names) synthesized freshly; bamboo resonator and sonder entry transform tropes. Risky lyric style heightens stakes coherently; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
