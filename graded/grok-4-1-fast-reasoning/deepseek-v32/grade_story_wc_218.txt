<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in lifelong work intensified by diagnosis compels actions, with micro-choices like wiring patterns revealing values. Interiority concrete via systematic observation, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Final endurance earned by prior buildup, with weakening body as embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from diagnosis to wiring network to deepening hum and communion. Orientation anchored early (Elara, Isle, orchard). Closure as Charged Poise in "Her body failed... diary lay beside her," reconfiguring options with her death as legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ozone/pear scent, pillar hum in feet) filtered through botanical POV. Living pillars/oak constrain choices (roots as conduit, wire integration). Charges final image: "copper wires... encased in new bark... pillars glowed softly."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore interspecies dialogue) signaled early, tightens via textural density (hum to chord to voice). Agency in precise wiring forecloses hesitancy with exhaustion cost. Escalation under lens culminates in communion reversal, cost felt in body failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of restored symbiosis emerges organically from wiring/communion events. Final image ("island remembered her") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like island memories avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: systematic, patient noticing (pillar veins, diary margins). Prose texture modulates rhythm from calm method to charged pulse. No dialogue; diction controlled, biased toward botanical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from setup to peak without loops or scaffolds. Rhythmic control in climax ("vibration... clear, warm pulse... voice... rose"). Zero artifacts; concrete images replace generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: botanical diary/copper circuitry awakens stone-tree symbiosis. Risky premise transformed via specific logic (mineralized pillars, resonance language). Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
