<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in Kael's patient weaving, rooted in empathy; micro-choices like tilting shutters reveal values. Lacks concrete interior contradiction acting simultaneously—calm feels declarative rather than embodied tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light patterns build density, darkness's tendril contact breaks pattern, closure as Charged Poise in "guardian and darkness watched the stars together" reconfigures with revelation cost over conquest. Orientation anchored immediately; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt dock's wet planks and canal surface constrain choices as canvas for light; recurring water mirrors internal shift from void to cradling stars. Sensory selectivity (visual glow, lapping water) sharpens urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching darkness) signaled early; tightening via tendril cradling light reweights options under accumulative lens, forcing cooperation. Cost legible in patient silence vs. flinching instinct.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of darkness as honored canvas emerges via light-weaving particulars; final image ("canal was at peace") offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting contrast's value.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward empathy; lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, distinct in "spiralingly calm focus." Elevated diction fits guardian's stillness, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in tension beats); high density integrates action/imagery. Minor loops in "silent" repetitions and "weaving" synonyms dull propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of personified darkness and dental-mirror constellations transforms light/dark trope; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via fragile cooperation.</comment>
