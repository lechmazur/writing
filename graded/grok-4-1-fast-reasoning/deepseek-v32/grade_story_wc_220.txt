<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tracker's "nose for death" and weary heart root motivation to bridge past/present; embodied perception (scent/sound/shift layers) drives intuitive decoding choices; closure acceptance as Earned Stasis forecloses endless search with felt finality cost, though internal contradiction leans summary over simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cylinder plays build density/nuances to flash insight ("leaf represented a place"); CR closure on-page as photo/note reconfigures loss into preserved essence; orientation anchored early (Rusthaven, post-war scrapyard); one tightening via riddle-to-mound suffices with legible cost in collapsed distance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cracked wasteland/scrapyard vividly selective via tracker's bias (skeletal library husks, winds whispering ghosts); cylinder grooves' tactile "secret texts" constrain decoding; leaf/capsule under rusted door charge final image, mirroring preservation; sensory hierarchy sharpens crisis (brittle needle, faint crackling).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distance to closeness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening plays/nuances narrowing to mound venture; agency in tracing grooves forecloses isolation path; cost legible in revelation's permanence ("Elara was gone, but her memory preserved"); single intensification charges closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance/loss emerges via leaf/cylinder/photo particulars shifting from brittle relic to bridging essence; subtext in "tinted revelations" implies nostalgia's cost; final image/note ("Find me in quiet places") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (layered scent/sound/intuition); voice texture modulates rhythm (hush deepens to holding breath); purposeful lyric compression in groove-tracing taught early, legible at CR; no dialogue, diction fits wasteland tracker's weathered idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (grooves "etched with fine grooves, but to touch secret texts"); rhythm varies (short insight flashes amid descriptive breaths); minor elevated diction ("whispered winds, ghosts of engines") consistent/voice-motivated, no loops/artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Phonograph riddle decoding post-apoc loss transforms tropes via tracker's synesthetic intuition; cylinder/leaf synthesis feels organic/inevitable; fresh "tinted revelations" from degradation charges CR without late rules; risk in quiet stasis ending heightens emotional specificity.</comment>
