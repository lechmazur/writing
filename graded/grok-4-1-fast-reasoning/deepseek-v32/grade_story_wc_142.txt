<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's dual allegiance creates embodied contradiction, shown in pocketed chip and committee service amid carnival chaos. Final clutch of chip earns endurance with felt cost of imperfect change. Minor telling in "hopeful desperation" summaries slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as graffiti network density builds to charged poise closure clutching chip amid defiant music, reconfiguring adaptation with conceptual cost of erasure risk. Mosaic shards (mural, meeting, whirlwind, eve) taught early via encoded art, transitions legible. Orientation anchored by ~100 words in raft city details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (frying dough, clatter, salt wind) filters through Kael's cataloging bias, constraining graffiti on bulkheads and barge meeting. Chip as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring internal adaptation amid corporate lights on water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate privatization) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via clandestine reorganization narrowing to united front, with eve poise feeling time-cost. Agency in graffiti scheme forecloses passive erasure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embedding chaos in structure emerges organically from graffiti encoding and chip-passing, final image non-literally answering adaptation via defiant music without moralizing. Stone chip reprise reweights shared origins amid change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (orderly cataloging chaos) and rhythmic modulation under pressure. Elara's plain dialogue carries subtext of scattering fear, distinct from Kael's structured speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; "hopeful desperation" motif purposeful, not loop. Minor paraphrase in dual beats ("orderly intuitive") kept under control, propelling to closure without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Graffiti-encoded resistance in raft carnival transforms privatization trope via specific cultural fortification, culminating in chip-sail image as fresh synthesis of endurance.</comment>
