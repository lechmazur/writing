<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mapkeeper's expertise shines in micro-choices like tracing cracks and pouring ripple-mark knowledge into the stone, earning the exhaustion-felt closure; contradictory impulses subtle but embodied in clinging amid assault. Interiority particular via pattern-reading perceptual bias. No safety-hedging flaws, competence balanced by beings' threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns builds to ceiling-fracture realization and bloom cadence shift as RR closure with bone-ache cost legible in "The weight of it made his bones ache." Orientation anchored early (Kael in wastes post-arrival). Single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cracks and cave walls constrain path and resonator tactic, charging final lichen-settled glow; sensory hierarchy (ground-focus amid sky-chaos) POV-specific. Lived-in navigation: cracks "sang" to entrance, fractures blueprint bloom. Evolving details mirror chaos-to-quiet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet in storm) signaled early, tightens via beings' invasion forcing cave-pattern realization; agency in amplifying stone's quiet forecloses chaos path with poured-intent cost. Lens escalation: density reweights to bloom under pressure. Cost unmistakable in final slide-to-exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of amplifying inherent quiet emerges organically via stone-lens and cave-harmonics, resonant in "a flower of absolute quiet" reweighting chaos without moral; final image non-literal answer to storm-premise. Particulars like ripple-marks drive arc inextricable from hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with mapkeeper perceptual signature (fracture "songs," ripple-stories); rhythmic prose modulates from shriek to sigh, e.g., "not a shout, but a sigh." No head-hopping; diction controlled, poetic without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "cracks sang a specific, converging song" advances plot/sets tone); varied rhythm accelerates to pulse, no loops/artifacts. Zero scaffold; propulsion peaks clean in bloom-unfurl without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ice-pattern reading conjures silence-bloom vs. energy chaos, transforming fantasy tropes via "quiet in the storm" inevitability; risk in poetic hush-petal image heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
