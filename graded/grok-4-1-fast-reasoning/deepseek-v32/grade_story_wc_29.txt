<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in isolation from factions compels covert interference; interior contradiction in "cautious hope tightening into a knot" embodies dread vs. determination; earned renunciation of solo stance at "propose unity" with cost of confronting schisms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via interference → echo → voice response → CR realization "true power plays were internal"; orientation anchored in first paragraph; closure cost legible in "charts now seeming like diagrams of human conflict."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Station console, charts, and subsonic vibrations constrain calibration choices; sensory hierarchy via Elara's professional notice of "floor vibrated slightly"; final image charges charts as conflict diagrams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to outwit tricksters tightens causally through layered signal → "You outwit yourselves," narrowing to internal confrontation; agency in adjustments forecloses naive interference with realization cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-division emerges via reflector mimicry, reweighted in final "charts... diagrams of human conflict" without statement; resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in "cosmic whispers"; voice modulates rhythm at peak "grinding starlight"; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven in exchange with entity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; minor overwrites like repeated "ethereal grit" and "grinding starlight" slightly muddle peak without obscuring closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reflector twist ingeniously transforms SETI signals into internal mirror; synthesis of university intrigue and cosmic response feels organic and fresh in voice contact beat.</comment>
