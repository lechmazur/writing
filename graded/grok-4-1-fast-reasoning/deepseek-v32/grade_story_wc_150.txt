<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to restore fractured lineage intensifies through embodied excavation choices, earning final integration; warmly curious trait replaces fear with reverence at glyphs without therapy-speak. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak rebuilding moment holds back 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wandering to sundial rebuild to CR closure where shadow along groove reweights journeys as cycles with conceptual cost of prior fracture. Orientation anchors early; single purposeful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's bones/root micro-setting constrains hands-on excavation and charges final shadow image, narrowing to sunlight channels; sensory hierarchy (bees hum, thick air) reflects reverent POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore faith) signaled early, tightens via gnomon placement forcing trade-off between disinterment and renewal; agency in clearing roots forecloses doubt path with felt cost in integrated history, but abstract scale slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cycles emerges organically from bones-feeding-roots to journeys-as-seeding, resonant CR in lengthening shadow reweights family exodus without moralizing; counter-reading of pause vs. tragedy lingers via orchard cradle image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases toward solemn enchantment in root-traced glyphs and sapling-rib; rhythmic modulation heightens during zenith shadow without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ribcage cradled a thriving sapling") propels via varied rhythm; minor "journey" recurrence taught as pattern avoids loops, but slight overwriting in final reflective cluster touches non-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora return via bone-sundial cycles transforms exodus trope; gnomon-branch ingenuity grows from orchard particulars, risking quiet CR for high stakes without gimmick.</comment>
