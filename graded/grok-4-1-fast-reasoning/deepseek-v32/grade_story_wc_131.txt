<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Embodied sense memory upon picking up tape fragment vividly reveals character through ancestral skill guiding hands; paradox of invisibility haunts steps, compelling earned visibility at end with patrons' widened eyes. Minor label repetition of "kindly methodical" slightly under-shows via action alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tape discovery triggers memory density increase, leading to hand-crank playback and wall panel removal as resonant reconfiguration; closure lands with books arranged under dawn light, cost of prior invisibility legible in smile and talisman.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sapphire hush pulses in sub-basement during playback, constraining choices via narrow access and dusty conduits while charging ghostly voice emergence; recurring flickering lights evolve from outage signal to steady glow mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of visibility tightens via tape's imperative whisper amid outage summons, forcing endurance of crawl spaces to crystallization in displaying books; cost felt in foreclosed hidden life as patrons enter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerging via memory reweights through tape's "message from the past" to final cache reveal, offering non-literal answer in murmur of gratitude without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ozone smell and whirring reel-to-reel; rhythmic modulation from hush to pulse heightens dawning purpose without elision or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density in "curled shard of brown tape, its metallic sheen faintly gleaming"; minor template cadence from repeated "kindly methodical" and "sapphire hush" deducts slightly without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crawl space dweller uncovering tape to forbidden crisis books transforms library trope into fresh memory-driven summons; risk of hand-crank relic pays off in audible map to visibility.</comment>
