<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in traits like whimsy and perception, driving mandala work and interjection; embodied emotions via fingers in sand and tingling unease. Internal conflict emerges mildly in parsing chaos vs. seeking order. Final realization earned but lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from whispers to hush; orientation anchored early in grotto. Closure as CR via scattering mandala reweights meaning with impermanence cost ("She carefully scattered her sand mandala"). One tightening via "Peace" interjection suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto mist and sand vividly constrain choices, sand for mandala parsing acoustic chaos. Recurring tile flake and mist evolve, softening at hush; charges final image of thinning mist. Sensory hierarchy perceptual via Elara's ear-focused bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel whispers signaled early; Accumulative deepening via interjection "Peace" cadence shift forces hush reconfiguration. Agency in mandala and scattering forecloses permanence with felt cost. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of meaning via letting go emerges organically from mandala scattering and hush; final image of "new palette of quiet colors" resonant CR answer. Subtext in tile's fade avoids moralizing; ambiguity in unlearning lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature parsing "sorrow from fear"; voice texture poetic-rhythmic, modulating to calm hush. No head-hopping; diction biased to artist's whimsy without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion good till end; minor paraphrase loops in "lilac unease" (3x) and hush variants dull final third slightly. Dense info but some figurative density in peak ("whispers slithered... burst of panic") borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk artist, tile flake, and emergent hush in unlearning transforms lyric chaos trope organically. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hush from particulars feels bold.</comment>
