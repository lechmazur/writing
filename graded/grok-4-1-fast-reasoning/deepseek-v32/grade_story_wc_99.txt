<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in bonsai-honed hands useless before regret act simultaneously in the ritual confession; final integration earned by causal buildup of spoken failures. Voice-specific interiority via tree metaphors reveals flaws without hedging. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "nebulous ache" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of lace-guided speech builds to CR closure via compass light reweighting regret with emotional cost legible in "texture of her childhood joy, the weight of her adult disappointment." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via forgotten box discovery suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lace and compass as micro-settings constrain ritual choice and charge final image; sensory selectivity (wet stone, salt, cerulean light) reflects bonsai POV bias. Islet breathes post-ritual, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology's color) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through confession layering past failures; agency in reading lace forecloses silence with felt relational cost. Escalation peaks in needle's dance without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of diffused regret emerges organically from bonsai/lace particulars, reweighted non-literally in final blue light transforming severance into path. No moralizing; ambiguity in "not mended, but charted" lingers with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with bonsai-perceptual signature (trees as regret circuits); rhythmic syntax modulates from placid to charged in ritual speech. Elevated diction fits tutor's deliberate idiom without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but heavy figurative layering ("lunar gravity of remorse," "cerulean regret") borders overwriting in climax beat, slightly dulling propulsion without muddling closure. No loops; varied openings sustain ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of lace as apology map and compass ritual transforms trope of absent father into bonsai-specific arc; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable-feeling CR without gimmick.</comment>
