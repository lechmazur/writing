<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in preservation inheritance drives ritual choices consistently, with micro-choice to reach into vortex earning realization of burden. Interiority embodied via breath misting and cap texture but undermined by label-speak like "furiously tranquil energy." Final endurance of responsibility feels credible under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from egg remnants to vortex formation and fade, yielding Charged Poise CR where "concentrating chaos elsewhere" makes conceptual cost legible. Single scene oriented early; one tightening via seed's response narrows to textured understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound atrium with frosted dome and starlight filters constrain ritual alignment and charge final image of less brittle walls. Sensory details (ice groaning, vortex humming) selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (frozen soil, cap) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover borrowed time texture via entropy decrease) signaled early; textural deepening peaks when reaching into granular vortex, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost of "time borrowed was time owed." Agency in ritual whispers and stabilization coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation's burden emerges organically from seed/vortex/cap images, reweighted in final pocketed cap as layered responsibility. Resonant non-literal answer via "grooves on the acorn cap, each ridge a story" avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers in bittersweet texture without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (seed-saver focus on preservation textures); rhythm modulates from calm ritual to humming intensity. Purposeful compression legible under textural lens; minor overwriting in repetitive phrasing caps score. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "wild serenity"/"furiously tranquil" (4+ echoes) dull density, especially in final third ("icebound atrium" repeats, egg hatch refrains). Rhythmic variety strong in starlight prisms but template cadence ("She [action]") across ritual beats triggers artifact penalties touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy-reversing vortex inheritance via seed saver transforms tropes organically; granular time texture as sand grains offers non-obvious angle. Risky lyrical poise heightens stakes without gimmickry; irreplaceable particulars like cap grooves ensure hindsight inevitability.</comment>
