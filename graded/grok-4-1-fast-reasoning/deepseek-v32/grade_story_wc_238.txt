<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent motivation roots in personal guilt, intensifying through confession; embodied tears "cutting through the dust" reveal character under pressure. Interiority particular to her trade, with past flaw complicating reconnection without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as resonance builds density to RR closure in "sounds softened, resolving into a single... melodic line," reconfiguring shame with legible emotional cost of imperfect sharing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive constrains via pipes for circuit and rustling sheets mirroring memory; orchard hush and saw charge final image, with sensory ozone/orange blossoms filtering through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of apology tightens via current surge and vision, narrowing to imperfect resolution; agency in metaphor-guided circuit forces trade-off, cost felt in shared shame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fuller memory emerges from particulars like ghostly headlines resolving to pure aria; final "lightness of a debt finally paid" offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with musical perceptual signature ("note held too long"); rhythmic modulation builds to confession, diction purposeful and biased to her exorcist lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image without loops; metaphors cohere in musical pattern, propelling to peak surge, though slight figurative density in vision risks minor overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of gossip exorcism via electrical currents transforms tropes; fresh "psychic stain" premise commits fully, with risk-taking in metaphorical ritual heightening closure.</comment>
