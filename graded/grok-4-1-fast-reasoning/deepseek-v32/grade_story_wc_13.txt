<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism of folklore vs. trying pendant) act in scene; final sacrifice of childhood memories earned by prior mounting observations and resolve, with embodied pang of loss sealing change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echo anomalies builds to sculpting realization and CR closure via uncaging with legible memory cost ("felt a pang of loss"); orientation anchored early, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals constrain journey (pole upstream during still nap) and charge final free echoes racing through; sensory details (mist-bloomed fungi, stuttering drips) filtered via illustrator bias, evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace echoes to fix cadence) signaled early, tightens via junction density and knots requiring sacrifice; agency in pendant uses forecloses easy path, cost unmistakable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden harmonies emerges organically from sketches to uncaging; final image ("sketches included... sculptures of time") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with illustrator's distinct perceptual signature (sound waves "sculpt time," "bending moments"); rhythmic prose modulates from quest poise to peak intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("stretching it like clay") taught early, no loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in uncaging beat, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fungal canals, sleeping giant, echo cage transforms tropes via illustrator's sensory lens; risk in time-sculpting mechanics inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
