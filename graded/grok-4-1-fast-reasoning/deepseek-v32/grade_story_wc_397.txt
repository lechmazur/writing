<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and perceptual, with motivation rooted in perceptual shift compelling her volunteer choices; contradictory impulses in blurring death intent versus witnessing emerge through embodied listening. Parasol tip handling reveals character under loss pressure. Earned change in fisherman's sigh beat forecloses suicide path with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in "She had learned the sound... postpone her own," reweighting premise with undeniable cost of deferred ending. Orientation anchored early in marina post-waking. Single tightening in sigh realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina sensory details (creak of boats, wind-pine scent) constrain listening choices and charge final image; parasol tip as micro-setting mirrors internal folds. POV-filtered selectivity reflects Elara's loosened grip. Environment evolves with floods, guiding volunteer trawl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn ending sounds vs. suicide) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through volunteer beats to sigh reversal narrowing options to witness role. Cost legible in postponed death. Agency in patient listening forecloses original path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient listening amid endings emerges organically from particulars like lace snap and fisherman sigh, offering non-literal CR answer reweighting initial tourist premise. Resonance from patience folds without moralizing. Final image ties motifs with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in loosened-grip noticing (ice grinding, voice resonances); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity. Single POV stable, no leakage. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-pursuing (manager exchange reveals purpose).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (windborne solace) charging tone; minor paraphrase loops in reflections ("gripped reality loosely") but no closure dulling. Rhythm varies, propulsion ties to perceptual beats. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism into textured witness arc via sound-hunting; risk in lyric Accum lens heightens perceptual stakes. Parasol/ice images transform tropes organically. Inevitable hindsight from opening change to sigh CR.</comment>
