<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris's motivation as scar-reader drives consistent micro-choices, from watering the fern to touching the root; embodied thirst chorus and root-song sensations ground interiority without stock epiphanies. Final reconfiguration—scar as opening—earned by prior causality, with felt cost of abandoning healing illusion. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "closure was not healing" edges from pure embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fern pang to root crescendo, culminating in CR via hourglass flip reweighting time/scars with conceptual cost of eternal listening. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; chamber discovery tightens single dominant stake without breaks. No lens ambiguity; sand flow proves undeniable cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective details like coffee-ring map and petrified root-ball constrain descent choice and charge root-touch climax; fern roots and tunnel murmurs mirror telepathic bias. Sensory hierarchy (mineral-slow memory) evolves causally, grounding POV in body/earth interface. Final mug ring recharges motifs, qualifying 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher condition/scars) signaled early, deepens via telepathic chorus to root flood, narrowing to acceptance under Accumulative lens. Agency in prying door/touching root forecloses healing path with felt cost in "scar that allowed him to listen." One tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-stories emerges from particulars (rings, root burn, neural graft), reweighted non-literally by hourglass/mug reprise without moralizing. Final image answers "closure seeker" arc with resonant beginning-in-whispers, embracing ambiguity of patient comprehension. Organic from conflict; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (scars as maps/stories); rhythmic modulation peaks in root sensations without drift. Lyrical compression taught early (meteor hush) pays off legibly at closure. No dialogue; diction biased to histological/astronomical lexicon fits Aris.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "vertiginous chorus of thirst slammed"); rhythm varies for dawn calm to chamber flood. Minor metaphor density in opening ("meteor hush") purposeful, not muddy; no loops or scaffolds dulling peaks. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: surgery-unblocked plant telepathy unlocks buried singing-forest miracle, transforming scar-trope into world's map. Risky descent/chamber pay off inevitably; no derivative templates, bold Accumulative build heightens stakes organically.</comment>
