<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve wonder roots actions consistently, intensifying through patient tuning and placement; interiority embodied in "held breath" waiting and mind-painted colors. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning descriptive over conflicted. Final endurance as curator earned by prior causality without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to sculpture's activation and ongoing resonance; orientation anchored early in bluff/ice setup. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "wonder...a resonance to be maintained," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of eternal curation. One tightening via light/ice glisten suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bluff's winds, sun beam, and rare air constrain activation and sustain ice, charging final image of travelers' changed eyes. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's listening/tuning bias selective and purposeful. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal harmony without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wonder signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ice placement to symphony emergence, narrowing to curation endurance. Agency in precise acts forecloses failure path with felt maintenance cost. Escalation coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as vibrating resonance emerges organically from ice/symphony particulars, reweighting words' inadequacy in final "music *was* the thing itself." Subtext in muteness/silences invites ambiguity without confusion. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in essence-hearing and color-painting; rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity. Voice texture distinct in syntax like cascading chimes, consistent under activation stress. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "rods...expanded minutely" advancing action/image; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful without muddle in peak glisten/activation. Minor register elevation fits lyrical POV without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of ice-fueled kinetic truth-symphony transforms sound/color tropes via bluff logic and mute listening. Risky lyric synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes through irreplaceable fragment. No derivative echoes, bold conceptual commitment.</comment>
