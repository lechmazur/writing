<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulses shown on page; Elara reduced to consistent but label-driven traits like "perceptively calm" without micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via motif density toward CR closure in final image ("arcs stretching into the future, boundless and bright") with conceptual cost of pain transmuted; legible before/after but lacks one meaningful tightening or deepening turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (lavender perfume as "balm," sun warming skin) evolve purposefully with vines reclaiming ruins, mirroring healing and charging final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No on-page dominant stake escalation under accumulative lens; abstract "collective pain" lacks coherent pressure, agency, or visible cost test—factory closure mentioned but never dramatized as live opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing via arcs emerges organically from motifs but resists complexity with tidy resolution; overt echo in "through arcs...found a common language" borders thesis articulation without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in arc-focused noticing; purposeful repetitive rhythm ("as vines climbed") taught early as pattern, modulating whimsy without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("as vines climbed" x15+, "collective healing"/"transmuted pain" variants across paragraphs); template cadence (repeated sentence stems like "She [action]") dulls propulsion and obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fresh inflection in "arcs" as puzzle/healing device transforms redemption trope via photo mosaic; risks repetition for lyric effect but hedges into familiar artist-savior arc without bold stakes heightening.</comment>
