<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory skepticism and curiosity act simultaneously in the bone examination ("forgiving skeptic... child's curiosity"), compelling the ritual choice with earned cost in softened doubt. Interiority concrete via embodied tracing of bones and swelling yearning. Final determination to heal feels character-particular and causal from prior fissure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery (tooth) deepens pattern to ritual cadence shift. Orientation anchored early (dawn, garden, Elara). Closure as Conceptual Repricing via constellation reconfigures doubt-belief with release cost legible in "tears... of release, not despair."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden's roots, willow, moss constrain ritual site and charge final image of lights rising. Sensory selective (pulsing tooth warmth, dancing shadows). Mirrors internal softening without overt symbolism; hedge maze evolves to "symbol... of journey."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal via tooth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at pulsing discovery narrowing skeptic options. Agency in ritual forecloses doubt path with emotional cost in family tears. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at constellation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mysteries-as-healing emerges organically from bone-setting metaphor to constellation image reweighting loss. Final "mistakes into constellations" resonates non-literally without moralizing. Particulars like tooth dissolution provide counter-reading ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (shrewd curiosity in noticing tooth light). Voice texture poetic yet consistent, modulating to quiet determination. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("agreed, their eyes reflecting... hope").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short precise exam sentences to flowing ritual). Minor loops in "yearned"/"yearning" and "nostalgic innovation" paraphrase (−0.4), but density high and no closure touch. Propulsion clear via image integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fey changeling transformed via bone-setting ritual into constellation memorial, fresh synthesis of folklore and healing. Risk in metaphorical closure heightens thematic stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from tooth's early pulse.</comment>
