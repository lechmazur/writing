<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Concrete motivation to protect voices drives actions, but interiority relies on abstract epiphanies like "heroism was often incidental," diluting embodied contradiction and micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from erratic pulses to locket discovery; Charged Poise closure lands on-page as mist lifts and purpose crystallizes with felt ongoing duty cost, though late repetitions slightly blur tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist and hearing aid as micro-settings evolve causally (thickens, swirls, lifts) to guide path and charge final image; sensory selectivity (vapor, cold marble, humming aid) reflects Elara's perceptual bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trace/assure voice signaled early tightens accumulatively via quickening pulses to locket; agency in following pulses forecloses silence with visible cost of perpetual calls, but lacks deeper option-narrowing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of voices needing witness emerges from particulars but undermined by repetitive direct statements like "incidental heroism" in final paragraphs, creating Thematic Echo that replaces resonant ambiguity with moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pulse/mist noticing; lyric rhythm modulates effectively, though minimal dialogue limits subtext testing; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., "incidental heroism," "persistently curious," "reeling hush" repeated across ending) create template cadence dulling closure image; overwriting with stacked figures in peak beats obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh premise of heart-tracer via hearing aid transforms ghost trope into tactile lyricism; synthesis of curiosity, pulses, and mist feels inevitable and risks poetic accumulation successfully.</comment>
