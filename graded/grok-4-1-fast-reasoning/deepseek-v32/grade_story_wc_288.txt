<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied conflict (tremble amid sorrow/resolve), with earned change via holding steady during brittle memories; minor deduction for occasional diagnostic phrasing like "independence meant carrying the past without being bound by it" that edges toward unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from preparation to hum/projections/insight; on-page CR closure ("She stood alone... no longer felt isolated") reconfigures isolation stake with felt cost (brittleness/trembling); single tightening via intensifying hum suffices, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory integration (hum in bones, cool surface, tilting floors) reflects POV urgency; tidal library and sundial constrain ritual timing/positioning and charge final image; recurring sundial evolves tactilely to enable projections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory flashes and brittle trembling narrowing to resolve; agency in positioning/holding steady forecloses mourning path with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coexistence theme emerges organically from holograms/texts/ritual, with resonant final image reweighting memories; minor thematic echo in direct articulations like "coexistence meant acknowledging... without letting them define her" borders on statement over implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with consistent perceptual signature (memory-biased noticing); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short sentences in hum peak); purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "isolation/independence/coexistence" (e.g., repeated conceptual restatements in final third) and synonym churn dull density; some template cadence in "She [action]" runs; propulsion solid but artifacts cap high band, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation, tidal library, and hum-activated memories transforms extinction trope via specific ritual logic; risk in atomically reflective projections heightens stakes organically.</comment>
