<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between rigid past and chaotic embrace shown in workshop reflections and cavern choice; motivation intensifies through discoveries compelling the final worldview shift. Minor slip in overt diagnostic phrasing like "uncertainly certain conviction solidify" borders on label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of observations (leaves, compass, waterfall) building to CR closure in letter reading and compass-to-heart image, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of abandoning rigidity. Orientation anchored early in workshop/chest arrival; pattern taught coherently without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (ticks, salt-stained logs, bioluminescent fungi, roaring waterfall) constrains choices like hatch discovery and lock improv; greenhouse leaves and cavern niche charge final image. POV bias shapes noticing (tinkerer's eye for mechanisms in decay).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriending uncertainty) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening as coincidences form pattern, narrowing to improv lock with felt risk; agency in descent and pick-use forecloses rigid planning path. Climax cost legible in letter's failure parallel to Elias's life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty as landscape emerges organically from particulars (spinning needle, swirling leaves, admiral's letter); final heart-pointing compass offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries via earned ambiguity in imperfect rhythms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (tinkerer's mechanical lens on chaos: "kindred chaos"); rhythmic diction modulates from meticulous to fluid, fitting emotional arc. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short tense sentences in hatch descent build propulsion); minor paraphrase loops in leaf/compass motifs purposeful for pattern, not drag. Clean syntax, specific verbs (snapped, fiddling, waded) propel without overwriting in peak cavern beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork chaos and admiral's intuition transforms treasure-hunt trope via tinkerer's flawed rigidity; cavern box-to-letter turn inevitable from established pattern, risking quiet CR over gold payoff.</comment>
