<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for belonging drives consistent traits and micro-choices like aligning the astrolabe; interiority concrete in sensing the feather as key. Internal conflict embodied in hand to pane feeling ocean weight. Realization earned via prior causality without unearned epiphany; Kael adds light pressure. Minor therapy-speak in "rhythm of belonging" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from feather puzzle to bloom ignition, closure as CR via feather-seed reconfiguration with felt dislocation cost. Single scene oriented early (facility on temple roof). No orientation debt. One tightening via Kael's sample syncing with Elara's charts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viewport glass and abyssal city constrain isolation, algae smears and bloom charge final image. Sensory hierarchy via astrologer's pattern-seeking (sonar etchings, bioluminescent ghosts). Details evolve causally (bloom swirls past ruins). Viewport hand-press anchors body in pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging rhythm) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to bloom as cadence shift foreclosing dislocation option. Cost legible in "luminous respite" realization. Agency in theorizing feather and aligning sensors. Kael's arrival complicates via shared awe without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as syncopated land-sky-sea emerges via feather-cosmic link and bloom image, reweighting premise without statement. Subtext in feather reprise from ash to seed. Final image offers non-literal answer with ambiguity (transformed city). No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with astrologer perceptual signature (celestial-submerged correlations). Prose texture lyrical yet biased (shadowseam throbbing). Dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual ("Found something curious"). Rhythm modulates to awe at bloom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (pressure-black depths) without muddle in peak bloom beat. Minor paraphrase loops ("rhythm" thrice in close proximity). No scaffold or template cadence. Final line recharges feather motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: landscape astrology in underwater ruins links cosmic feather-fire to deep-sea bloom rhythm. Transforms drowned city trope via personal dislocation. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes coherently. Feather realization feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
