<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to teach endings how to begin roots consistently in traits and intensifies via callers' arcs, culminating in his earned shift; contradictory estrangement vs. fostering connections acts in scene. Interiority concrete but occasionally abstract, like "curator of endings," without full embodiment. Final choice forecloses isolation with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to pattern break at closure—"He placed the glass harmonica disc in its case, a final rotation"—a Charged Poise reconfiguring his estrangement with legible opportunity cost. Orientation anchors early; one tightening via Lela/Marco calls narrows his stance without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's "shifting pipes and ceaseless drip" and booth constrain isolation, mirroring internal cycles; disc as micro-setting charges final image by echoing lost love while enabling his exit. Sensory selection purposeful, POV-biased toward ritual sounds over visuals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (estrangement vs. imposed connections) signaled early; accumulative deepening via calls forces stance crystallization in Aris's decision to leave, foreclosing booth life with visible cost. One reversal tests commitment without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cycles emerges organically from disc/ritual particulars, reweighted non-literally in final ascent; subtext in "endings are not full stops, but commas" lingers without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in melodic/ritual bias; voice texture distinct in syntax rhythm, modulating poetically under reflection. Dialogue natural, subtextual ("There are no wrong numbers here"), advances stakes; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (haunted whispers to crisp final acts); density high, but minor loops in "melodically haunted" and "hum of streetlamps" repetitions (-0.4) purposeful yet templated. No scaffold obscures closure; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms relic phone booth into estrangement curator via disc's wrong-number magic; risk in ritual lyricism heightens stakes organically. Fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, no template echoes.</comment>
