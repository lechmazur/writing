<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maimed hand tracing geode embodies guilt and anchors motivation; bleak exhilaration collides in override choice, earning final renunciation with desolation cost. Contradictory impulses act in hunting despite sentence-like survival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: perturbations build to geode resonance and shimmer leak as CR; breakers' final click makes before/after legible with irrevocable confirmation cost. Orientation anchored early in observatory/geode/desert.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode and breakers constrain overrides and charge final cold silence; desert feed shimmer mirrors internal wound, sensory hierarchy narrows to hum/hiss/glow under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove pools) deepens via spike/geode song to override; agency in safety bypass forecloses power, culminating in depletion and felt desolation cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shimmer as "wound in the air" reweights "nothing lost" premise non-literally with no-suture cost; theme emerges organically from wedding hook and final twin weights.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("intangibly tangible scars") biases noticing; rhythmic compression in "geode began to sing" sustains pressure without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density in "pulse of calibrated nothingness" propels; zero loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (sonar/groundwater), rhythm varies to silence without dulling shimmer closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perturbation grief pools synthesize drone trauma and quantum hunt boldly; shimmer wound transforms sci-fi premise with irreplaceable geode reprise heightening stakes.</comment>
