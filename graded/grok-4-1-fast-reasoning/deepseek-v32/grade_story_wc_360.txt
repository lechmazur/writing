<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in analytical recording amid overwhelming sorrow ("logarithmic decay") versus turbulence; final renunciation earned by accumulated fragmentation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as borrowings densify to chorus overload; CR lands via halo shatter and star reformation with identity dissolution cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Topaz glow and vanishing stars constrain choices and charge final constellation image, evolving causally with Aris's dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fragmentation escalation under accumulative lens driven by repeated agency narrows to collapse; cost legible in "cacophony of selves vying for control."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>CR reweights math-mastery premise to appreciation via shattered halo; resonant without moralizing, emerging from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical diction with math-perceptual signature ("geometric patterns of pain") stable under single POV, modulating turbulence effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Patterned recurrences like "lucid turbulence" taught early but minor loops dull peak density slightly; strong rhythmic propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Empathy-transposing letterpress and halo synthesize emotional-mathematical quest organically; bold premise transforms trope with inevitable hindsight payoff.</comment>
