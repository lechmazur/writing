<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's watchful observation drives micro-choices like tending moss and documenting icicles, earning the pendant proffer as a higher-stakes act of sharing with felt vulnerability cost. Interiority concrete via embodied grief (moss absorbs tears), but occasional diagnostic phrasing ("graft new meaning") slightly abstracts impulses. Journalist applies timely pressure, revealing Elara's hierarchy of values in the tea-sharing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build density from icicle discovery to pendant transfer, culminating in Charged Poise RR as Elara reconfigures solitary healing into shared sanctuary with emotional exposure cost legible in journalist's tears. Orientation anchored early (moss garden post-confession). Single tightening via visitor crystallizes stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moss garden constrains choices (tending cables, herb tea) and charges closure image (drips etch lessons, sanctuary plan). Sensory details selective/POV-biased: thawing icicles mirror grief thaw. Vivid evolution from dead servers to living testament avoids generics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief transformation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via icicle symbol to proffer, narrowing solitary options with vulnerability cost. Agency in offering pendant forecloses isolation. Visitor complicates without resolving by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wounds grafted via patterns/pendant shift from trapped pain to resilience, resonant in final sanctuary image without moralizing. Subtext in silence/tears implies complexity of shared grief. Pendant reprise reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (pattern-noticing); voice lyrical yet grounded, modulating rhythm in dialogue (soft but steady proffer). Dialogue subtextual, advances via pendant explanation. No head-hopping; diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("patterns" motifs restated adjacently ~3x, e.g., icicle spirals/marks/maps) dull momentum slightly pre-closure. No major artifacts; metaphors coherent (honeyed hush, grafting). Propulsion strong in proffer beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: data center moss garden + icicle messages transforms viral-confession grief trope into textured healing map. Pendant bee evolution feels inevitable; lyric risk heightens stakes via pattern accumulation.</comment>
