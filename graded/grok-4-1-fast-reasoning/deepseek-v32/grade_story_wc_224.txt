<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to reclaim inner "shape of home" intensifies from frustration to essence-drop, rooted in glass-form embodiment; micro-choice of feather use reveals values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from stone discovery to tactile navigation, delivering CR closure at "shimmering drop of liquid silver fall onto the earth" with essence-cost reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves constrain navigation choices via nightly shifts; barren earth patch and "mountain's roots...like ancient bones" charge final seed image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake of accessing buried self tightens decisively at feather-method discovery, narrowing options to descent and plant with knowledge-shift cost legible in essence forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Seed drop resonantly reprices premise of lost visions as genesis talent, reweighting "buried talents" motif from pain to "thunderous potential" without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close-third POV stable with tactile perceptual signature ("texture...shock to her system"); rhythm modulates from thick silence to charged poise seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Density high with propulsion; shelf-migration metaphors ("slithered and groaned") vivid yet slightly overwrought, not obscuring tactile climax clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Feather-tactile glyphs and glass-seer planting futures synthesize fresh angle on lost magic, transforming tropes organically to charge seed closure.</comment>
