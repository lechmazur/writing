<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Phobia embodied in shaking hands and edge-standing drives micro-choices like beam kick; contradictory fear/resolve acts simultaneously to earn adaptation. Minor diagnostic label in "vulnerability is power" epiphany at close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: letter → whisper → decryption → trap; DC closure in Carl's plunge with phobia cost legible as Leo stares into water, reconfiguring identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted library and starlit water gap constrain decryption and climax kick; sensory decay (pulp books, gravel crunch) filters through phobia bias, charging final edge image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to outwit Carl tightens via note decryption reversal, forcing phobia trade-off; agency in flip/kick pays visible cost of confronting depths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Betrayal-to-adaptation theme emerges via seashell reprise and fear-won trap; final "trembling certainty" line borders thematic echo, reducing subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited via phobia perceptual signature (clenched fist, throat echo); sparse dialogue natural with subtext ("I know everything"), advances goal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion in "floor groaned, ground gave way"; minor "trembling" repetition and synonym fear descriptors in climax, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Phobia stunt double inverting mentor betrayal into water trap fresh; transforms vulnerability trope via library decay and seashell into adaptive close.</comment>
