<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Leo’s survivor backstory and mischievous trait root motivations credibly, with pyramid contrast forcing endurance choice at climax; internal conflict embodied in soul-pressure smile amid transformation. Minor label-speak in "virtuously mischievous" slightly abstracts without full tradeoff visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: messages → bolt → seam → volunteer DC with soul-cost snap-fit; closure reconfigures endurance-value on-page, diamond as proof. Orientation anchored early; single scene tightens meaningfully at rift-opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm and shadowseam vividly constrain climax action, fungal glow charging final image; sensory selectivity (pulsing light, thickening air) mirrors pressure. Micro-setting (bolt, caps) tethers choices perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor unstable promise) escalates via double’s warning and mounting pressure, Leo’s volunteer agency foreclosing collapse path with felt soul-cost. Causal tightening narrows to endurance trade-off; minor abstractness in "quantum promise" before embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-forged value emerges via particulars (bolt-threading, diamond drop), final image reweighting scam-survival into steadfast truth without statement. Pyramid double and seam fracture deepen subtext organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (mischievous lens on "ultimate trick"); voice rhythmic, modulating to compression under stress. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("promise unstable"), advances stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; metaphors coherent, glow-pattern purposeful without muddle. Minor paraphrase near seam description ("shimmering rift... vertical line") subtracts slightly from peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts-physical era, shadowseam, glitch-Leo transforms pyramid trope into endurance insight; risk in abstract-physics payoff feels inevitable via causal chain.</comment>
