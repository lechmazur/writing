<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris's dry wit emerges concretely in the muttered line "All that editing, and here it is, unedited," revealing irony amid validation; subtle confidence shown through patient observation and resolve without unearned epiphany. Minimal contradictory impulses limit to very strong rather than exceptional, as inner unease is told more than acted simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clue density (falcon, phrasebook, condensation) tightens to ridge discovery as CR, reweighting quest premise with ironic calm; cost legible in "years of piecing together fragments" endured to raw site. Orientation anchored early at outpost; structure continuous with one deepening progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Condensation pattern on window constrains choice by providing memorized map that guides trek, charging final ice field image; sensory details (crunching boots, puffing breath, trickling meltwaters) selective via atlas-editor's hydrological bias. Setting evolves causally from outpost to ridge without spatial slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (river origins) signaled early, escalates via falcon confirmation and condensation deepening knowledge under Accumulative lens, narrowing to trek agency; cost felt in trek's "days of travel" and task magnitude foreclosing doubt. One tightening sufficient, charges poise at nascent rivers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient observation yielding unedited truth emerges from particulars (window veins to glacier births), final image of whispering waters reconfiguring edited quest without moralizing. Resonance from convergence motif shifting to eternal flow, inviting ambiguity on creation's tranquility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (condensation "like the tributaries"); voice texture dry and precise, modulating to wry smile at climax. Muttered line natural, goal-subtle; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but "worrying tranquility" and "subtle confidence" loops (4+ echoes) create minor paraphrase churn without full pattern payoff, dulling some propulsion; no closure touch. Varied syntax, strong verbs propel to final stasis image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of atlas editor quest with ephemeral glass-map method transforms exploration trope; condensation as nature's sign risks bold ingenuity, heightening stakes via irreplaceable pattern reliance to charged ridge poise.</comment>
