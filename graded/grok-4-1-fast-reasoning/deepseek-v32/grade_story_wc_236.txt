<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation from scent loss roots choices like sharing her void during polishing, earning the witnessing shift; woman's grief forces micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Embodied tremor and calm contradict effectively in scene. Minor therapy-speak in "mapped the emotional terrain" slightly abstracts without cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fogged entry to shared stories and gleaming screw return, yielding Charged Poise RR closure where fog lifts but scentless void persists as felt cost ("world outside was still scentless"). Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene coherent. No causal breaks, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Water clocks' drips/gurgles constrain timing and mirror internal rhythm, charging final "dripped on" image; fog evolves from pressing breath to dissolving light, filtering POV urgency. Sensory hierarchy (touch/liquid over absent scent) reflects loss. Bronze reservoir and screw integrate tactilely into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional repair beyond mechanical) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via woman's story into Elara's sharing, narrowing to symbolic polish with renunciation cost ("doesn't need to clamp"). Agency in listening/polishing forecloses literal fix. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of integrating loss emerges via particulars (screw as talisman, scentless mapping); final image reweights "broken things" non-literally without moral. Subtext in silences/gestures honest, lingering ambiguity in incomplete healing. Minor echo in "unveil ordinary miracles" nears statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (liquid sighs, fog breath) biases to touch/sound, stable third-limited with clean free indirect. Dialogue subtextual ("Tell me"), goal-driven, distinct rhythms. Compression purposeful, modulating to hush at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("ordinary miracles," "trembling calm" x3) and synonym churn (grief/loss/sorrow) dull mid-section density; figurative density borders overwrite in polish beat without payoff. Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion strong to closure image. No scaffold obscures end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scentless repairer humanizes birthing screw via clocks, transforming grief tropes through occluded sensory loss. Risk in symbolic pivot ("just needs to be held") inevitable from prior texture. No derivative echoes.</comment>
