<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to find beginnings in endings compels micro-choices like connecting the fragment and tuning to absence; realization earned via discarded assumption about signal volume, with embodied actions aligning traits. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak tuning beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from noise cacophony to hush-enabled gap in pulsar heartbeats, landing CR in supernova blueprint with cost (dulled fragment forecloses glamour anchor). Single scene causality seamless, orientation anchored in opening gantry climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar perigee bends waves to enable pulsar tuning, constraining dish alignment; gorge wind echoes hush in descent image, charging final reconfiguration. Sensory selection (cool obsidian, electric hush) reflects interpreter's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture elusive signal tightens accumulatively via shard insertion narrowing to absence frequency; agency in precise dial turns forecloses loud-signal option with conceptual cost in rebirth blueprint. One deepening suffices, pressure coherent to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges from supernova cry birthing nurseries, reweighting premise in shard as space for new assumptions without moralizing. Final image of calibrated silence and new quest offers non-literal resonance to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "fantasy practicality" filtering cosmic whispers; diction texture (steel forest, sonic chaos) modulates serenely to revelation tone without slippage. Rhythmic control heightens hush insertion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action with motifs like hush/shard; varied rhythm propels to single-tone climax. Minor paraphrase loops ("beginning in every ending," "discarding assumptions") across realizations slightly dulls final descent density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hollywood star fragment as paradoxical noise anchor and shard of harvested silence synthesize celebrity relic with cosmic hush ingeniously; transforms abandoned tower trope into retuned tool via perigee physics, risking bold fantasy practicality payoff.</comment>
