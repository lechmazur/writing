<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but interiority abstract and declarative, lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; "benevolently ruthless" label repeated without visible tradeoffs in pivotal walking beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via successive word-spells tightening resonance to CR closure in final image of penumbra merging and Elara departing with chessboard-relic; cost legible in transformed luminous absence, though walking pattern redundancy slightly dulls tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Whispering gallery's curved acoustics and marble floor constrain patterned walking and amplify stakes; chessboard as micro-setting charges final image where pawns become echoes, with penumbra evolving shadows purposefully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unbind archive signaled early, escalates accumulatively through spells ("unbind" to "release") forcing completion of pawn paths; agency in walking yields legible cost as interregnum persists but gallery frequency shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures outlasting collapse emerges from concrete particulars like shared meals in whispers and pawn absences; final image reconfigures luminous absence from void to full record without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature of shadowy, acoustic noticing; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("benevolently ruthless," "luminous absence," "interregnum") and synonym churn in walking descriptions create template cadence across multiple beats; density high but artifacts dull propulsion in mid-spell sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of walking-words, nomadic penumbra as collective memory, and pawnless chessboard transforms symbolic absence into resilient map; risk-taking in patterned elision heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
