<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo's blank-faced rituals and whittling embody contradictory impulses toward mandated joy versus private grief, earning final endurance; micro-choices like smoothing the bird's wings reveal values hierarchy with isolation cost. Minor abstraction in "emotional void" limits embodied contradiction show.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density tightens to Charged Poise closure in "strange, light equilibrium" line, reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of resisted mandate legible on page; single deepening sufficient, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Turbines' thrum and "sweeping shadows passing over him like silent clock hands" constrain rituals and charge final image, mirroring internal void; selective sensory hierarchy POV-specific, purposeful over vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief cultivation signaled early, textural escalation via bouquet-bird placement narrows to endurance agency; cost unmistakable in moral isolation foreclosing mandated joy, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final "breath held, a space kept open" image offers resonant non-literal answer to happiness mandate premise, reweighting rituals without moralizing; theme emerges organically from particulars like shavings as "pale petals."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct dramatic narration texture ("water cascades like liquid diamonds"); perceptual signature biases toward theatrical mundanity; purposeful compression legible, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short declarative peaks in whittling); high density integrates action/image, purposeful hush/void recurrences pattern-taught without loops; minor figurative density in rituals but coherent, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian mandate with whittling stasis transforms tropes via textured rituals; risk of quiet equilibrium heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from bouquet anchor.</comment>
