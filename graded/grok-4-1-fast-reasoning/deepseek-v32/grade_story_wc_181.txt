<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in "serene unease under the perpetual blossom-light" and cameo vibration build to earned acceptance of sustaining wonder, but bathroom breakthrough feels slightly abrupt without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from mute cameo to visions flooding ("past curators, future tenders"), landing CR closure ("forbidden knowledge was the asking itself") with conceptual cost of endless cycle; orientation anchored early, one tightening via pressing bloom suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Astral orchard's "luminous, synaptic blooms" and "light pulsed in slow rhythms" constrain choice (pressing cameo) and charge final image (blossoms pulse brighter); micro-setting of cameo and sterile bathroom evolve tactilely without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge pursuit) signaled early tightens accumulatively through mute response to visions, forcing renunciation of solving for sustaining with felt cost in "role was not to solve, but to sustain"; agency clear in retreat and pressing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of questions as knowledge emerges organically from visions and orchard storing "questions more than answers," resonating in final placement of cameo without overt moralizing; weakened by near-explicit lines like "inheritance is a network, not a path" bordering on statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("whispered knowledge," "brightened disquiet"); rhythmic modulation suits lyrical accumulative lens, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn in final third ("brightened disquiet settled... remained... gentle fuel"; multiple restatements of epiphany as network/cycle) dull closure propulsion and create template cadence; density suffers from redundancy over advancement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synaptic orchard storing questions and pistachio cameo as nonlinear key transforms tropes into inevitable CR; bathroom portal for legacy insight risks bold ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
