<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to ground spirits clear and intensifies through secrets shared before each unraveling; interiority embodied in skin-pressed silence but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building knot-by-knot to captain's knot closure; RR lands on-page as light erupts and silence peaks with felt weight of centuries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism starlight refracts colors that "guide her hands, illuminating the intricate knots," constraining choice and charging climax glow; selective sensory weave fits urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to free spirits escalates via hush thickening and final turbulent knot under accumulative lens, narrowing to one poised needle with visible pull-of-centuries cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of grounding unrest emerges organically from unraveling and secrets; final spirits merging with starlight offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature in weave metaphors; whispers carry subtext and advance ritual without unnatural exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("accumulated silence," "interlaced hush," "across sharing") and synonym churn dull propulsion across multiple beats, including near closure; template cadence in descriptive sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask-restorer exhuming spirits via net knots transforms supernatural tropes through ritual specificity; captain's regret knot feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
