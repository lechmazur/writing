<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptions embodied and particular, fueling motivation to heal timeline; internal conflict peaks in nostalgia's overwhelm during final echo, compelling endurance with felt focus cost. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more summarized than simultaneous in early beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early anchors (Elara in orchard post-closing) clear by 100 words; density of echoes builds to RR closure as timeline "snaps into place" with overwhelm risk as cost. One tightening via rising nostalgia suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's fruits glow and trees become audience, constraining ritual and charging transformed-stage closure image; synesthetic filter (tasting bronze lights) biases details purposefully. Sensory integration vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal fractured timeline vs. despair/nostalgia) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as echoes braid with overwhelm threat forcing embrace; agency in singing/channeling forecloses despair path at climax with focus cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia luring possibility emerges organically from echoes merging past/present; final encore bow reconfigures despair into joy without moralizing, resonant via orchard-stage image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (tasting colors, hearing time); lyrical rhythm modulates from hum to roar, consistent diction fits ethereal ghost without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Purposeful echo repetition taught early accumulates texture without loop penalty; minor overwriting in synesthesia metaphors ("vivid, overlapping hues") slightly dulls peak density, but rhythm propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic ghost ritual with tarot echoes transforms trope of haunted performer; risk in accumulative fantasy pays off as orchard-stage reconfiguration feels inevitable.</comment>
