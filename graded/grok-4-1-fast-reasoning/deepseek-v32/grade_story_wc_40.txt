<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reticent scholar's motivation to decode growth intensifies credibly to testimony, with reticence yielding to sharing as earned change. Internal conflict subtle but shown via arduous patience amid chaos. Minor weakness in embodied emotions, more poetic than visceral, e.g., "weathered innocence" feels abstract without contradictory impulses acting in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from crystal discovery to sonic patterns, tightening to public testimony CR with cost of broken reticence. Orientation anchored early in library/dawn/post-dictionary world. Closure reconfigures static language premise via on-page projection of sounds, legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn vividly selective (absorbed footsteps, dawn on crystal), sensory hierarchy sonic-focused via Elias's priorities. Crystal as micro-setting constrains alignments and charges final projection. Mirrors internal expansion without overt symbolism; evolves causally with discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode sonic growth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries (botanical hum to patterns), narrowing from personal to public proof. Agency in crystal use forces testimony trade-off, cost felt in reticence surrender. One tightening sufficient, coheres to CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of persistent growth beyond words emerges organically from sonic discoveries to testimony, final image of murmurs reweighting premise non-literally. Subtext in hush-to-awe shift avoids moralizing. Resonance from particulars like fractured sequences, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sonic-biased perceptual signature, voice textured/poetic modulating to emphatic testimony. Rhythmic control in dawn repetitions builds texture without opacity. No dialogue to judge; compression purposeful under accumulative lens, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density early, but paraphrase loops in "fractured sequences"/"growth patterns" (e.g., repeated in discoveries/testimony) and synonym churn (expansion/growth) dull late momentum, −0.8 total. Minor template cadence in descriptive runs; no closure harm but artifacts in final third cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Core premise (sonic knowledge growth post-dictionary stasis) fresh synthesis, crystal transforms ornament to vessel organically. Risk in accumulative sonic conceit heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via branching patterns. No derivative echoes; bold closure reconfigures linguistic end.</comment>
