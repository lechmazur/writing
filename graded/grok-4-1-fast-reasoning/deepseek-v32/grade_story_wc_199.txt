<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving choices like prodding the speck and building the monument; transformation earned via causal chain. Limited internal conflict or contradictory impulses; "mossy delight" feels label-like without embodied tension. Spirit as secondary effectively pressures via instructions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore: prod → mist/spirit → monument → planting → arbor renewal. On-page closure as Decisive Change in sapling sprouting and Elara's sharpened senses, with felt cost of deepened duty. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor vividly anchors, with falling leaves and hush constraining choices via materials and timing. Sensory details like "rustling leaves" and "milky glow" selective and purposeful. Arbor floor pebbles/leaves guide monument-building; recurring leaves charge final swirling script.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode leaves) signaled early, tightens causally via prod and spirit's directive narrowing to monument/planting. Agency in Elara's choices forecloses inaction with transformation cost legible in "senses sharpened." One meaningful escalation sufficient under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory/renewal emerges organically from monuments and folklore, reweighted in final "tiny monuments stood as beacons." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like lunar seed. Protagonist arc ties to question of restoration without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent poetic texture; perceptual bias in "mossy delight" selective. Spirit dialogue natural, subtextual via folklore narration advancing plot. Minor repetition in phrasing but voice-modulated with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in causal beats. Repetitive "mossy delight" (4x) and "emerges transformed always" create minor loops, dulling propulsion slightly. No heavy artifacts touching closure; figurative consistent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor and moonstone dust synthesize fresh folklore frame; prod-to-renewal arc transforms tropes organically. Risk in ethereal spirit/monuments heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation test passes: core hinges on arbor logic.</comment>
