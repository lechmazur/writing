<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the splintered box mirroring fractured mind; internal conflict of fear versus purpose earns the shift to determination. Minor slips in diagnostic phrasing like "redesign his very perception" avoid deeper deduction as anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising through visions and untangling to Resonant Reconfiguration closure; cost legible in "acknowledging the pain, the void where Mara had been." Orientation anchored early in lighthouse library; single tightening via Moon card revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library and lighthouse constrain choices via closing walls and dust-shrouded isolation, charging final beacon image; sensory details like pulsing walls and shimmering shelves mirror internal fragmentation through artist's POV. Evolving setting from tomb to sanctuary integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redesigning perception amid sanity's constriction tightens accumulatively through fragment intensification and wall pressure; agency in persistent untangling forecloses despair path with felt pain cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of loss as tapestry thread emerges organically via cards and untangling, reweighting "walls close in" premise in final redesigned box image without moralizing; luminescent ache motif charges closure non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in artist's fragmented visions and tactile thread work; rhythmic prose modulates under stress, as in short breaths amid constriction, without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "rhetorical question" phrasing deduct lightly as not obscuring closure. No figurative muddle or scaffold in peak untangling beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot grief ritual in lighthouse transforms tropes via thread mechanics driving redesign; risk in metaphorical walls/threads heightens stakes organically toward inevitable reconfiguration.</comment>
