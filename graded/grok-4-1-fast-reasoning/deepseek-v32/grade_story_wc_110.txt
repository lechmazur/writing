<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to thaw mistrust drives consistent micro-choices like auditing and eavesdropping, embodied in his "painful clarity" realization. Internal conflict subtle but present in hesitation before action. Final commitment to projection earns change with relational cost on staff, though board members feel secondary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: doodles → eavesdrop → lens use → projection decisively reconfigures mistrust with admission cost ("We were wrong"). Multi-shard structure legible via forecourt anchors; one tightening at lens reveal narrows options cleanly. Orientation anchored early; closure Charged Poise with undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Forecourt's "wet crystal paving stones" and "resonant hush" recur to frame and charge final reconciliation image, constraining meeting choice via projection on wall. Sensory details (gleaming, whispering) filtered through Leo's priorities, evolve post-rain. Lens as micro-setting enables pivotal reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transparency vs. mistrust) signaled early, tightens causally at lens magnification narrowing to confrontation. Leo's agency in projection forecloses cover-up path; cost legible in Silas's "crumpled" relief and exposed wrongs. Escalation coherent without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared sight over words emerges via doodles-to-projection arc, reweighting "ambiguously clear" to simple truth without statement. Final forecourt image answers transparency question resonantly, embracing past error complexity. No moralizing; irony in board's misjudgment charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in auditory focus ("resonant hush," "soft click"). Voice rhythmic and literary, modulating tension; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("The lens is the proof"). No head-hopping; elision of details earned by causal reveals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, high density in key beats like lens reveal; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening ("washed sky") but purposeful for tone; closure image ("damp sheen reflecting... unburdened faces") clean and vivid. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of projector lens revealing financial codes in doodles transforms embezzlement trope into visual accusation. Risky silent climax via projection heightens stakes organically. Fresh angle on transparency via "ambiguously clear" motif feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
