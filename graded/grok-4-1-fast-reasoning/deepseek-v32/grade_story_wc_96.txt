<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted deeply in Leo's friendship anchors Silas's endurance against the impending molt, with contradictory impulses vividly embodied in "the old self itching to shed. But this project... skin he could keep." Interiority concrete and particular; minor slip in occasional diagnostic phrasing like "stubborn coal" slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through rebuilding acts and memory shards to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in final transformation of the tin and whisper "Rebuild," reconfiguring molt threat into rooted steadiness. Orientation anchored immediately in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted library and moonlit "luminous fracture" constrain choices (dusty floor, broken windows guide methodical work) and charge final image where "the fracture was still there... light poured through with more purpose." Sensory selection purposeful and POV-biased; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rebuild for Leo tightens accumulatively via time pressure (midnight room done, dawn nearing) and deepening molt threat, forcing endurance with physical cost ("hands dirty, back aching"). Agency clear in persistent acts; cost viscerally felt but lacks one sharper trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges organically from particulars like poem placement and library "breathing," culminating in resonant non-literal answer: "broken things could house wholeness." Avoids moralizing; final image reweights anarchy into quiet rebellion without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature ("corrugated roof sighing"); rhythmic control modulates beautifully under pressure, as in short, propulsive work sentences at midnight pause. No head-hopping; voice specificity fits molting poet without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, with varied rhythm supporting accumulative build; purposeful motif repetition ("bloomed," "luminous fracture") taught early pays off at closure. Minor deduction for occasional paraphrase loops like repeated "forging beauty from anarchy" phrasing across paragraphs, dulling peak momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting poet rebuilding with hidden poems transforms vagrant trope into poignant anchor against personality flux; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
