<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to persuade mirrors is clear and consistent, intensifying through borrowed heartbeat, but lacks deep internal contradiction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal humming and singing beats; calm trait shown via stillness at climax supports endurance without raw flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hum to mirror cascades; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with "visions faded, but not entirely. A soft afterglow... promise," legible cost in transience reconfiguring the terrace forever; orientation anchored early, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism parapet with rain droplets fractures light, constraining Aris's light-weaving and charging final dry glow memory; sensory details (damp air, warm stone echo, city's pulse) selective via POV, evolve causally to mirror shivers; no white-room, vivid spring terrace integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (persuade mirrors) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via one mirror flicker to cascades, narrowing to bell-threatened temporality; agency in song and grace drives deepening with felt cost in fading visions charging final afterglow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art persuading truth to possibilities emerges organically from mirror shifts and transience; final image of wider world reweights premise without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer to motivation; no overt symbolism, ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in light/sound biases; distinct poetic texture modulates rhythm from hush to bell wave; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image, no withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rain droplets fractured the failing light" advances setting/action); rhythmic variety in sentence lengths supports propulsion, minor figurative density in peak mirror cascade but pattern-consistent without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirage-painting via light/song/heartbeat transforms magic-realism trope organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of transience, inevitable hindsight from prism to afterglow; no derivatives, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
