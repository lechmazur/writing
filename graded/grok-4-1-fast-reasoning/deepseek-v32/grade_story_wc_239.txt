<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is abstract and serene, lacking embodied emotions, contradictory impulses acting in scene, or micro-choices under pressure; no blind spots or flaws complicate the path to unearned unification epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early pattern-teaching of spirals and inward journey building density to Conceptual Repricing closure; dictionary on obsidian pedestal and walls dissolving into light provide legible conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library pulses and shelves rearrange in spiral patterns to subtly guide and constrain the journey; dormant telescope in atrium and stone-ceiling anchor charge the unification image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling illusions tightens accumulatively to atrium unification with agency in speaking dictionary words; coherent internal pressure crystallizes stance, though abstract cost feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unity beyond illusions emerges organically from dictionary sparks, memory cascades, and dissolving walls; final blank pages and perfect stillness offer resonant non-literal reweighting of cosmic premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct cosmic perceptual signature in selective noticing of eldritch glimmers and nebulous shadows; rhythmic prose modulates purposefully from wandering description to charged climax stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm with purposeful motif repetition (spirals, hush) taught early and propelling to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—falling-leaves page turn integrates sensory propulsion cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic observer in time-lost library transforms trope through wanderingly exact spiral process; bold lyric risk in abstract serenity heightens unified-field inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
