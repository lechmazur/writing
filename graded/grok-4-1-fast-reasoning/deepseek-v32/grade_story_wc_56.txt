<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in solitary quest, intensifying to compel salvage; interiority concrete in embodied serene upheaval. Weakness: diagnostic label-speak like "mind was thoughtfully clear" abstracts rather than dramatizes under pressure, limiting emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from drift to grapple catch to documents, culminating in CR via hindsight clarity with conceptual cost of rewritten history. Orientation anchored early (Elara on barge, twilight canal); one tightening at "grapple caught on something solid" narrows to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity: water lap, fading twilight, radio silence reflect POV urgency; canal subtly pressures via rare-stop stretch and murky depths. Sundial as micro-setting constrains direction, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage truth from lies) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via instincts-guided grapple to documents; agency in lowering tools forecloses myth path with felt serene upheaval cost, legible in "hindsight clarity washed over her."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of lies' architecture vs. truth emerges organically from salvage and sundial symbol shifting to "time's truth"; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on ongoing journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of serene, myth-filtered noticing; rhythmic modulation fits accumulative build to quiet revelation. Minimal captain avoids head-hopping; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear") and paraphrase churn (multiple calm/training summaries) dull density, especially pre-grapple; template cadence in deck actions obscures propulsion at key pull-up beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh sundial-as-truth-compass inflects sunken city trope, transforming via twilight navigation to CR; risk in quiet accumulative revelation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
