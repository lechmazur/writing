<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust roots deeply in guilt and drives micro-choices like rune-tracing amid risk; contradictory caution/exuberance embodies in pounding heart and reckless plan. Kael's skepticism forces relational crucible, earning his counterpoint forgiveness. Minor slip: epiphanic "I see now" feels tidy without embodied cost, but closure change intact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rune lattice density builds to polyphonic climax, cadence shift at music settling reconfigures discord into concord (RR/Charged Poise). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via Kael's entry narrows to shared voice. Cost legible in "One misstep could shatter the glass," charging final empty well image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archive's dust motes, creaking shelves, and pulsing ink well integrate tactilely, mirroring internal unsnarling via latent harmonies. Ink well as micro-setting constrains choices (overflow risk) and charges closure (empty, reflecting shared image). Sensory build (visual glow to auditory cascade) reflects POV urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust pre-dawn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via promise lattice risking dissonance, forcing Elara's alignment trade-offs. Agency in rune-weaving and voice addition narrows paths; cost felt in potential warp/shatter, visible at glass emptying. Pivotal climax pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared truth reviving dead languages emerges via polyphony dissolving lies, resonant in prophecy reveal against hoarding. Final image (merged paths, reflected well) non-literally answers silence's cost without moralizing. Minor friction: late "trust like dead language" edges overt, but particulars carry subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (linguistic bias in noticing glyphs/notes); voice modulates rhythmically to musical crescendo. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You hid..."), Kael's counterpoint distinct idiom. Elevated diction fits arcane world, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Musical rhythm varies purposefully, high density in rune-build; sensory propulsion strong. Loop penalty: paraphrase churn on "interconnected promises"/"unsnarl" across ending (e.g., repeated weaving motifs), dulling closure slightly (−0.9); no template cadence, metaphors coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics as audible symphonies transforms prophecy trope via ink well's overflow, inevitable in hindsight. Risky magical realism (runes humming archive) heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, bold premise integrity to closure.</comment>
