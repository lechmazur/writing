<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in pacifist cataloging, embodied in fingers tracing entries like "silence between two heartbeats"; internal conflict subtly layers yearning for hush against documentation need; final empathetic tuning feels earned without diagnostic overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as tuning density builds to pivotal *click*, enabling page-reading RR (Charged Poise) with cost in bearing father's hollow resonance; single scene oriented early, closure reconfigures heart's frequency on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop under stars constrains tuning apparatus use and charges final quiet persistence; sensory hush (hum, click) mirrors internal states, fireworks contrast purposeful; micro-setting guides solitary choice without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to recover terminology signaled early, escalates accumulatively through jammed clasp resistance to entries' emotional deepening; agency in resonant method forecloses force path with visible cost in past silences revisited.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silences as unspoken truths emerges via particulars like "withheld apology," reweighted non-literally in "deep breath before joy" notation; fireworks exhalation answers premise organically, ambiguity lingers in wider harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with silence-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation from hum's low emergence to explosion's shared exhalation fits lyrical texture; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels from dial adjustments to pen poised; varied rhythm passes ear test, minor paraphrase in silence lists (e.g., snow/pine) doesn't touch closure; no loops or artifacts dull *click* peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh silence-cataloging premise synthesizes pacifism and resonance tuning organically; risk in unorthodox vibration key transforms lock trope, inevitable in hindsight via clasp's surrender to "sympathetic song."</comment>
