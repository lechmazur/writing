<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in fingers tracing charred letter edge, embodying contradiction between persuasion impulse and mismatch acceptance; realization earned without unearned epiphany. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "nurture intersubjective understanding" feels overt but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening parallels to CR closure; shooting star final image reconfigures mismatches with conceptual cost of inevitable parting legible in "peace that came from seeing things as they were." Orientation anchored early at pavilion/station.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory progression from amber sunset to crisp night air with earth/decay scent mirrors internal renewal, constraining reflection on bench and edge walk; pavilion/vines charge final watchful image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovery tightens accumulatively through parallels narrowing to self-realization, foreclosing rekindling; agency in endurance shows in lantern lighting and rounds decision with felt acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mismatches emerges organically via grafted vines/hailstorm parallels, reweighted non-literally by shooting star's "fleeting parallel to brief, bright beauty"; invites lingering ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature in vine-love analogies stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from mist-soft persuasion to quiet fire, heightening charged poise without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful parallel motif propels reflection; varied rhythm passes ear test, though minor repetition in "persuasive" phrasing nudges down slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard cycles as love mismatches transforms heartbreak trope; shooting star inflects organically from established parallels, risking lyric boldness without gimmickry.</comment>
