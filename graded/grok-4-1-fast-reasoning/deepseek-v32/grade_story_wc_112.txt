<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to prove sideways time is consistent and compels the lever pull, with embodied comfort from the mechanically warm console revealing traits under station chill; Elara's skepticism forces micro-choice to persuade via data. Internal conflict is mild—contradictory impulses not vividly simultaneous—but change earned via simulation. Voice distinction clear in dialogue, no convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of repair, data, nexus timing build to holographic lattice reveal as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting ecosystem understanding with conceptual cost in "entire understanding trembled." Orientation anchored early (Aris in station hangar, twilight nexus); one tightening at lever suffices. Cost legible in final paradigm shift image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: panoramic viewport shadows, bat-moth hush, nexus amber constrain timing and silence work; mechanically warm tools contrast chilly air, charging comfort motif. Hologram lattice as micro-setting constrains reveal, mirroring internal realization in final palms-on-console image. POV bias shapes professional notice of spore curves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via nexus peak urgency and Elara doubt to lever-driven reveal narrowing skepticism. Agency in simulation run forecloses doubt path; cost felt in trembling paradigm. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time and subdued awakenings emerges organically from lattice drift and Elara's awe, reweighting bat-moth/spore patterns without statement. Final image of serene certainty answers premise non-literally, with icy warmth motif charging conceptual cost. Complexity lingers in quiet revolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Aris with perceptual signature (temporal creases, warm glows); diction/rhythm poetic yet biased to mechanic's holographic lens. Dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Elara's "icy warmth" tone reveals concern-to-awe); no head-hopping, distance modulates at reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to lattice thrum; motifs like "icy warmth" purposeful without muddle. Minor paraphrase in repeated "subdued awakenings" but pattern-taught, not looping opacity. Clean syntax, strong verbs in lever beat advance momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nexus temporal folds and holographic lattice transforms sci-fi tropes via mechanic's sideways proof; risk in quiet CR heightens intellectual stakes. Premise follows implications to ecosystem reconfiguration without retreat. Inevitable in hindsight from early data curves.</comment>
