<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in family loss drives fervent conducting to climax laughter emergence; embodied tears and "mournfully eager" contradiction act in scene without therapy-speak. Final peace earned via process without unmotivated epiphany. Minor telling in early trait exposition slightly dilutes interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from roar to joy fragments to full laughter RR (Charged Poise) with fleeting cost legible in "moment snatched from time after time had ended." Orientation anchored first line; one tightening via echo change holds to closure. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tunnel constrains via amplification, mirroring internal softening; blower roar and wind sensory hierarchy narrows to auditory urgency. Pull cord handle as micro-setting charges final slip image, filtering through musical POV. No white-room; details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, tightens texturally via echo deepening that narrows to familial voices; agency in conducting/singing forecloses doubt with joy cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, one reversal sufficient. Minor abstractness in initial stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of regret-solvent joy emerges via wind-macerated echoes, final laughter image reweights silence with non-literal resonance sans moralizing. Particulars (lullaby, blowers) avoid platitudes; ambiguity in fleeting restoration lingers. No thematic echo or binary resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in symphonic metaphors ("base note," "harmonic waves"); rhythmic prose modulates from din to melody. No head-hopping or filter excess; diction biased to music/loss. Voice coherent under pressure, eliding backstory strategically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short punchy roars vs. flowing echoes) without monotony. Minor paraphrase loops ("mournfully eager," "off-key wind" reprise purposeful but borders redundancy); no closure-touching artifacts or filter stacks. Propulsion clear, overwriting minor outside peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Leaf-blower conductor premise synthesizes absurd grief ritual into inevitable haunting joy; risk-taking in textural symphony transforms afterlife trope via specific tools/images. Final handle slip recharges opener organically. No derivative templates; bold vision heightens stakes.</comment>
