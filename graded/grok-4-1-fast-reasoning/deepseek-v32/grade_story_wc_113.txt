<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo's motivation roots deeply in dream-inspired resonances and intensifies via embodied risks like diving into the submerged pit, compelling the final micro-choice of playing silences; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds flawlessly from stain-map to cylinder to unstruck chord, landing Charged Poise closure with emotional release cost legible in "the message delivered and received."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded pit and lanterns constrain diving and amplify vibrations carrying the final chord, charging closure while mirroring internal silences through selective sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of code-unraveling deepens accumulatively via clue-density to stance crystallization in silence-playing, with physical peril and effort as visible costs narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"In between spaces" emerges organically, reweighting sound/silence premise in the final unstruck chord image as resonant answer to ghostly communication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Musical perceptual signature ("hush of unstruck chords," "dampened resonances") and rhythmic modulation sustain Accumulative texture with stable single-POV confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and purposeful motif recurrence ("in between spaces"); minor figurative density in peak descriptive beats prevents 9+ without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Water-as-pen code and silence-playing transform phantom trope into fresh musical metaphysics, with unstruck chord risk heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
