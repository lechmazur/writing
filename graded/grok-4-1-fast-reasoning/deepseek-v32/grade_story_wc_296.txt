<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of motivation through "warlike serenity" settling over her, driving micro-choices like spiraling inward and feeding the seed truth despite agony; contradictory impulses (serenity vs. hurricane sorrow) act simultaneously in climax. Final endurance of naiad's spark earned by prior causal absorption with visible palm bite cost. Minor abstraction in "guarded heart" prevents flawless 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: ritual failure therefore entry, discovery therefore confrontation, seed convulses therefore ice shatters/vortex collapses as on-page Decisive Change. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening at eye discovery narrows to core bend. Closure cost legible in "agony, a hurricane of sorrow and rage" and crumbling ash.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "branches snapping like bone" and "pulsating pod" constrain choices (radial pressure through circles) and charge final "newly calm surface." Vortex as "vertical forest" mirrors internal unbending, evolved causally to settling trees. Environment as micro-setting (ice pillar, roots) shapes climax tactics and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover lost naiad essence) signaled early, tightens causally via eye discovery forcing seed confrontation; agency in "fed it the naiad's frozen confession" forecloses poisoned path. Escalation driven by her radial method under causal lens, cost unmistakable in seed's bite and absorbed rage charging final poise. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truths beyond mirrors emerges organically from frozen naiad betrayal and truth killing seed, reweighting "magic trick" failure without statement. Final image of cradled spark offers resonant answer to betrayal/malice question. Particulars like Blightseed avoid platitudes; ambiguity in her borne truth lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (druidic: "unbending the path," "radial pressure"); rhythmic control modulates from serene entry to terse climax chant. Lyrical diction purposeful and consistent, no head-hopping. Minor filter-verb proximity in entry beat slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "vertical forest, ancient apple and pear trees whirling" advances setting/action); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Zero figurative muddle in peak ("seed convulsed, blackened, and crumbled"); clean syntax/verbs propel to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: truth as poison to consuming Blightseed transforms druidic tropes via specific "frozen confession" and radial unbending. Risky warlike serenity tone heightens stakes organically; non-obvious climax inevitable from prior circles/method. No derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
