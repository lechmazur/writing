<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to map endless night roots in obsession and visions, driving methodical inscription; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with serene endurance over conflicted struggle. Completion earned via prior buildup, but minimal internal friction softens peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence layers densify from post-storm pause to final symbol, yielding Charged Poise/CR closure when booklet glows and star winks out, reweighting night as charted landscape. Orientation anchored early in fort/ridge with one star; cost legible in "weight of her retelling settle" and soul imprint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hush (thick air, marbled quiet) filtered through oracle's bias integrates with action; fort's sky-proximity and single star constrain timing/closure image, charging final descent. No white-room; details evolve causally from calm descent to deepening night.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map endless night signaled early, escalates via deepening hush and sequential symbols under Accumulative lens, narrowing to final inscription with agency in precise movements. Cost felt in obsession's toll on sleep/comfort, charging soul-imprinted map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of darkness/silence as navigable geography emerges organically from inscription acts and hush layers, resonating in booklet's glow and star's extinction as non-literal answer to void prophecy. Complexity lingers in tranquil shadows vs. fear; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature tuned to silence gradients; poetic diction and rhythm modulate calmly, fitting oracle's voice without head-hopping or withholding. Capped by Q7 line debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Repetitive hush/silence variants and paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple "silence after/of" qualities, backstory recalls) create synonym churn across blocks, dulling propulsion; dense metaphors in every sentence violate overwriting check without pattern payoff. Template cadence in inscription beats; artifacts pervade, touching closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence cartography transforms void trope into specific, tactile mapping; risk in lyric accumulative hush-build heightens stakes organically, with star's extinction as inevitable reconfiguration.</comment>
