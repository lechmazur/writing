<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover the truth intensifies credibly through embodied surges and micro-choices like gripping the shard during chaos. Interiority feels particular via synesthetic mapping, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal surges. Final transformation to shouldering the legacy earns closure via prior causality without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory densities and revelations layer to Charged Poise closure: "She stood among the ruins, a sensory map maker transformed." Orientation anchors early; one tightening via violent psychic current narrows to shard-stabilized delving. Cost legible in "weight pressed upon her, a tangible gravity in her soul."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Derelict bay and shard constrain choices (anchors body, stabilizes surges) and charge final image of Elara amid ruins with shard integral. Sensory details (ozone scent, engine hum) filter through POV urgency, evolving with multiverse layers. Micro-setting via shard mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via power surges and reality cascades forces redirection agency with soul-deep cost. Tightening at "violent psychic current threatened" forecloses chaos path, charging final stabilization. Moral calculus between knowledge/sorrow visible in parallel selves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth's burdensome power emerges organically from shard visions and variants, reweighting via final "mass of consequence, density of love." No moralizing; resonance in CR where pattern of knowing selves offers non-literal answer without binaries. Particulars like memory crystal avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (echo-locations of emotions) biases noticing toward multiverse threads. Voice modulates rhythmically with surges, diction controlled and purposeful. No head-hopping; compression in weaving sequences taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring mental embroidery; no major loops, though "weaving" motif borders redundancy but serves pattern. Minor paraphrase in repeated "cyclically spontaneous" phrasing dulls one surge beat (−0.4). Closure image clear, rhythmic without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic multiverse cartography transforms parallel-world trope via specific sensory mapping and relational sacrifice. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes coherently; shard's evolution from fragment to nexus feels inevitable. Fresh synthesis of perception-as-travel avoids generic sci-fi.</comment>
