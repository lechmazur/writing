<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solitary POV delivers concrete interiority via sensations like rust chill and bitter tea taste, with motivation intensifying through compulsive layering; final crystallization earned by prior collecting. Limited simultaneous contradictory impulses—pursuit vs. void feels accumulative rather than clashing in-scene actions. Blind spots (nameless void) drive mistakes that compound to truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fragments/pattern break via poison label discovery narrows to CR closure ("layering did not slide away. It crystallized") with legible conceptual cost (name forever lost, texture gained). Orientation anchored early in container labyrinth; one tightening via label-to-vision suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (greasy water, rust chill, spice scents) filtered through spectral POV biases toward tactility; labyrinth setting constrains movement/refuge and charges final image as mind metaphor ("storage system for cargoes"). Containers evolve from restless grid to steel home, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory texture) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density (label → sickness stories → gut-searing vision) forcing stance crystallization; agency in meticulous collecting/layering forecloses full identity path with felt cost. One decisive deepening reweights under lens without needing causal reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from particulars (overheard fragments, poison scandal); final image ("rough pulp... terrifying, beautiful softness") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting layering's premise without moralizing. Subtext in misplaced love's cost lingers via ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sensory filters over facts) and rhythmic modulation (lyrical swells to sharp shards); diction purposeful, syntax reflects fractured mind. Brief watchman dialogue natural/subtextual ("Aconite... nasty end"), advances poison link.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "connected like a live wire" sparks vision without overwriting); varied rhythm, no loops though "layered" motif purposeful. Minor figurative density in opener risks purple but integrates via voice; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic phantom layering overheard shards in container maze transforms amnesia trope via textural quest; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, with poison label reprise inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes, bold nameless conceit commits fully.</comment>
