<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zen-minded potter motivation clear and intensifies through calm micro-choices like breathing on glass, earning realization with embodied thrum in teeth; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal vision beat, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vision density and thrum build to CR closure ("oasis had already integrated every possible ending") with conceptual cost in sharpened understanding; orientation anchored early, no slips touch final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hive stone and sun shadows constrain glass alignment and visions, charging final offering placement; sensory details (thrum in feet, heavy air) purposefully integrated, pottery lens filters vividly without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance) deepens via thrum strain to hum under Accum lens, with agency in calm breath foreclosing chaos path; cost legible in reconciled layers, but pressure more conceptual than visceral tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation emerges organically from honeycomb repair image reweighting resistance premise without statement; final "held breath" resonates as non-literal answer, complexity in sharp gentleness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("centering clay" syntax reflects potter mind); rhythmic control modulates from measured to resonant in thrum peak, elision purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration ("poorly fired glaze"); minor thrum repetition across beats purposeful for pattern, no loops obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of potter, timeline fractures, and phototropic oasis transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric Accum design heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via glass reprise.</comment>
