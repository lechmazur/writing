<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied dance to inscription; interiority concrete in "skin tingled, not with touch, but with the phantom pressure." Subtle internal conflict in exile's costs balanced by defiant agency; change earned with transformation, though contradictions more atmospheric than sharply simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from observation to anchoring speck catalyzing chart; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (inscription complete, speck falls) with legible cost in "trembling and radiant" and exile's reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via speck incident suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting of body and moonstone speck constrains dance choices and charges final image ("speck...warm on her bone"); sensory details selective via POV (gaps between stars, jasmine brushing). Atmosphere tensions solitude with cosmic scale, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inscribe verse against ban) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via speck enabling personal chart; agency in dances forecloses sea-ways with cost in finite self as canvas. Escalation via density to final inscription; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of exile-as-coronation emerges organically from gaps/dance/skin images; final "quiet curve in the morning, finally full" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in phantom inscriptions invites ambiguity without confusion; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature ("obsidian grace," stellar rhythms); POV stable, modulating rhythm with intensity to charged poise at inscription. Purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm; minor overwriting in inscription beat ("chill bloomed, then a warmth...starlight condensing") risks figurative muddle but voice-consistent. No loops or scaffolds; clean syntax supports poetic cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bodily inscription via stellar gaps transforms exile trope; risk in lyric accumulative form heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from speck's anchoring purpose.</comment>
