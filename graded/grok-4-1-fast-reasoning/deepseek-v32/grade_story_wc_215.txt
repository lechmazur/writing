<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through Elias's shift from observation to tending lavender; interiority concrete in piecing clues. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with steady progression over internal conflict. Repetitive trait labels like "tranquilly perceptive" slightly genericize.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ghost observation to revival cadence shift. Orientation anchored early in oasis and post-Event world. Closure as CR in ghosts fading and softened sunset gaze reconfigures hope with felt solitude cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stained glass box and oasis constrain choices (tending from well) and charge final image (sunset hues). Sensory details like shimmering phantoms and honey scent selective and purposeful. Mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of covenant renewal signaled early, tightens via ghost gesture forcing action under accumulative lens. One deepening in oasis response narrows decay-to-growth options. Cost legible in ghosts' dissolution and his enduring solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken hope emerges organically from revival images, resonant in box's beacon shift. Final image reweights regret to guidance without moralizing. Repeated phrases like "weight of unspoken words" verge on overt echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in observant details; rhythmic prose suits lyric tone. No head-hopping or elision issues. Minor repetition dulls distinct texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops (e.g., "weight of unspoken words," "tangled covenant" repeated 10+ times across adjacent lines) create template cadence and synonym churn. Touches closure beat, obscuring propulsion. High artifact debt caps density despite vivid images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghosts-as-regrets and beekeeping renewal transforms post-apocalyptic tropes. Ghost gesture to barren hives inflects premise organically. Risks lyric accumulation pay off in CR without gimmickry.</comment>
