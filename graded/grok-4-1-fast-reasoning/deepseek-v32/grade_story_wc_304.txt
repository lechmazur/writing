<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in ritual pursuit, embodied in careful handling of emerald over heart. Lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle, rendering execution too smooth without micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from perception to infusion; DC closure lands cleanly in "A soft glow erupted from the emerald... last spark... captured." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via ember perception suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora and grotto constrain method and charge final glow; sensory details (rustle of robes, pulsing light) selective and POV-biased toward patterns. Quartz slab and low table enable tactile choreography without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pattern-deciphering to infusion with felt cost of entropy defiance. Agency in channeling wisp forecloses oblivion path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of defiance against oblivion emerges organically from ritual particulars, reweighted in emerald's gleam as non-literal answer. Final shelf-placement resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in pattern-seeing; rhythmic prose modulates hush to pulse. Voice texture (e.g., "lucidly watchful") consistent and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("radiant hush," "threshold of stillness," "lucidly watchful") create paraphrase churn across ending, dulling closure image; synonym cycles on concepts reduce density. Rhythm varies but overwriting in descriptive beats obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician ritual with aurora-static memory capture transforms death tropes; skyborne premise follows implications boldly to charged preservation.</comment>
