<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in embodied emotional shift from panic ("backup cable creaked") to solemn duty, earned via micro-choices like panning telescope; minor diagnostic label-speak in cloud categorizations ("Dread, tinged with awe") slightly abstracts interiority without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via storm approach tightening stake; on-page CR closure in final image ("clasped the brass telescope... repository") reconfigures isolation into charged poise with legible conceptual cost of preserved memory amid chaos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gondola and clouds constrain choices (shuddering limits view, swinging grips desk) while telescope charges final image; meteorologist bias filters sensory details purposefully (iridescent mother-of-pearl as "Sublime peace").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sky remembers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via storm "Gathering resentment" deepening emotional archive; agency in endurance/categorizing forecloses panic with on-page physical cost (gondola shakes).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of atmospheric memory emerges organically from categorizing ritual, resonant CR in "spooled wholeness... now held in the palm of his mind" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (clouds as emotions); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet catalog to storm compression, prose-as-character reflects crystallizing insight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops in "memory" phrasing ("ledger... script... echo") and repetitive emotional labels slightly dull peak beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology into emotional archive transforms isolation trope; categorizing as proof risks bold ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via thesis payoff.</question>
