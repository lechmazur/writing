<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's "creeping normality noticer" trait roots motivation in concrete observations, intensifying to compel sanctification; final home-tending realization earned via prior collections without unearned epiphany. Contradictory noticing of decay vs. aliveness acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from walks to ritual with density tightening at "something shifted"; CR closure in "he now knew why some houses felt alive" reweights premise with conceptual cost of personal tending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory bay details (salt, orris scent) filter via Leo's bias, constraining ritual on clover patch; streetlights and tide charge final hush image, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding aliveness deepens via shard manifestation under textural lens; agency in arranging forecloses ignorance with felt purpose-cost in "his own small house awaited... its potential pulse."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inadvertent sanctity emerges via displaced objects to shards; final image reconfigures alive homes as "keepers of inadvertent sanctity" without moral, lingering ambiguity on decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of displaced noticing; diction/rhythm ("hushed blaze") modulates to charged poise at shard pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory without loops; figurative density ("visible silence seemed to crystallize") coherent in climax, propelling to hush fade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Manifesting "shard of hush" from everyday objects transforms quiet walks into profound lyric realism; risk in subtle magic inevitable via pattern of displaced resonance.</comment>
