<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Affectionate skepticism drives key choice to take pill despite doubt, embodied in "swallowing doubt with the pill"; internal conflict layers as somatic recall overrides failed planning, earning final change without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: somatic density builds from shock to neural arbor to tapestry CR, reweighting stalled project with prior dead-end cost legible in "grant deadline loomed"; orientation anchored in first paragraph, continuous scene clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Studio workbench/geode/wand constrain choices (e.g., picks wand post-pill, geode reprises to charge final image); body-as-microsetting (tingling thumb, micro-tremors) mirrors fractal neural map, sensory hierarchy vivid under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breakthrough amid deadline) tightens via pill-induced somatic turn narrowing planned patterns to body-guided light; agency in exposure/testing forecloses dead ends, cost felt in dimmed motivation reweighted at composite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final tapestry/CR offers non-literal answer to illuminating hidden pathways via somatic/fractal darkness; resonance from geode-pill arbor progression avoids moralizing, counter-reading in "fragile" hope lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (photon sanctuary to tomb, nerve hum to arbor) modulates rhythm with intensity; purposeful diction (willowglass, fractally precise) biases to artist's eye without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "trace that somatic memory in the air" does image/action/turn); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (guttering candle to captive star) without muddle in peak painting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of CogniRecall pill + somatic light-painting transforms telepathy trope into embodied memory map; risk in fractal analog/geode talisman feels inevitable, heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
