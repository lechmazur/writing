<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to bridge wisdom intensifies credibly through embodied actions like fingering the ribbon and crafting the eyepiece, earning her final clarity. Internal conflict surfaces in doubting the Guild yet persisting, with micro-choices revealing values. Minor label-speak ("endearingly feisty," "feisty spirit") slightly undercuts particularity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (bag, journal, ritual) build density to CR closure in the eyepiece vision, reweighting vows with conceptual cost of shedding rigidity. Single scene anchors orientation by para 2; one tightening via journal suffices. Persistent constraint of forgotten tools shapes tactics to finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard details (unripe apples, thorns, dew) supply ritual resources, constraining choices; stained glass hues mirror visions, charging the rose window climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects mender's eye (sharp scanning, dew vial). Specificity anchors without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore true vision post-breach) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via journal/ritual, narrowing to renunciation of Guild vows with felt cost in "freed from rigid expectations." Agency in gathering/infusing elements drives escalation. Minor abstractness in initial stakes slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deciduous vows emerge organically from journal/events, resolved non-literally in visions merging generations, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in ribbon/visions bridges past-present with ambiguity (Guild may not listen). Final image offers resonant CR answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (discerning eyes on orchard/quartz). Prose texture modulates rhythmically from scanning to focused crafting. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits mender's practical idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dense, propulsive lines integrate action/sensory (e.g., "vines heavy with unripe fruit draped"); varied syntax breathes with reflection-to-ritual shift. Minor paraphrase loops ("wisdom" recurrences, "persist") and repetitive stems slightly drag mid-section without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quartz-eye mender in rafter orchard transforms fantasy tropes via grounded ritual and generational CR. Fresh synthesis of cathedral decay/nature's reclaim feels inevitable; risk in visionary close charges stakes organically.</comment>
