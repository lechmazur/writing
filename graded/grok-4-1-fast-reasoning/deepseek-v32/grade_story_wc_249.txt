<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of sorrow and hope embodied in purposeful drumming against memory invasion compel the weaving choice with felt cost. Interiority particular through tactile mantra grounding self amid "cacophony of pasts not his own." Final endurance of auroral sorrow forecloses erasure path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from taps to syncopated rhythm, garden responses tighten to RR/Charged Poise closure as memories "settled into a single, peaceful narrative" with sorrow's cost legible. Single scene, orientation anchored early in garden/lagoon. No slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains choices (dipping fingers elicits ripples; rim-drumming triggers glow) and charges final image of dancing light. Sensory hierarchy via Leo's bias (lagoon mirrors "auroral sorrow"); details tactile (reeds bend, orbs cluster). Vivid integration avoids catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave shared dream) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as drumming elicits garden response, narrowing to manifestation with sorrow cost. Agency in escalating rhythm forecloses chaos path. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of turning prison into gift emerges organically from drumming-weaving particulars; final image of "entangled memories settled into a single, peaceful narrative" reweights premise without moral. Resonance from sorrow-edged hope lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in vibrational synesthesia ("audible light," "visual sigh"). Rhythmic diction modulates with intensity; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short declarative peaks in drumming beats); high density integrates image/action. Minor overwrite in opening "universe inhaling" simile strains slightly, but pattern-taught lyric mode coheres without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma therapy, sonic garden physics, memory-weaving rebellion transforms sci-fi tropes via drumming rebellion. Bold lyric risk heightens cosmic stakes; premise implications followed to "prison into a gift" without retreat.</comment>
