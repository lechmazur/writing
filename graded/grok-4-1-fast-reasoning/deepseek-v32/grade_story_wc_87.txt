<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied regrets (chest pressure, tears at marker) and micro-choices (paddling by poles, throwing compass) earn the change; contradictory impulses show in clinging then jettisoning compass. Minor slip: "merrily melancholic" labels trait twice without deepening tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog density builds to marker confrontation, closure as RR via throwing compass (felt cost: shedding anchor) with legible before/after in final paddle home. Orientation anchored early at launch; one tightening at lost poles suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poles and compass constrain choices (sighting line, then throwing for freedom), fog sensory hierarchy narrows to immediacies, charging final image of poles on headland. Vivid, selective: cold shallows, rusted marker mirror wreckage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align heart/action) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via thickening fog/missed marker surge narrowing to renunciation; agency in throwing forecloses past with on-page lightness cost, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of wreckage-to-rebirth emerges organically from poles/compass shift, final image (walking under poles) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting regrets without moralizing. Subtext in humble markers vs. celestial pretensions lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (nautical regrets, fog as failure); voice texture melancholic-poetic modulates to raw scream then firm strokes. No dialogue; rhythmic control holds under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "backlash of regrets"/"merrily melancholic" (3+ echoes dull density); figurative density (dead star, riptides) overwrites peak at marker without payoff, obscuring propulsion there.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: utility poles as absurd salvation transforms failed navigator trope, throwing compass turn inevitable from prior wreckage; risk in fog disorientation pays off coherently.</comment>
