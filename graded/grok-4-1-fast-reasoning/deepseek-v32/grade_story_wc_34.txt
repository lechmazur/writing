<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in articulating ghost's needs compels escalating stamps under storm pressure; embodied actions like iron biting palm reveal attuned heart. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal stamping beats, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as glyph density and mist patterns build to Resonant Reconfiguration; closure lands with cost in "profound, vacuum silence" and lighter air after thunder crash. One tightening via shortening intervals suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and storm constrain choices via mossy tiles and lightning intervals; charges final image of still courtyard and sleeping purr. Sensory details selective and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to release ghost tightens accumulatively as storm quickens intervals, forcing faster stamps; agency in glyph encoding forecloses inaction with physical cost in biting palm and crash. Cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of articulating silent yearnings emerges organically via glyphs-into-phantoms; resonant non-literal close in new song with listening ghost reweights neglect into quiet integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "tinkersong wonder" and rhythmic modulation under stress; stable single-POV with biased noticing of hums and chimes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied rhythm; minor figurative density in peak storm beats ("spear of white fire") without muddle. No loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-in-code with storm-timed graffiti encoding transforms tropes; risk in technical-magic storm communion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
