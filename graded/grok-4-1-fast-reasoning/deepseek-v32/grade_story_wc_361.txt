<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jittery traits embodied concretely in "hands never quite steady" and "jittery fingers," evolving to "hands... were steady" via earned realization; internal conflict between routine duty and exposure shows in proceeding despite ache. Final endurance of courier role with crystallized motivation forecloses jitter path with visible cost in steady pulse. Minor epiphanic summary in vision dilutes peak pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from thrum to vision to garden sprouting, reweighting delivery stake; closure as Conceptual Repricing in "routine delivery was the essential trigger" with cost in crumbling pendant and spent garden. Orientation anchored early in ridgeway delivery. Vision beat links shards legibly without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora and moss constrain choice, pooling energy for germination and charging final "hardy shoot" image; sensory hierarchy (teeth ache, vibration in bones) filters via courier's jittery perception. Details evolve causally (moss glows, shoots push). Recurring aurora subtly mirrors internal shift from wind-exposed nerve to vibrating stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax wonder from routine delivery) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative density (pendant note sustains moment → garden bursts), narrowing to germination agency with trade-off cost in artifact's fulfillment. Vision deepens knowledge, forcing stance crystallization. Minor abstraction in initial stakes declaration slightly mutes visceral tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder germinating from routine emerges organically via pendant vision and garden cycle, reweighting premise in final "wonder waited, patient as a seed"; resonant non-literal answer in steady hands and spore release avoids moralizing. Particulars like dragonfly wing shift meaning without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in tactile vibrations and auroral hum; rhythmic modulation accelerates in germination ("pushed upward... with impossible speed"). Lyrical diction purposeful and taught early, legible under Accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and vibration (e.g., "humming a pure, clear note that seemed to stretch the moment"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening aurora risks overwrite but serves textural buildup to closure. Clean propulsion to spore release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier mythos where delivery triggers eternal garden cycle, transforming relic trope via sympathetic vibration and seed logic; risk in timeframe fade heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in "sparks that wake the world" from prior particulars. Non-obvious germination key elevates beyond fantasy template.</comment>
