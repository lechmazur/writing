<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in singular drive intensifies through micro-choices like cutting power and plunging the arrow; embodied reactions (cool arrow against skin, pulsing moss with heartbeat) reveal character under pressure. Final act as protector forecloses inert arrow with felt cost. Limited contradictory impulses reduce depth in pivotal cavern moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: water flow guides to cavern (inciting), arrow activates echoes (climax DC) with inert tip as legible cost in final lines. Single continuous scene oriented early (pilot, arches, inversion by para 2). Closure reconfigures orchards visibly on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches, upward rivers, bioluminescent moss constrain navigation and charge climax pool; inversion water cradles ascent, mirroring internal awe. Sensory hierarchy (muffled silence, spinning air, pulsing glow) narrows with inversion urgency. Recurring flow anchors spatial choreography cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience source) signaled early, tightens via cavern vibration deepening to arrow plunge under causal lens; agency forecloses arrow's latency with planetary wave cost. One reversal (echoes condense) narrows options coherently. Minor abstractness in "legends" before test slightly mutes early pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resilience emerges from echoes' cumulative memories, reweighted in green shockwave without statement; final peace image answers cyclic rebirth non-literally. Organic via particulars (arrow conduit, history swirls). No moralizing, ambiguity in future need lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with pilot perceptual bias (scanning flows, sensing vibrations); diction/rhythm modulates from tense skim to awe-struck watch. Prose texture distinct (whirling silence motif). No dialogue; elisions (lore) anchor to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "water streamed upward, cradling her ascent"); rhythm varies with inversion hush to growth symphony. Minor paraphrase loops in echo descriptions ("swirls of light and shadow," "memories... every seed") dull one beat slightly. Clean grammar, propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted-gravity orchards, echo resilience, arrow conduit transforms tropes organically. Bold world logic (arches as roots) risks pay off in charged plunge. Irreplaceable premise inflections heighten stakes inevitably.</comment>
