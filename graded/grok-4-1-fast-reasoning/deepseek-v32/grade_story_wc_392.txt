<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's watchfully calm demeanor masks turmoil effectively through embodied reactions like steadying against the wall after the memory jolt, with micro-choices to document despite agency pressure earning her final public submission. Minor slips in label-speak ("fortified vulnerability") feel slightly diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (lantern, scuff marks, notes) build density to Conceptual Repricing closure in public report submission and museum image, with cost legible in "repercussions would reverberate." Orientation anchored early in tunnel post-drought; one tightening via leak realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tunnel's damp pipes, grime, water stains, and scuff marks selectively constrain investigation (lantern position relative to body), mirroring Elara's enduring vulnerability; flashlight beam charges discoveries without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. agency control) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via clue chain forcing public bypass with repercussions cost; agency in empirical choices forecloses obedience path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Freedom from oppression emerges organically via lantern's past/present linkage and drought/rain wash of clarity, with final aligned memories offering non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with empirical perceptual signature ("empirical observation"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, elevated diction consistent but occasionally academic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated details, but "reverberate" motif (five uses) risks template cadence without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling closure image; syntax varies effectively overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh Underground Railroad lantern catalyzing modern cover-up via entangled memories transforms tropes through empirical investigator's lens; hindsight inevitability in memory-truth synthesis.</comment>
