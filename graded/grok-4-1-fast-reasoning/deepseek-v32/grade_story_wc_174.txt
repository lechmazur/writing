<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's tremor and serene cracking under self-doubt show embodied contradiction effectively; micro-choices like picking up the stick anchor internal conflict. Final confession renunciation feels earned from prior realizations without safety-hedging. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing during epiphany ("murky space between wolf and shepherd") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds from argument hush to dome practice to bar confession, culminating in Charged Poise RR as woman takes stick and Elias listens. Orientation anchors immediately ("Elias's pen... radar dome"). Two-shard transition legible; cost legible in "serene detachment... cracking" and public failure. Closure cost proof: final "raw tremor of human experience" reconfigures his method with pride's price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dome's parabolic walls and "meteor hush" constrain solitary practice, mirroring internal ripples and charging closure silence. Sensory selection POV-biased: pen scratch, puppet shadows on concrete. Bar's "crowded, dim room" guides raw confession. Recurring silence motif subtly evolves, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling integrity) signaled early via Aiden clash; accumulative deepening in dome practice narrows options from puppets to confession. Agency in returning to bar forecloses prior method with public humiliation cost. Escalation coherent under lens, tightening via epiphanies to stance crystallization; single decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of messy truth vs. clever reversals emerges organically from puppet practice failure and raw audience story. Final image ("raw tremor... Elias listened") offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting inversions with human cost ambiguity. No moralizing; complexity lingers in "truth is messier."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature: calligraphic precision in noticing "dry scratch," "worn smooth" stick. Voice texture modulates from serene to cracking, rhythmic under pressure. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven ("tell me a story that isn't easy"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs: short sentences in confession accelerate propulsion. High density integrates action/image ("shadows enormous on the dome"). Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("meteor hush... profound stillness") during reflection, but purposeful pattern avoids muddle; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher-puppeteer reversing fables via story stick transforms trope of artist crisis. Risky quiet closure via audience handoff heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates; premise particularized through dome/bar specifics.</comment>
