<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation to teach breathing is embodied through scars and past with Elara, compelling the climactic link; contradictory isolation vs. knocking shows internal conflict acting in scene. Minor abstract phrasing like "purpose that no longer required burning bridges" edges from full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (mist, scars) builds to RR closure in linkage dissolving presence ("its form began to dissolve into starlight"), with legible cost of shared suffocation. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary and charred door constrain choices (mist seeps, thin air mimics suffocation) and charge final image ("door, waiting to be knocked"). Sensory details selective via keeper's scar-biased perception; starlight evolves from witness to integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach/defend against encroachment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via realization ("by cutting off contact, she had made the threshold fade faster"), narrowing to scar-link agency with on-page cost in felt suffocation. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of connection-from-scars emerges via particulars (Elara memory to presence link), final image reweights isolation as "build new ones" without moralizing. Resonance from "breathe... to release" avoids platitudes; ambiguity in ongoing vigil lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature scar/breath-focused ("lattice of old burns"); vibrational "speech" carries subtext naturally. Compression taught early as poetic pattern, legible at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Patterned lyric repetition ("loaded emptiness" x3, "fading threshold" x3) borders paraphrase loops, dulling propulsion in mid-beats; overwrought echoes like "burning bridges carefully" x2 lack fresh payoff. Rhythm varies but template cadence in "She [action]" runs weighs on density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh scar-linking premise transforms isolation tropes via grounded sanctuary logic; final reconfiguration ("from the scars that linked them all") feels inevitable from established particulars. Bold poetic risks heighten without gimmickry.</comment>
