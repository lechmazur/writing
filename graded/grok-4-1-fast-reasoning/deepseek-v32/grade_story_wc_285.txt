<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between failed vows and patient vigil act in scene via needle-turning and memory surfacing; final needle-offering earns closure choice with relinquished companion cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (fog, drip, light) tightens to RR closure in gutters' silence and unexpected exchange, reconfiguring promise with acceptance cost; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog wall and gutters metronome constrain vigil choices and charge final silence/image of clearer path; sensory hierarchy (plosh, chill, snort) reflects attentive POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of promise-fulfillment escalates texturally via light permeation and woman-emergence, forcing needle-exchange crystallization with foreclosed-transaction cost legible in horse-turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Palimpsest regrets distilled into acceptance emerges implicitly via layered memories and final exchange; horse-turn image resonantly reweights prior complexity without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of ambient signals biases noticing (snort, spindrift light); rhythmic modulation builds serene texture, stable limited-POV with clean dialogue subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels build; purposeful "palimpsest" recurrence avoids loops, though minor reflection paraphrase nudges below 9; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Yarn needle transforms waiting trope into mending/essence synthesis; fresh behind-path passenger reconfigures gloom coachman arc organically.</comment>
