<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo's observant trait and ceiling curiosity drive concrete micro-choices like dust analysis and tile removal, earning the closure renunciation of partial burden release. Internal conflict subtle but embodied in steady voice amid eerie silence. Childhood anchor tilts present without excess reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dust patterns therefore ghost whisper therefore ceiling mechanism therefore reassembly DC frees ghost with legible cost in "burden lighter yet still present." Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene coherent. Closure image reconfigures knowledge with persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust patterns and loose ceiling tile constrain path to discovery, charging final compartment seal. Buzz signals ghost shift, narrowing sensory focus. Circus decay mirrors neglect theme via tactile paths worn by "forgotten feet."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ceiling secrets/ghost aid) tightens via ghost gesture narrowing to mechanism, forcing reassembly agency. Cost felt in carried secret and ghost's fade. Causal escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Burden theme emerges from observation motif to final "embraced it as his purpose," reweighting premise without moralizing. Ghost's sorrow concretizes memory costs. Resonance in sealing cracks ties past repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited perceptual signature biases to subtle details like "slight shift in air pressure." Ghost dialogue natural, subtext-laden in "until the accident." Stable distance, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion; motif repetition purposeful without loop. Minor scaffold in repeated "weightless burden" tolerated as tone anchor. Rhythm varies, climax vivid at ghost fade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech/ghost-seer uncovering circus clockwork elevator transforms tropes; mechanism twist inevitable from dust/gears buildup. Bold premise commitment heightens ingenuity.</comment>
