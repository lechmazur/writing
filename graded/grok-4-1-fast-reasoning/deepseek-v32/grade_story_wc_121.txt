<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's defiance enables micro-choices like floating over obstacles, revealing contradictory impulses when a sorrow-self dissolves into mist; integration at mirror feels earned via prior retracing with embodied regret. Minor label-speak ("singular motivation," "labyrinth of self") dilutes peak interiority specificity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from viaduct entry to mirror core, with patterned elision of paths teaching procedural resets; CR closure lands cleanly ("fractured timelines flowed into her... symphony of selves") with conceptual cost of cycle-breaking wholeness reweighting premise. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Viaduct glow and labyrinth's thorny light/liquid shadow constrain floating choices and charge final calm luminescence; sensory hierarchy (visual pulses, tactile tablet warmth) filters through defier's bias. Evolving details mirror integration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-conquest) signaled early tightens accumulatively via deepening obstacles and fragile selves narrowing to mirror convergence; agency in retracing forecloses rejection paths with felt dissolution costs charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of multiplicity acceptance emerges organically from timeline vignettes shifting to symphony integration; final runes ("she was the drop... every life the ripple") offers non-literal repricing reweighting fractures as strength without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (noticing glow shifts, rune pulses as defier); rhythmic modulation under stress (shortened phrases at core) heightens pressure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("walls of thorny light"); varied rhythm propels to mirror cadence without loops or scaffolds, though minor density in peak metaphors slightly dulls propulsion. Read-aloud ear clean; closure image vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Procedural psyche-labyrinth and gravity defiance synthesize fresh metaphor for self-integration; risk-taking in tonal modulation and timeline vignettes transforms tropes into inevitable, hindsight-charged payoff at mirror without gimmickry.</comment>
