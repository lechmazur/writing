<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene when Aris fights primal thrash to stay still and release vial; final endurance earned by prior causal build, with clutched empty vial as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore from vial release to visions to glyph sequence and dais shift; on-page DC closure via passage reveal, cost legible in "crystal vial was now empty, the gathered hush spent."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Temple pillars, glyphs, and dais constrain choices like glyph touches and passage; vial as recurring micro-setting/tool charges final image clutched post-escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake escape signaled early via oxygen gauge; causal tightening at glyph failure ("Nothing happened") forces retry with turn, narrowing options before closure agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of overriding instinct for subtle emerges organically via hush-visions struggle; final CR in "permanent silence in her soul" and clutched vial reweights survival without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature tuned to silence/absence, e.g., "absence that pressed against her ears"; rhythmic control modulates from frantic bubbles to velvet quiet under stress.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with lines like "hush spilled out, not as a sound, but as an absence" advancing propulsion; minor repetition of "override" deducts but no loops obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious hush-as-silence-distillate premise transforms underwater escape trope via memory glyphs; vial's reweight from tool to "relic" feels inevitable and risky.</comment>
