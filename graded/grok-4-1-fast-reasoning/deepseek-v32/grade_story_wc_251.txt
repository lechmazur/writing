<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to rebel quietly roots consistently in his chess coaching and hearing gift, compelling micro-choices like chess diagrams for planning. Interiority embodied via the white queen's "cool weight," but epiphanies like "role... beyond the board" feel summarized. Final endurance of quiet strategy earned, though child-bird moment softens confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers, plans, lights builds to CR closure in candle constellation, reweighting mayor's ban with conceptual cost of "second thoughts." Orientation anchored by ~100 words (Leo to library). Shards transition legibly, one tightening at execution night.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Misty cobalt library and magnetic grotto constrain planning/reflection, charging grotto reprise under starlight. Sensory details (scent of paper, cave hum) selective via Leo's priorities, mirroring internal quiet. Final image of fireflies evolves mist motif purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humble rebellion vs. ban) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via planning to synchronized lights, narrowing to visible risk/cost in mayor's "stir." Protagonist agency in organizing forces crystallization; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of amplified quiet emerges organically from candles as "visual murmur," resonating in final tradition without moralizing. Subtext in unspoken words plants second thoughts; child-bird image recharges cradle motif non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (hearing unspoken buzz). Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in climax ("one by one, candles flickered"). Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("bending... with light").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, but minor loops in "hush where past meets prophecy" (repeated 4x) and paraphrase in reflection beats dull propulsion slightly. No artifacts in closure; metaphors cohere (forests blooming). Purposeful poeticism avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess diagrams for covert planning, magnetic grotto whispers, candle constellation transforms quiet rebellion trope. Risk in non-violent dissent heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
