<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong emotionally rational trait shown in balanced reconstruction of chancellor's scene without despair, earning resolve; micro-choices like closing eyes at carriage spot reveal values under pressure. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: petal drop anchors orientation by para 1, density builds via parallels to charged CR closure in final ivy/letter image with conceptual cost of generational doom. Persistent constraint of site and letter shapes mental tactics; cost legible in "heavy and clear" settling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy and rosebush constrain her path (overgrown platform walk) and charge final image paralleling lies; sensory filter (whispering ivy, diffuse green light) reflects historian's priorities without catalog. Railway spot subtly guides reconstruction choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through 3 parallels narrowing to stance crystallization at carriage spot; agency in mental recapturing forecloses mythic villain with felt sorrow cost in "tragic figure" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from letter contrasts and ivy parallel shifts, reweighting premise in final stone image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to foundational myth via particulars avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with historian's perceptual signature (parallels in script, ivy); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, purposeful compression in reflections legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (ivy/lies), but "drawing a parallel" paraphrases loop 4x across beats, dulling propulsion slightly; rhythm varies well, no template cadence or muddled metaphors touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noble lies via lone historian's tactile letter/site parallels transforms reflective mode into charged CR; risk of heavy interiority heightens stakes through irreplaceable rose/petal frame without gimmickry.</comment>
