<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in scholarly curiosity, driving consistent deliberate actions like rune alignment; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or embodied emotional struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual density builds to CR closure ("sealed awakenings broke open... flooding Elara with understanding") with conceptual cost reweighting reality; orientation anchored early, one tightening via automaton's partial activation pointing constellation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's rune walls, dome constellation, and floating rocks constrain choices like telescope alignments and charge final glowing circuit image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows' path) signaled early with noon tension as tightening under accumulative lens; agency in rituals forces worldview reconfiguration with felt cost in expanded reality realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of bent reality as expansion emerges organically from shadow patterns and loop closures; final image ("floating isle drifted... beacon of quiet deliberation") offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with scholarly perceptual signature (e.g., tracing runes, correlating sequences); rhythmic control mirrors deliberate pace, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels rituals; minor repetition of "quietly deliberate" purposeful but borders template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spoons-bent reality and slithering shadows synthesize fresh fantasy frame; loops method transforms tropes organically, risk-taking in conceptual CR heightens stakes.</comment>
