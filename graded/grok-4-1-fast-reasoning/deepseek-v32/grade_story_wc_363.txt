<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Althea's singular motivation to send the message compels her escalating choices to sacrifice, earning the closure with felt cost; strength in aligned actions revealing her essence. Weakness in label-only interiority like "stoically sparkling with unshed tears" limits contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of weaving imagery builds to pattern break in the sacrifice, delivering on-page Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost in Althea's translucence and departure; one tightening via resistance suffices. Orientation anchored early in orchard and bamboo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard's moss, twilight, and bamboo veil constrain weaving and veil the distance, charging the final image; sensory hush and gnarled trees mirror unraveling tension purposefully through Althea's biased attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of message delivery tightens accumulatively as silence roars against the weaving, forcing sacrifice with visible cost; agency in feeding her life-line forecloses her presence, reweighting options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love's endurance via sacrifice emerges organically from weaving particulars, with final dual images of empty orchard and Carver's puzzle offering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; amber bead shifts meaning across the arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature in thread/time metaphors modulates rhythmically through pressure, stable third-person focalization clean across shards; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative density in climax weaving ("blazed like a miniature sun") borders overwriting without full pattern payoff, docking slightly; no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom/reality-weaving with jigsaw chronology and sap-shuttle transforms tropes of lost love into inevitable, risk-taking metaphor cascade; bold premise fully committed heightens closure stakes.</comment>
