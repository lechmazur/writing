<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in handling the tail tip and cleaning the workshop reveals contradictory impulses of guilt and resolve; final reconstruction earned via layered shedding. Minor slip in tidy epiphany ("fragile convictions were not weaknesses but opportunities for growth") feels slightly unearned mid-reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building through shedding beats to resonant reconfiguration (vial placement and smile); charged poise crystallizes options with felt cost of foreclosed naivety. Orientation anchored early in workshop under stars; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring tail tip as micro-setting constrains reflection and charges final glowing image; misty workshop's sensory details (wet earth scent, drifting mist) mirror internal shedding without overt symbolism. Perception filtered through Elara's priorities evolves with dawn lift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance self-respect/compassion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shedding layers narrowing to report-yet-rehabilitate; agency in journaling and routine reconstruction shows visible cost in tempered gentleness. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Regeneration theme emerges organically from tail tip's shift to vial symbol and shedding motif; final image offers non-literal resonance reweighting betrayal into resilience without moralizing. Subtext in Leo's desperation adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in color/texture focus (tail tip's "dry, delicate texture"); rhythmic modulation builds to serene cadence. Murmur to Kael natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "shed" repetitions and "reconstruct" variants dull mid-section momentum; no closure artifacts. Vivid specificity like "eyes moving independently" propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reptile regeneration metaphor driving introspection post-betrayal; tail tip's evolution transforms standard self-help trope into lived particularity without hedging.</comment>
