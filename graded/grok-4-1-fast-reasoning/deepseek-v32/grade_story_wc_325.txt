<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied claustrophobia peaks effectively at "the room seemed to shrink, but he held his ground," driving micro-choice to activate despite fear; contradictory impulses (terror vs. commitment) act in scene, earning transformation. Minor label-speak like "deep-seated claustrophobia" slightly abstracts but doesn't undermine pivotal endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative/textural dominant) holds: gold fleck density builds causally to device activation and phase release; on-page CR closure at "codex... blank, its purpose fulfilled" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost (invisible made seen, legacy transmitted). Orientation anchored early; no slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Forgotten facility as micro-setting constrains choices via tight corridors and tidal seepage, charging final "water rushed in"; sensory hush/drips mirror internal states purposefully. POV-filtered details like "throats" evolve causally, avoiding white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor unremembered) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fleck revelations and water pressure to agency-driven climax (initiates phase despite spike); live cost in shrinking options/tidal close forecloses escape, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisible legacies emerges organically from fleck-phasing motif shifting to "made it seen"; resonant CR in "claustrophobia... passed phase" reweights without moralizing. Minor directness in "keeper of forgotten tales" echoes but doesn't replace image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (claustrophobic narrowing to drips/shrinks); rhythmic diction like "crashing hush" distinct and modulates pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Patterned repetition ("crashing hush," "gold fleck," "phase transitions") borders motif but creates paraphrase loops in final litany, dulling closure propulsion; −1.0 for artifact spread touching ending. Rhythms vary read-aloud, but overwriting strains at "gold fleck now tracked the invisible tide of time."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of phase transitions for memory-release transforms spelunking tropes via fleck-tracking; fresh inflection at codex-to-beam payoff feels inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation heightens without gimmick.</comment>
