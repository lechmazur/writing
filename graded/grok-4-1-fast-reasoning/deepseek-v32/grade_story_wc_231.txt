<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eccentric keeper's motivation rooted in compulsion, embodied in visceral shock from touching flower; earned shift from isolation to story-keeper at dawn closure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses under pressure limits peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of gaps and memories tightens to CR closure where Arvid's serene certainty reconfigures isolation with conceptual cost legible in final dawn image. Orientation anchored early; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist constrain returns and observation, evolving causally to charge final sun-struck fire image; sensory hierarchy (glowing planks, lap of water) mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode via gaps/memories signaled early, deepens accumulatively when borrowed stream narrows options to Emil's story; agency in repeated flower-handling forecloses ignorance with felt compulsion cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bridging isolation emerges organically from gaps, flower token, and final reconfiguration; resonant non-literal answer in dawn certainty reweights witness premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (mist as veil, alpine frost taste); rhythmic control heightens memory flows, diction biased to eccentric observer without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid, purposeful images (water-swollen body, brittle stem); no loops or scaffolds, rhythm varies to accelerate memory stream without overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of borrowed memories via anomalous flower transforms isolation trope; risk in supernatural element grounded in sensory embodiment pays off inevitably at constable beat.</comment>
