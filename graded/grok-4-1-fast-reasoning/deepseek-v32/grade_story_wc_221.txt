<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ancestral duty intensifies to compel repurposing systems, with embodied heart thud and clutching compass showing contradictory despair/exploration; minor slip in stock "blessed pariah" label without deeper contradiction in peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sketch to surge-glimpse to realization, landing Charged Poise CR in "starfield began to shift... real-time reasserted" with felt cost of isolation unwinding; orientation anchored early, no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dilation deck and compass constrain maneuvers and charge final image ("hand over the compass rose"); selective sensory vividness (metallic groan, sluggish drum heart) filters through cartographer POV, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confusion to exploration) signaled early, tightens via glimpse narrowing options to beacon; agency in cross-referencing and repurposing forecloses despair path with legible cost in stretched-time calculations charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of orientation across time emerges organically from sketch-compass-true north particulars, resonant CR in final smile/sketch without moralizing; reweights premise via family custom as key, lingering ambiguity of "new era" home.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with cartographer perceptual signature (constellation geometry, coordinate plotting); rhythmic prose modulates from echoed quiet to shuddering hum under pressure, distinct texture purposeful without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short thud sentences amid longer meditative flows); purposeful repetition of "echoed silence" patterns tone shift to closure hum without loops, minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-dilation isolation and cartographic custom transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in temporal advantage heightens stakes, specific "lantern" alignment feels organic and memorable.</comment>
