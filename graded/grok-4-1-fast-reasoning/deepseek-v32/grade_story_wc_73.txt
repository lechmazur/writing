<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the balanced dare of risking misstep while gripping the rail; final endurance earned through escalating proofs culminating in the rupture roll, with visible cost in the flooding texture sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as proofs densify toward pattern break in the rupture stutter; CR closure lands on-page in the three-heartbeat suspension where texture floods back as present cost, reconfiguring infinity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains choices via resonant railings and central column grip; recurring dice charge final image when chipped one warms post-rupture, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map regret texture tightens via agency in paradox proof and die roll under Accumulative lens; unmistakable cost in the stutter's crushing weight felt during suspension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of pocketing warm die and resuming climb offers resonant answer to regret's integration, reweighting perpetual ascent as "permanent, proven part of the structure" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in geometric-textural noticing (e.g., "recursive loops," "jagged beauty"); rhythmic control heightens rupture with "tearing silk" and thin smile crack under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative texture ("fed on its own descent," "calcified into endless geometry") taught early; zero loops, propulsion peaks in rupture stutter without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of math proofs, dice paradox, and responsive staircase transforms regret trope; rupture's scarred die upright creates fresh inevitability hinging on prior particulars.</comment>
