<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism drives solo pilgrimage with embodied curiosity ("mind buzzing"); shift to certainty earned via amber revelation. Minor label-speak ("academically rebellious," "luminous skeptic") dilutes particularity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: path/amber/imagery density builds to CR at "data began to converge," reweighting pilgrimage with orthodoxy-challenge cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" and "rainwashed tower" selectively sensory-anchor choices (follows footprints) and charge epiphany image; sculptures/amber as micro-settings constrain ascent/payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homecoming chemistry) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via alien-trail revelation narrowing skepticism to conviction; cost felt in "challenge academic orthodoxy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chemical-spiritual homecoming emerges via particulars (amber trails mirroring pilgrimage); final image non-literally reweights artificiality as universal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (scientific filtering of "bronze quiet"); rhythmic diction modulates revelation without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied syntax; purposeful motif recurrence ("rainwashed," "bronze quiet") builds texture, but minor paraphrase loops in pilgrimage/footprints descriptors slightly dull mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fly amber ingeniously synthesizes alien first-contact with insect chemistry/pilgrimage; transforms tropes via textual accumulation to fresh epiphany without gimmickry.</comment>
