<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through competent micro-choices like guiding cuts; embodied emotions in seed's warmth and fulfillment sigh. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, but change earned with seed's dimming cost. Final choice aligns with traits without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sequential essences to transfusion climax. On-page RR closure in "seed dimmer now, but not extinguished—its wonder had been shared," with legible cost reconfiguring preservation. Anchored early; single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (roaring falls, humming branch) filtered through pruner's priorities integrate into action. Parapet/trees as "thin place" constrain weaving choices; orchard exhales and mist-rainbows charge final image. No white-room; purposeful over generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. dullness) signaled early; meaningful tightening when sensing "desperate thirst" forces seed sacrifice under accumulative lens. Agency in final cut/transfusion forecloses hoarding path with visible cost; pressure coheres to charged closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation via sharing, not hoarding, via concrete weaving/struggle. Final image of opening buds and "radiant hush" offers resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like gold-rose-pink sap avoid platitudes; ambiguity in seed's future lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (trees as "tapestry of potential," pruning as "meditation"). Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity; purposeful poetic diction taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm mirroring action (methodical cuts build to "cascade"). Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; purposeful metaphors like "looms from living wood" enhance without overwriting. Closure image crisp, read-aloud vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pruning as interdimensional weaving transforms tropes organically. Heirloom seed's chromatic transfusion and mutual exchange feel inevitable from established rules. Bold premise commits fully, risks lyric fantasy without gimmickry; final reconfiguration heightens stakes.</comment>
