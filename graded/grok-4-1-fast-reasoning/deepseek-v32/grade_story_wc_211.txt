<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in archiving patterns intensifies compellingly to prophecy-driven action, with embodied dread ("chill tightened the velvet disquiet") and micro-choices like replaying the shaving revealing values. Interiority concrete and particular, noting "tremors in the speech." Final renunciation of passive archiving for active oath earns change with felt isolation/doubt cost. Contradictory impulses (warn vs. disbelief) surface but act mildly in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine immersion to prophecy realization tightening stake. Single scene oriented early ("ancient orchard garden atop the skyscraper"). Closure as CR: new oath reconfigures life's work with conceptual cost ("who would believe an oath scribe"), legible in final resolve to record hope. One meaningful deepening via setting-prophecy link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skyscraper orchard constrains realization ("silent tower bearing fruit") and charges final image of trees listening amid mist. Sensory hierarchy (velvet disquiet, misty air, unripe fruit) reflects Aris's attuned perception, mirroring internal states purposefully. Details tactile and selective, evolving with events (garden feels "sacred and haunted").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive patterns) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via prophecy to avert sea's drying—agency in immersions/replays narrows options. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise ending, cost felt in dread/urgency ("pulsed with urgent, personal significance"). One tightening forecloses passivity with doubt trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of accidental futures preserved in emotional patterns emerges organically from prophecy in mundane memory, reweighted by final oath amid ambiguity. Resonance in sea/oaths images without moralizing; invites reflection on persistence vs. fate. Protagonist arc inextricable, ending non-literal answer to archival purpose averting disaster.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (emotional spectra, sonic textures) biased to scribe's skills. Prose texture distinct: rhythmic syntax modulates from disquiet to purpose. No dialogue; purposeful compression in immersions legible under Accumulative lens. Diction fits lexicon, certain where Aris knows (dead languages).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but paraphrase loops ("velvet disquiet" motif purposeful yet over-relies; prophecy recaps in adjacent lines) dull minor beats (−0.4). Rhythms vary read-aloud, strong verbs/images propel. No filter stacks or template cadence in peaks; minor redundancy doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of wax shavings, Sumerian kids' chant, skyscraper orchard transforms prophecy trope organically. Premise fresh (oath scribe decoding emotions/fate); risks surreal setting/immersion heighten stakes coherently. Turns inevitable from particulars; singular vision persists.</comment>
