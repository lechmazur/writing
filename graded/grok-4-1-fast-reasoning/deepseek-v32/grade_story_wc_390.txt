<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the tuning scene: "hands steady but heart a drum, his logical mind calculating intervals while his emotions roared for haste," earning the protective rite with embodied cost under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: late cutter and approaching figures force adaptation to lighthouse rite, culminating in on-page Decisive Change where key glows sealed and figures retreat, with precision-risk cost legible in "error would amplify dissonance, cracking the ice further."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains choices (pier approach, ice risk) and charges final image where sound calms grinding plates into "pristine stillness," with sensory hierarchy via sonic focus (hum in molars).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect key escalates causally via figures' shouts narrowing tuning options; agency in bypassing corroded oscillator forces trade-off, with cost in potential ice/key shatter viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of vibrational harmony protecting the fragile emerges organically through rite, reweighted in final "profound peace" image without moralizing; resonance from sonic reveal of malicious intent via cleansing frequency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in sonic bias ("vibrated in his molars"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in "fingers danced, logically emotional," modulating to ethereal close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, but minor overwrite in stacked figures like "breath fogged materially while light died spectacularly" slightly muddles peak rhythm without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic absolution guarding sub-aquatic harmonies against ice chaos feels inevitable; risk in vibrational precision transforms lighthouse trope organically.</comment>
