<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Characterization strong in consistent resourcefulness and motivation to fight indifference, shown through micro-choices like memorizing the puddle map, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses or visible flaws complicating peak decisions; competence dominates without genuine struggle at the lagoon unlock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly from key → puddle map → tunnels → lagoon unlock → download DC; closure lands on-page with legible cost as booth sinks and Leo emerges reformed, "the drive secure in his pocket," foreclosing secrecy and charging future broadcast.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "puddles... reflections... sketched a map" and "auric lagoon... metallic, golden sheen" constrain choices (navigation, wading to pillar) and charge final image of booth sinking; sensory integration vivid and purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth vs. indifference) signaled early and tightens causally via map discovery narrowing path to lagoon; agency in key insertion yields reversal with cost (hours in tunnels, water parting), but minor abstractness in "tyranny of indifference" softens visceral peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth piercing apathy emerges organically from relic-to-revolution arc, culminating in resonant CR: "The key had not just unlocked a booth; it had unlocked a past, and with it, a future," reweighting unraveling plans without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (neon in puddles as map); rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively, e.g., short urgent sentences in tunnel travel, though occasional elevated diction borders register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops around "unraveling" motif ("plans were unraveling... unraveled threads") slightly dull mid-section without full pattern payoff; peak clarity intact at booth rise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of puddle-reflection map and auric lagoon repository transforms tropes into fresh causal engine; risk in poetic neon-map discovery heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight for Causal closure.</comment>
