<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's rationality and truthfulness drive the bargain and ritual choices consistently, but lack of on-page contradictory impulses or embodied stress in the storm ritual flattens interior conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through descriptive shards building to CR closure in fragile haven image; orientation anchors early; one tightening from personal acquisition to communal extension pays off with felt renewal cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hanging orchards and storms constrain ritual climb and charge final image of root-nets shaking, mirroring resilience; sensory details (wind scream, lightning) selectively heighten urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety tightens accumulatively via eye's imperfect occlusion and communal draw; ritual reversal narrows options with fragility cost legible in "fleeting, requiring constant renewal."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of managing fractures emerges organically from orchard resilience and eye's buffer; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of "patched-together moments."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third, perceptual bias toward rational beauty in storms; rhythmic modulation builds texture without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("fractured grace," repeated eye descriptors) and occasional elevated diction slightly dull peak ritual momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus world with glass-eye relic transforms post-apoc tropes via specific occlusion logic; risk in lyrical shards heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
