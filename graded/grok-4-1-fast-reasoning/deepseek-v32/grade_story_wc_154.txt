<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shrewd innocence concretely enables bridging past fears via decryption, with embodied ache ("lotus-hearted ache") layering contradiction; final endurance of wound with new inscription feels earned. Minor slip in epiphany phrasing ("persistent, quiet dialogue of care") borders unearned but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of decryption builds to CR closure ("old wound...now bore a new inscription"); orientation anchored early (atrium, anesthetic, photo); cost legible in final coral image as "map of interconnected healing" reconfiguring past siege.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atrium's mist/ferns/twilight mirrors internal "tranquil sea," constraining reflection via anesthetic haze; recurring coral/photo charge final image without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy reflects translator's perceptual bias toward patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unknot memories) signaled early, tightens via decryption beats under Accumulative lens, narrowing to reweighted hope; agency in parsing notes forecloses fear-only reading with felt ache-cost in "lotus...blooms...from the mud."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fear-to-connection emerges from cast/coral particulars, final image ("coral...map of interconnected healing") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting "shared anxieties"; no moralizing, ambiguity in persistent ache lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with translator's perceptual signature (dialects, decrypting metaphors); rhythmic modulation builds from haze to clarity, diction controlled and biased toward linguistic patterns without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors, but minor overwrite in opening ("slow tide...tranquil sea") risks muddle; no loops, rhythm varies, propulsion peaks at decryption ("piece by piece...coalesced"); closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cast-as-code decryption under anesthetic synthesizes translator's war past with healing in fresh, inevitable way; risk in lyric reflection pays off at coral/cast charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
