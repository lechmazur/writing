<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to amend past theft compels chivalrous swap with embodied resolve in "cautious abandon" climb; internal playful conflict acts in smile amid peril, earning wiser memento. Minor label-telling in "sacredly playful heart" slightly detaches from micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: sundial reveals door, swap merges secrets causing sky restoration (DC) and spire collapse; cost legible in "raced through melting corridors" escape. Orientation anchored early in spire climb/sky wrong; single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains climb/entry/escape; chamber chessboard charges swap image. Sensory cold/fog/thaw selective via Arin's priorities; violet sky evolution mirrors stakes without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swap to fix sky/amend) signaled early, tightens via collapse post-swap narrowing options to escape agency; cost felt in "leaped over crevices." Causal lens escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacred play/chivalry emerges implicitly via mentor echo, whisper "Only the playful can mend," and final smile-ready image reweighting theft to wonder. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases to "hidden magic"; rhythmic syntax modulates from poised climb to chaotic escape compression. No dialogue; voice texture consistent, purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("amend" x4, "embrace" x3, "pocket sundial lid" phrasing) create paraphrase churn dulling mid-section propulsion; rhythm varies but template echoes ("with open arms") trigger −0.6 artifact cap. Density high elsewhere, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief's chess-swap amends cosmic wrong via sundial, transforming tropes through honor/wonder logic; final memento inevitability risks bold fantasy without gimmick.</comment>
