<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely in "chest tightened with primal dread" and contradictory impulses (fear vs. prudent advance) act simultaneously; final change to "deeper courage" earned via sustained pressure without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from compass spin to organ chord triggering spatial mutiny; CR closure lands on-page in "true discovery requires the rebellion of perception" with conceptual cost of perceptual shift reweighting phobia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pulsing walls and "jagged teeth" pipes constrain phobia-driven choices and charge final "doorway in the air"; selective sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) reflects urgent perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (key vs. phobia) signaled early tightens via agency in pressing key, deepening to endurance with spiking phobia cost; under accumulative lens, reverberation density forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual rebellion emerges organically from organ sound mapping "hidden architecture"; final image "navigated mutiny... by getting lost" reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "void felt solid" and rhythmic modulation (short dread sentences to fluid awe); lyrical compression taught early pays off legibly at celestial expanse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motif echoes like repeated "wistful rebellion" and "spatial mutiny" pattern density purposefully but verge on paraphrase loops; propulsion strong in mutiny sequence with varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" via organ sound offers fresh synthesis of architecture/sound/phobia, transforming explorer trope; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
