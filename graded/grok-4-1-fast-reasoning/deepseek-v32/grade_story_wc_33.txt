<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra's interiority embodied via hammering heart against weary posture reveals contradictory impulses; micro-choice to tap signal earns final renunciation with felt void of Kael's absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: drone landing therefore inspection narrows to coded tap, sending real data via mailbag for on-page DC closure; legible cost in "weight of the void" and risked exposure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's flickering lights and brittle hush constrain drone ritual and inspection timing, charging final image where hush "tightened, ready to shatter" but holds as signal flies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggle data) tightens via Vynn spotting bulge, forcing Ezra's agency in signal tap; cost unmistakable as he hands decoy, foreclosing overt rebellion path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises emerges via linking absences to covert signal; final "something began, quietly, to heal" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (linking absences) biases details; Vynn's dialogue carries subtext of suspended codes, distinct from Ezra's internal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "tapped a rapid, coded sequence" varies rhythm under pressure; no loops, purposeful metaphors like "thunderstorm in a bottle" integrate without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postal rules as smuggling shield transforms mailman trope; thunderstorm vial's decoy twist inevitable from "respectfully rebellious" setup, risking bold inversion.</comment>
