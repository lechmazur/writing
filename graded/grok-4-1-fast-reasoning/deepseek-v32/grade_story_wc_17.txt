<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through discoveries to compel deactivation; interiority embodied (heart pounding, fingers brush strip) but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal moments like panel search.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with discovery density tightening to Charged Poise closure (device deactivated, burden persists in heart as felt cost); orientation anchored early, one deepening via negative-to-blueprint linkage suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage with damp stone, drip echoes, and overgrown panel constrains searches and charges final "sigh" release; sensory hierarchy favors sonic perception, mirroring internal burden evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover wall dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through negative's blueprint revelation narrowing to deactivation agency; visible cost (carried burden) charges ending under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Legacy's burden emerges from joy/horror echoes without overt statement until "glimpsed the truth" line risks mild moralizing; resonant final image of carrying artifacts reweights memory as responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with sonic-biased perceptual signature ("whispers of old places"); rhythmic lyricism modulates but elevated diction occasionally drifts from cartographer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence variety and density propel but repetitive stems ("I [found/action]ed") and paraphrase loops (passage as "tomb of memories" echoing prior ivy/depth) create mild template cadence across discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh "corridor echo cartographer" premise transforms post-climate tropes via sonic mapping to deactivation; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
