<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's obsession with deleted files drives consistent micro-choices like tracing numbers and lying to Kael, with embodied contradiction in her "neutral expression" masking a "mind screaming." Internal conflict layers as curiosity clashes with self-preservation, earning the closure renunciation. Minor summary in backstory slightly dilutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of numbers/discoveries builds density to CR closure in Aris's lie and personal cache, reweighting premise with "physical weight in her chest" as legible cost. Orientation anchored early in archive; one tightening via confrontation suffices. No lens ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive as "digital necropolis" and "cold corridors" constrain digging; "echo of forgotten songs" recurs to mirror internal void, charging final image. Sensory filter (humming void) reflects Aris's priorities without tourist catalog. Patch subtly guides thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs suppression) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through encrypted diary to Kael confrontation, forcing lie with on-page cost ("sensed absence now a physical weight"). Agency in unofficial tools and deception narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges organically via poem/patch to final cache: "deleted files... went into the keepers who chose to remember," reweighting premise without statement. Closing image resonates as non-literal answer to "where deleted files go." Complexity lingers in moral ambiguity of lie.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in digital metaphors ("frozen river," "digital tomb"); voice modulates rhythmically, compressing at confrontation. Dialogue sparse but subtextual: Kael's "some memories are best left formatted" vs. Aris's steady lie advances stakes. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; metaphors like "silent ghost in the machine" integrate without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in discoveries ("numbers... etched... pulsed") subtract slightly, but no closure touch or filter stacks. Propulsion clear in final "brightly attentive silence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voyager twist transforms mission trope into archive conspiracy with fresh digital necropolis frame; patch synthesis feels inevitable. Risk in quiet CR closure heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
