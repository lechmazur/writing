<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to harmonize discord is rooted in consistent traits and shown through micro-choices like offering the feather; interiority concrete in perceiving fragments as threads. Boy as secondary applies relational pressure, forcing soothing action. Minor flaw: reflective summaries slightly dilute embodied contradiction in peak interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/textural density builds from solitary finds to kite snap interaction, tightening to Charged Poise closure in feather-bookmark image with felt cost of loss tuned to wonder. Orientation anchored early (lagoon, poet post-rain). No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "fragments settle... quiet song."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details vivid/selective (wet stone/salt, shattered cobalt glass), filtered through poet's priorities; lagoon constrains discoveries (feather half-buried). Feather as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring internal harmony. Spatial choreography clear along shore.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via kite snap discord forcing feather-gift agency; boy's dismay adds pressure, narrowing to wonder with visible cost in softened disappointment. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient; low-key but legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing discord emerges organically from feather/kite events, reweighted in final notebook image without statement; subtext in boy's "little sky" and return gesture offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity in loss-as-beauty lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (polishing memories like stones) stable in third-limited POV; dialogue natural/subtextual (boy's simple wonder vs. Elias's gentle explanation), distinct idiom. Rhythm modulates with intensity, diction poet-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; purposeful figurative coherence (shattered glass, woven dawns). Minor deductions for paraphrase loops ("harmonizing discord" x3, "incomplete" recurrences) and synonym churn in reflections, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric poet finding drake feather amid kite loss transforms loss-into-beauty trope via specific imagery/world logic; risk in fantasy-natural blend heightens stakes organically. Closing notebook reprise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
