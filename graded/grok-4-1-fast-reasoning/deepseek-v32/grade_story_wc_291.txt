<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness and methodical traits drive specific choices like visualizing from descriptions and unifying opposites for insight; internal conflict between logic and empathy builds credibly. Epiphany at locket feels slightly told ("surge of empathy... awaken painfully") rather than fully embodied, but prior causality earns the change with painful cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens: evidence disappearance therefore quarry visit therefore opposites insight therefore box discovery leading to CR closure (empathy reconfiguration) with legible emotional cost in "painfully" awakened feeling. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via insight suffices for scope; no shards exceed defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quarry's mist, cliffs, crevice concretely constrain climb and enable box find, charging final mist-lift image; sensory details (damp smell, gravel crunch) filtered through methodical POV bias. Specificity integrates into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crack case, awaken empathy) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven insight narrowing options to climb; cost felt in painful empathy surge and foreclosed detachment. Escalation coherent under causal lens without need for multiples.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites (logic/feeling, elegance/violence) emerges organically from ribbon, quarry, method to resonant CR end ("see with the heart"); final portrait image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with face-blind perceptual signature (faces as "shifting mosaics"); literary diction/rhythm modulates from methodical catalog to intuitive surge without drift. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in stacked metaphors ("lance the suffocating mystery," "lanced the boil," "furrowed hush") muddles peak insight beat with figurative density; minor paraphrase loops ("methodical" x3, opposites reprise). Propulsion strong otherwise, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's paradoxical method for cold case transforms tropes organically; quarry opposites synthesis feels inevitable, risking quiet CR closure over confrontation.</comment>
