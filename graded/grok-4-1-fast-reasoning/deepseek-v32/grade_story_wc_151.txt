<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to find meaning in margins shown through ritual but told repetitively without contradictory impulses acting in scene; micro-choices like chalk drawing reveal traits, yet no flawed decision under pressure forecloses a path with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building ritual to charged poise at handoff; closure reconfiguration legible as preparation yields to dispatch with fading codes as felt cost in "would fade with the day's foot traffic or the first rain."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Golden arcade at dawn constrains ephemerality of codes via foot traffic/light and charges final image of brightening dawn chasing shadows; sensory details filtered through Elara's nostalgic bias integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Secrecy stake signaled early builds texturally through ritual steps but lacks agency-driven tightening narrowing options; handoff crystallizes pressure coherently under accumulative lens with ephemeral cost felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia emerges organically from analog ritual vs. digital threats, resonating in final dispatch image reweighting virtual dominance without moralizing; chalk motifs shift meaning through secrecy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of inventive analog poetics; rhythmic modulation supports ritual build, diction consistent with Elara's lexicon despite minimal dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on motivation ("discover meaning in the margins" x2) and "juxtaposed" repeats create synonym churn dulling mid-density; rhythmic variety present but artifacts pervade without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Chalk codes as childish cipher transforms surveillance evasion trope through grounded futuristic nostalgia; organic synthesis of analog secrecy feels fresh and inevitable in ritual closure.</comment>
