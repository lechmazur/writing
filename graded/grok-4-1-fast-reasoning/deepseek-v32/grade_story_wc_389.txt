<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "hands steady despite the tower's shudder" reveals contradictory solitude sharpening her hearing; final broadcast earns change from variant impulses without safety-hedging. Minor abstraction in "variant allegiance" slightly dilutes pivotal micro-choice specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from sharpening signals to deliberate interference; Charged Poise closure lands on-page at broadcast with exhaustion as felt cost, "console glowed as she sent the packet." Orientation anchored early in observatory amid storm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico constrains as signal amplifier ("hummed, amplifying a weak signal") and charges final image ("dawn touched the cobalt glass, setting it ablaze"); stormlit setting tactilely pressures choices amid thunder and wind. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered through radio urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to temper prophet via broadcast tightens accumulatively at priority signal override forcing counter-transmission; agency in "fingers flew, keying in the sequence" forecloses blind allegiance with visible exhaustion cost. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth-in-static mercy emerges organically from signal-weaving actions; final image of "airwaves settled into a new, more complex pattern" offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Particulars like lullaby equations avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature in signal-as-verse noticing; rhythmic modulation fits emotional peaks like storm's "violent daylight." Purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but paraphrase loops on "ancient shadows" and "unfold" (three+ instances) create mild churn dulling propulsion; template cadence in prophecy descriptions ("verses emerged—lyrically prophetic fragments") triggers −0.6. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-prophecy visionary transforming messiah trope via orbital lullaby broadcast; risk-taking in gritty-whimsy lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from portico's signal-focusing lens.</comment>
