<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via buckle as anchor from past fall, compelling revision under pressure; interiority concrete through muscle memory actions. Minor epiphanic tidy-up at "he understood the watcher's burden not as a curse, but as a call to action" slightly smooths contradiction, but earned by prior causality without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from static-clear to data corruption tightening stake; single scene anchored early ("Aris stood in the nocturnal arbor"). Closure as Charged Poise in "He finalized the revisions and sent the alert" reconfigures burden with felt ongoing cost in final buckle image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (star-flecked void, radio static, glass-domed corridors) filtered through pattern seeker's bias; arbor constrains via damaged circuits bypassed on-page. Buckle as recurring micro-setting charges closure image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert debris via revision) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via corruption forcing inventive bypass; agency in "reconfigured the communication array" narrows options. Cost legible in "pressure immense and unyielding" charging final resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of burden-to-purpose emerges organically from buckle evolution and revision struggle, without statement; final "weight and the worth" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting watcher premise. Subtext in soundless echoes layers complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (pattern anomalies, muscle memory feel); voice texture rhythmic and biased toward celestial/technical idiom. Patterned repetition ("radio static cleared") taught early as motif, legible under lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but paraphrase loops ("muscle memory" x4, "radio static cleared" x3, "soundless echo" x3) create template cadence, dulling propulsion in work beats. Minor synonym churn around "burden" and "pressure"; rhythm varies but artifacts touch mid-escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi duty trope via arbor isolation and buckle's failure-to-purpose arc; poetic voice transforms pattern-seeking into textured vigilance. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight closure.</comment>
