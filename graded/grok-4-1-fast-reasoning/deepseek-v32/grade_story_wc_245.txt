<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied motivation shines in "quiet blaze of hope that burned behind his ribs," driving micro-choices like tracing notes; grief as contradictory impulse layers with forward drive, earning final endurance without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to silence; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "the Stillpoint was not a place on any map, but a condition of the soul," with emotional cost legible in settled grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "frantic needle-pricks" and "velvet across his palms" filter through tactile POV, constraining choices; bark chord charges final climb and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reaching Stillpoint tightens via note trail discovery, narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in absorption/climb shows felt cost in fading "crushing ultrasonic texture."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inner mapping emerges organically from particulars, resonant in final "charted the territory of his own heart" without moralizing; reweights sensory journey non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable tactile perceptual signature ("cool, smooth sphere for a C") biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like note shapes; no loops, propulsion peaks in climb where syntax breathes with absorption; zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness-as-superpower and tactile music transforms sensory tropes; risk in skin-absorption logic heightens stakes inevitably to soul-map climax.</comment>
