<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate confusion into clarity compels all key choices, rooted in adaptable, warmly methodical traits shown through precise actions; interiority concrete and particular, with micro-choices revealing values under puzzle pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via ritual actions to CR closure ("fables of absence were not about loss, but about necessary hidden connections"); cost legible in reweighted history and "fleeting, impossible door" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mechanism room's gears, pendulums, and brass chest constrain choices (rope location, door shimmer) and charge final image ("room settled around her, a silent guardian"); sensory details (silence, glow) filtered through archivist priorities integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge anomalies) signaled early tightens via braid reconfiguration narrowing options to door; agency in merging drives escalation under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in resolved yet hidden truths charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden connections emerges organically from merging fables into coherent history; final CR image ("truth hidden within its gears") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting absence to presence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of precise archival noticing; rhythmic syntax modulates with ritual intensity, diction controlled and methodical without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in action beats, but minor paraphrase loops ("confusion...clarity"; repeated "warmly methodical") and redundant endings ("resolved mystery"; "work here was done") drag momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival ritual and temporal hinge transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in braid-merging premise heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
