<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear but told via summaries like "Arin's motivation solidified" without contradictory impulses acting in the fossil-handling beat; lacks embodied flaws or micro-choices under pressure, rendering Arin competent but generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern build from heat-map to fossil activation to visions, landing CR closure in map completion and lingering float with felt unity cost; one tightening at fossil glow suffices, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "drip of water" and salt air integrate into action; fossil as recurring object charges final image and constrains interpretation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to voice the unknown deepens accumulatively via fossil interaction narrowing to conduit realization; agency in documenting/placing fossil shows trade-off, cost legible in solidified purpose amid silent caves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of past-present unity emerges organically from fossil memories and map web, resonant in final emergence reweighting hibernation loss; avoids moralizing though "factually mystical" edges direct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of sensory mapping; rhythmic texture modulates but uniform sentence openings flatten peaks; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops like multiple "transitional objects" and "factually mystical" create paraphrase churn across beats; template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., "Arin [action]") dulls density without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional heat-mapping and post-hibernation fossils transforms sci-fi tropes via lived sensory cartography; fossil reprise feels inevitable to closure.</comment>
