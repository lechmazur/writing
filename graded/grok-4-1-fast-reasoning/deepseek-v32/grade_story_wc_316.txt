<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's numbness as contradictory impulse (phantom chest tightening at lawyer's scorn) compels protective choice at pedestal, earning faint warmth with visible cost of channeling void. Interiority concrete via neural patterns echoing without emotion. Final hand-on-glass act forecloses numbness path holistically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: backstory→lawyers→spark→vivification DC with "Brother" thought and custody grant reconfiguring options. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (dojo, sky, Kael). Cost legible in "offering the quiet space where emotion could finally live."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating dojo and rewriting sky constrain hearing amid empires rising/falling, pausing at climax to charge custody image. Jar's cool glass anchors body/attention in pivotal touch. Sensory hierarchy numb-filtered (flat voice vs. pulsing amber).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify clone to defeat numbness) tightens via lawyer's claim narrowing to protective will, forcing agency in complementary channeling. Cost felt in void-as-vessel trade-off, altering tactics to internal rhythm pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotion via opposites emerges implicitly: rage/stillness countered in void offering warmth opposite cold. Final "faintest warmth" reweights numbness premise non-literally via brain's "Brother."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with numb perceptual signature (history "rewrite itself" detached). Dialogue natural/subtextual (Liren's "grinding stone" vs. lawyers' "cold legality"). Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at hand-on-glass.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short punchy hearing beats vs. breathing reflection). No loops; metaphors purposeful ("blade of clarity slices pretense"). Propulsion peaks clean at pulsing filaments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego-death clone-jar custody in rewriting-history dojo transforms tropes organically. Risky complementary-opposites method heightens stakes, inevitable in "Brother" payoff.</comment>
