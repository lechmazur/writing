<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of hope and sorrow embodied in trembling heart and buckling knees compel assembly; final awe/grief earned via flawed bird's emergence, foreclosing pure beauty with poignant cost. Interiority particular (echo of lost song), actions reveal obsession without epiphanies. No safety-hedging in flawed quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hypothesizing/assemble/activate builds density to CR closure in bird's modulating song reweighting beauty, with legible cost in "bitterly sweet truth washing over him." Single scene anchored early (Prince in stalactite palace); no orientation debt. Persistent egg constraint shapes tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stalactite palace's quaking chains mirror/pressure heart, constrain deliberate assembly; brass feathers' prismatic scatter charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (groans, hum, chirp) filtered via obsession. Evolving details (glow, crack) integrate with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) signaled early, tightens via hatching reversal narrowing to imperfect echo; agency in key-turn/activation forecloses pure genesis with felt despair-to-awe cost. Pressure coheres accumulatively to charged poise in suspended reverie. One deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Flawed genesis theme emerges via mechanical bird's "broken song" reweighting mechanical world, resonant CR without moralizing; ambiguity in "fragile kind of beauty" lingers. Particulars (brass feathers, tinkling melody) drive irony over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (beauty obsession colors noticing); rhythmic prose modulates from hum to chirp-to-melody. Diction purposeful (grinding gears vs. wind/tree memory). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "hair-thin strand of silver" advances assembly); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful (grey pearl, spider's thread), no overwriting in peak hatching. Clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk resurrection yields inevitable CR (fossil to mechanical bird's haunting beauty); transforms Frankenstein trope via prismatic feathers' purity strain. Bold risk in Accumulative lens pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
