<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's synesthetic interiority and embodied tension ("heart hammered against her ribs in counterpoint to the bells") reveal consistent motivation rooted in lineage duty, earning the fulfillment at closure; contradictory impulses between frantic action and meditative calm act simultaneously without alternating summaries. Minor flaw: idealized competence lacks deeper blind spots complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-building bell tones and aurora pulses converging on the hush's release (DC) as on-page closure, with felt cost in the faded amber sheet and Elara's frozen tears; orientation anchors immediately in ice cavern role. Single scene causality traces precisely to synchronized chisel strike without unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice cavern's walls reflecting aurora constrain timing and enable wonder's escape through fissures, charging the final glowing internal luminescence image; sensory hierarchy via synesthesia filters purposefully (bell tones as "silver tendrils"). Micro-setting (bells, hush core) integrates tactilely into actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder via precise alignment) signaled early escalates accumulatively through intensifying aurora and bell layers narrowing timing options, with agency in progressive ringing forcing trade-off (heart's counterpoint pressure); cost unmistakable in duty's fulfillment and sheet's fade reweighting her role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's essentiality emerges organically from hush release weaving into ice, offering resonant non-literal answer in world's reminder of magic without moralizing; final image (cavern as "cradle of active peace") recharges prior lineage guard duty. Subtext in oscillating repose tensions pragmatic dullness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("notes as deep indigo waves") biases noticing distinctively, with rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences at climax: "The sculpted hush shattered..."); stable close third-person POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "ultramarine that struck the hush" advances action/atmosphere/synesthesia); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrite: stacked figures in peak ("rainbow tsunami") slightly muddle but voice-motivated by synesthesia.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, hush containment, and sculptor sync transforms mythic guardian trope into precise harmonic ritual; risk-taking in accumulative color/sound layering heightens closure stakes inevitably. Non-obvious chisel alignment inflects wonder's certification organically.</comment>
