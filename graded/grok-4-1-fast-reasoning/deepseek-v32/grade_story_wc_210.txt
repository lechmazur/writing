<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai's rejection of false comfort roots consistent traits in embodied mental discipline during bottle resonance, compelling higher-stakes endurance in daily mappings. Interiority shines in "fleeting, practical fragments" like calluses and tides, revealing character through micro-choices. Minor summary of "walked the cove for days" slightly abstracts conflict, but final sharing of principles earns change without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory fragments accumulate density into preparations, tightening to boat arrival as pattern break with legible cost of "arduous mental presence." Orientation anchors instantly in pier/empty town. Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "palpable integrity of the work" reconfiguring solitude to community, cost felt in rejected spring's passivity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of salt and rot" and "rustle of dry seaweed" filter through Kai's priorities, constraining choices via recalled clay pit and blackberries. Recurring pier evolves from silence to lantern signal, charging final boat image. Professional alchemist lens shapes selective attention to "water flows" for irrigation without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagine civilization vs. hollow comfort—tightens accumulatively through memory-guided actions narrowing passive revival option. Agency in clearing channels and planting shows trade-offs, with boat as deepening that forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in "constant mental presence," charging arrivals without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truthful growth vs. false comfort emerges organically from bottle memories contrasting spring's "trivial" wishes, resonating in final "conscious, conceived successor." Subtext in small details like "social logic of shared heat" invites ambiguity without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable, final image reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in memory "ripples" and "fleeting fragments," modulating rhythm under focus. Prose texture distinct in syntax reflecting alchemist mind. End dialogue natural/subtextual—"Place the commons where paths cross"—distinguishes voices without on-page overlap issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines like "callus on a woman's hand... quick calculation of tide angles" advance multiple layers without padding. Varied rhythm supports accumulative build; minor "memory" recurrence purposeful, not looped. Slight paraphrase in revival descriptions ("not a resurrection, but a reconciliation") near mid but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of working memory as civilization tool transforms ghost town trope via bottle's "raw, moment-to-moment thoughts." Risk in arduous, non-magical revival heightens stakes organically. Final lantern-to-community arc feels inevitable from memory impulses, no derivative templates.</comment>
