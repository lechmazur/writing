<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority through sculptor's perceptual lens, with carving as earned micro-choice revealing hierarchy of values; motivation roots in "scaffold complexity with simplicity," compelling reversal. Minor slip in idealized "profound understanding" epiphany without deeper embodied contradiction at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via perception density building to CR closure: "wave of profound understanding" reweights navigation premise with conceptual cost of obsolete GPS, etched map as undeniable price in final image. Orientation anchored early; single scene causality intact through slide study to carving payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Archway setting constrains pivotal carving into "natural socket," charging closure; turbine-hum and storm sensory hierarchy reflect sculptor's priorities, evolving from obstacle to power source. Micro-setting via driftwood and slide integrates tactile lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reactivate beacon) signaled early, deepens via slide glow and beings' appearance, forcing interpretive carving agency that narrows options under accumulative lens. Cost legible in "hands still humming" and teaching burden charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of alliances via art emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR in "star-path" reweighting premise without moralizing; returning lattice image shifts from phantom to radiant sky. Complexity embraced in perception over physics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (sculptor seeing "intentional channels"); rhythmic modulation builds reverie to chord swell, diction controlled and biased. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm without loops; minor overwriting in "dusk bled into a darker night" but purposeful for tone. No artifacts dulling closure image of humming hands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of driftwood art activating time-beacon transforms tropes organically; risk in symbolic circuit via carving heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from slide key.</comment>
