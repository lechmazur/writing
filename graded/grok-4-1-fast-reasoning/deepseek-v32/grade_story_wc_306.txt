<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aris's sincerely insincere detachment and Lena's rigid-to-nuanced shift feel earned through process, with micro-choices like peering into the shard revealing values; internal conflict surfaces in her chill and hesitation but leans toward summary labels like "protected vulnerability." Strong embodiment in her smile at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: chimes-to-shard-to-breath sequence deepens turmoil to release; on-page Charged Poise closure via Lena's genuine smile and shard-keeping, with cost of abandoned certainty legible in "doubt is not emptiness, but space for growth." Orientation anchored early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse with chimes and dawn light constrains via discordant tones mirroring doubts, charging final high note; sensory wind guides choices purposefully without catalog. Final shadows and dancing chimes evolve to mirror transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. nuance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through interpretive beats narrowing to embrace paradox; agency in her peering/breathing forecloses rigidity with felt void-chill cost charging smile at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of doubt-as-growth emerges via shard-void and chime-release without moralizing; final image of smiling departure with shard reweights rigidity-to-nuance non-literally. Minor directness in explanations like "cloak of doubt" tempered by enactment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited via Aris's perceptual signature (e.g., "decipher one final selection"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Look into this, but not for your reflection"), with rhythmic modulation under interpretive pressure. Clean free indirect without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chimes link sensory/action/theme); minor paraphrase loops like repeated "deciphering wind chime selections" dull momentum slightly, but rhythm varies and closure image propels cleanly. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "conscience for hire" via shard/chimes transforms therapy trope into textured ritual; risk in metaphorical layering (unhook/cloak) heightens nuance stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at release-note closure.</comment>
