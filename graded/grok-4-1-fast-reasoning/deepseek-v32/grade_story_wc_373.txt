<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's steadfast curiosity drives consistent choices, embodied in her ears straining and recorder use, with internal conflict via tied fate to fob as collateral. Meaningful endurance shown in persisting through layers of trust. Minor flaw: curiosity feels slightly label-driven without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence density builds via false starts to CR closure in captured sigh and hush realization, with fob return as felt cost ("its steadfast weight a comfort"). Orientation anchored early (pier, market). Single scene coherent, one tightening at high-stakes deal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pier planks, nets, lantern light constrain hiding/recording choices; barnacles layer trust metaphorically. Sensory hush (whispers, boots echoing) filters via Elara's ear-strain urgency, charging final damp sand walk. Object-as-setting fob handled tactilely across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sound for debt) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through failed attempts to sigh capture, narrowing via hush pressure. Agency in approaching Ticker/Mistress; cost legible in fob collateral during captain's demand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragile hush emerges organically via sigh as trust break, reweighted in final "some silences are bought and some are earned." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in lingering unease without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias to sounds (e.g., "felt in her teeth"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("everything has its breaking point"). Rhythmic texture modulates tension, diction coastal-poetic apt for Elara.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short tension sentences ("That was it"); density high, no major loops though "false starts" recurs purposefully. Minor overwriting in "tension was a living thing, a thick silence" but supports accumulative hush build without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh premise transforms pirate trope via acoustic quest in silent market; sigh as trust break ingenious, grown from hush particulars. Fob evolves organically from charm to token of understanding.</comment>
