<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal mapping and pigeon release earned by prior data correlation and lateral intuition; contradictory solitude vs action impulses act simultaneously in final return to rain gauge with visible cost to prior calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as message density builds to data-mapping tightening, landing Charged Poise closure at pigeon's release; "purposeful tension" image makes cost legible without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard tools (rain gauge, weather station logs) constrain mapping choice; final return to gauge amid ivy-shadows charges closure image under dusk-to-night evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Message deepens dominant truth-pursuit stake via agency-driven correlation, narrowing to lateral send; cost to solitude unmistakable in "interwoven... purposeful tension."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lateral truth-nurturing emerges implicitly from mapping-to-pigeon chain; final rain gauge image resonantly reweights solitary integrity without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meteorological perceptual signature ("datum a stitch," "low-pressure systems anchoring") biases noticing consistently; syntax rhythm modulates from observant calm to charged release without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete images; minor figurative density ("geographical wound") in mapping beat purposeful, not obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pigeon-mediated lateral truth-chain transforms meteorological conspiracy premise organically; courtyard-to-colleague hopscotch feels inevitable from established recording habits.</comment>
