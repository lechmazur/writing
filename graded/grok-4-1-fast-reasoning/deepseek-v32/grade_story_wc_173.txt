<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation sharp and consistent, rooted in "chaste courtesan" discipline clashing with "language felt like a cage"; embodied release via fingers "patient and cool" in untangling. Internal conflict embodied in suppressed echoes harvested through micro-choices. Final declaration earned, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under peak pressure, slightly capping below 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from untangling to canopy via threaded echoes, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure in "soft, glowing dust" settling with permanent "silver sheen." One tightening via descent to courtyard narrows to raw dance. Orientation anchored early ("silver courtyard," "forgotten turret"); cost legible in etched defiance and Lord's seeded echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary dome fractures "moonbeams into spectral rivers," constraining untangling and charging threads' rise; courtyard snow pressures serene defiance, mirroring internal thaw. Sensory hierarchy poetic yet selective (soundless snow vs. humming canopy). Final sheen recharges setting, constraining conformity's aftermath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy "lullaby of conformity") signaled early, tightens texturally in threads' animation to canopy. Agency in untangling/dance forecloses restrained life with felt cost in dissolution. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, but Lord's distant witness adds no direct pressure test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unsung body's voice emerges via harvested echoes weaving "resonant canopy," reweighting restraint as revelation without moralizing. Final "whisper of threads untangled" offers non-literal answer, charging prior particulars. Organic from conflict, with ambiguity in Lord's echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in fractured light/sound bias. Prose texture modulates rhythmically from patient untangling to seismic dance. No head-hopping; elision of backstory patterned and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short tremor sentences to flowing arcs); density high, metaphors coherent (threads as "liquid mercury," sound-reflectors). Minor figurative density in peak dance risks overwrite but pattern-taught early. No loops; propulsion clear to dust fall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bodily restraint into audible threads/canopy transforms courtesan trope via echo-harvest defiance. Risky lyric conceit inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes through "alarming serenity." Closure image uniquely charges premise.</comment>
