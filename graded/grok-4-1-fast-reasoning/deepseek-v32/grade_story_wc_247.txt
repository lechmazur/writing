<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music compels all micro-choices, earning Leo's perceptual shift with her isolation as felt cost; internal joyful sorrow embodied through persistent task. Leo's haunted turmoil yields credible endurance under her guidance. Voice distinct in signs versus his silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Elara's solo mapping to shared perception, culminating in CR where Leo remembers her amid oblivion—"he remembered"—with conceptual cost of her isolation undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Luminous harbor moonlight anchors early, with lanterns/pier hollows constraining mapping choices; cool air, water light evolve tactilely, charging final moon-path click as resonant mirror to silence's fullness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating Leo's noise into silence-music—tightens accumulatively when he peers through camera, forcing sensory reconfiguration; cost legible in his swelling joyful sorrow against her loneliness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-symphony emerges organically from mapping beats, reweighted in Leo's realization without statement; final harbor gleam offers non-literal answer, lingering ambiguity of her timeframe's isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature biases toward visual stillness-as-music; sign "language" dialogue natural, subtextual, goal-driven. Rhythmic poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel lyric accumulation; purposeful motif recurrence ("mapping silence") avoids loops but borders template cadence in "joyful sorrow" repeats, slightly dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sign-language silence-mapping with empty camera transforms oblivion trope into fresh perceptual symphony; risk of abstract conceit heightens stakes via Leo's concrete sensory turn, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
