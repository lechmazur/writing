<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation roots deeply in "geography of healing," embodied via thread's weight and echoed loneliness; final endurance of shared silence earns change without epiphany overreach. Minor slip in "He understood then" borders stock revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "his own loneliness echoing hers" and star-mapping image reconfiguring healing as landmarks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's "rust and gold" and "sweet, poignant rot" constrain via mirroring decay, charging final "monument" image; micro-setting thread handled tactilely shapes perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping life/healing) tightens texturally as voice fades to death; agency in presence forecloses isolation path, cost felt in "persistent, textured reality."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "undercurrents that bound the...carpet" emerges via thread/garden particulars; final image reweights absence as "landmark" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Aris-limited POV with perceptual bias (decay as splendor); dialogue subtextual ("Do you think it will be enough?") advances via implication, rhythmic control peaks in silence beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory/motif without loops; figurative "burned like embers" purposeful for tone, but minor density strain in opening garden para touches propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh "obituaries for the living" premise transformed via thread/healing map; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
