<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Aris's involuntary truthfulness constrains speech and compels the reveal commitment at "I cannot stay silent," earning change with cost; motivation to preserve wonder drives fix before truth, shown in pause before opening box.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: matchbox riddle therefore lacquer box therefore docs therefore manual discharge restores power; on-page DC closure in "Blue energy arced... hum returning," with outrage cost legible in final booth scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower spires, archive shelves, control panels constrain descent and discharge choice; "nectar-dusk sky" and "drone beehives... threatening the ecosystem" filter through Aris's priorities, charging final blooming city image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/wonder restoration) signaled early, tightens via sabotage reveal narrowing to fix-or-reveal choice; agency in "initiated a manual discharge sequence" forecloses blackout path with ecosystem cost felt in hum's return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth enabling wonder emerges via box reveal to fix, resonating in "routine without truth is empty" and final booth sharing; minor slip in articulated moralizing at "preserving wonder meant embracing truth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV to Aris with perceptual bias on "crackle of captured lightning"; dialogue natural/subtextual, e.g., stranger's "That's why I came to you" advances alliance without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy discharge beat ("fingers dancing over outdated panels"); minor paraphrase loops in "truth" repetitions and "nectar dusk" overuse dull density slightly, but no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lightning-tower bees and SynthHoney sabotage transforms eco-blackout trope; risk in truthful protagonist's unhedged candor heightens reveal stakes organically.</comment>
