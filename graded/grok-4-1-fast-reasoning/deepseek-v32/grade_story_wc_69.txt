<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Alistair's expectantly resigned demeanor and motivation to braid voices feel consistent, but choir transformation relies on summary ("soprano...now shared smiles") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is mild and not contradictory in scene. Final gifting earned via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rehearsals build density to Charged Poise closure in performance/gifting with fragile harmony cost legible ("harmony...fragile, like the vanishing arts"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening from distrust to public success. Summary across weeks fits lens without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn details selective/sensory (amber light, falling leaves, book scent); rosette as micro-setting charges final image/gifting. Setting as sanctuary subtly guides rehearsal choices. No white-room; evolves to empty echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlearning hatred via harmony) signaled early; escalation via lens-deepening from wary singles/chords to seamless public braid forecloses distrust path with fragile cost. Agency in Alistair's subtracting method; no coincidences resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony from subtracting noise/prejudice emerges via particulars (rosette patterns, folk tune blending); final image reconfigures premise non-literally without moralizing. No Thematic Echo despite repetitions; resonance from choir shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Alistair with perceptual bias (weary hope); poetic texture distinct in syntax/rhythm ("traveled stillness"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Let this remind us"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("subtracting noise," "braid," "vanishing arts," "denote") across summary beats create mild template cadence, dulling propulsion. Purposeful motifs mitigate but touch closure ("denote our commitment"). Sensory integration strong; rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: choir unlearning hatred via zither rosette symbol transforms unity trope through subtracting noise method. No template plot; risk in fragile harmony premise feels organic. Final echo image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
