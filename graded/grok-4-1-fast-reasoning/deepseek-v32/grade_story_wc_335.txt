<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's combative tenderness and backward walk embody motivation during tea lesson ("voice sharp yet kind"); Kael's skepticism to breakthrough earned via persistent annotation, with relational crucible forcing reclamation without bitterness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from tea spirals to playground shadow linkage ("The geometry here... mirrors the playground shadow"); CR closure lands on-page with cost in "reclaim that memory without bitterness," one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Forgotten library and playground swing anchor early, evolve causally (drifts to still, symbolizing transformation); swing charges final image as "symbol of past loneliness now transformed," constraining Elian's watchful peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse exile) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Kael's breakthrough pointing to tea leaves; agency in annotation forecloses bitterness path with felt cost at declaration ("I am not exiled anymore").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via past-understanding emerges organically from shard annotations and ledger handoff; final image of still swing and fresh tea offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting exile cycle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalization with perceptual bias toward geometric patterns; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("See this spiral"), natural under pressure; rhythmic texture consistent despite minor elevated diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops in finale ("reversible exile... reversed," "annotate... annotated," "combative tenderness") dull closure image with synonym churn (−1.1); density strong earlier but artifacts accumulate in summary ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shard-mirrors and tea geometry synthesize fresh premise organically; risk in magical-realist annotation transforms exile trope, inevitable hindsight from early method to ledger legacy.</comment>
