<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's warmly observant nature drives micro-choices like tracing the cicada, earning the relational shift; Kael's softening from anger to "I see" feels motivated by her guidance. Internal conflict subtle but embodied in tangential focus amid painful silence. Minor slip: epiphanic smoothness lacks deeper contradiction at peak handover.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from cicada to pool ripples to starlit realization; closure as Charged Poise in Kael's "low tide" nod reconfigures parting with relational cost felt in shared silence. Orientation anchored early in grotto setup. One tightening via object handover suffices; lens holds cleanly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's drips, star-reflecting pool, and stalactites constrain tangential observation and charge final image of cicada between them. Sensory details (cool jade, expanding rings) filter through Elara's tidal bias, mirroring internal flux. Evolves causally with conversational pause; micro-setting as "setting" excels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (parting conversation) signaled in opening silence; textural escalation via pattern-deepening (cicada → pool → time texture) forces stance crystallization. Agency in Elara's handover narrows options from fracture to evolution; cost legible in "not breaking" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transitions as fertile emerges organically from cicada dormancy, tidal flux, and low-tide metaphor; final image reweights premise without statement. Subtext in silence and handover carries relational ambiguity. Resonant non-literal answer in shared grotto embrace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in textured metaphors (slippery algae, gritty sand); voice modulates from observant to soft dialogue. Natural subtext in Elara's "Time isn't a river"; rhythmic control heightens pause. No head-hopping; lyric compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; rhythm varies in drip/pool imagery. Minor paraphrase loops on "transition periods" and tidal analogies (−0.4), but no closure touch. Clean syntax, no artifacts dulling final charged poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler using cicada for temporal insight transforms breakup trope into textural evolution. Risky lyric accumulative design heightens stakes via nature crucible. Inevitable in hindsight from early patterns; no derivatives.</comment>
