<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's weariness and stubbornness root motivation concretely, driving micro-choices like fitting the lens despite cold; embodied emotions in "fingers clumsy with cold" reveal contradiction between fatigue and obsession. Final endurance as curator forecloses return to surface life with felt cost in his anchored soul.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from package to library depths, tightening at lens activation ("low hum vibrated... library awoke") into Charged Poise closure where cries gain permanent address. Orientation anchored early; cost legible in Silas's transformation into mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater library constrains navigation ("shelves curved like nautilus shells") and charges final image ("light painting his lined face"); sensory hierarchy (bioluminescent glow, brine waterfalls) filters through undertaker's bias toward rest. Evolving details mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catalogue distress for permanent rest) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening labyrinth immersion; agency in fitting lens forces trade-off of surface life, with cost visible in blurred days and weary soul anchoring. One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving lost cries emerges organically from cataloguing acts, reweighting "chased stillness" into captured peace without moralizing; final image ("steady, guiding beam") offers non-literal answer, charging prior signals with resonant cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (obsession with rest echoes in lens prisms); rhythmic prose modulates from blur of journey to deliberate cataloguing, heightening pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere (e.g., "prismatic facets clouded and webbed with cracks"); varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor repetition of "stubbornness" is voice-motivated. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker mythos with distress-signal mausoleum transforms tropes; risk in impossible-space immersion heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via lens heart pumping "light and order."</comment>
