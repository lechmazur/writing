<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsessed maintenance worker's interiority embodied in scar-healing tingle and micro-choices like repurposing sextant; final shift to shared witnessing earns closure via prior causal build of quantified mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as mist density spikes post-pin "ping," narrowing from scattered readings (7.3, 2.1) to aligned flow; CR closure lands with dial-to-zero cost in tree vision, constraint of sextant persistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower, moonlight, and yew bark constrain choices (sextant view, hand placement) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (echoing ping amid silent leaves) reflects POV attunement, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing dream-mist tightens via pin-induced swirl forcing rush to tree; agency in hand-on-bark crystallizes stance under accumulative lens, cost felt in visions' weight before zero.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow reweighted non-literally by tree's witnessed visions fading dial to zero, emergent from particulars without moralizing; invites reflection on observation as release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (rustling hedges, mist light) and rhythmic control ("tiny, metallic ping" amid thunder); compression purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short ping sentence amid flowing descriptions), no loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks cleanly at "dial suddenly spiked, then swirled" without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant-measured sorrow and pin-key release transforms labyrinth trope; risk in "mundane miracles" heightens stakes organically to inevitable tree-witness CR.</comment>
