<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions (e.g., "cold, heavy stone in her gut" shifting to "quieter, more durable sorrow"); fault-tolerant oracle mind concretely drives micro-choices like data rituals and drawing, earning closure renunciation without safety-hedging. Contradictory impulses act in scene via guilt-sorrow tension. Final drawing reveals values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fever break through illustration realizations to CR closure ("flaw was the record... silent scream frozen on vellum"), reweighting guilt premise with legible conceptual cost in her smudged drawing. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Single scene, no causality breaks; pattern taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (gauges, portfolio) constrains rituals and charges final drawing; auroral light evolves causally ("deepening into morning, hardening into day"), mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (wind as "pushing anthem," tilting floor). No generic placeholders; weather pressures calibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) signaled early, accumulates via illustration deepening that narrows guilt options to sorrow endurance; agency in renunciation (drawing without correction) forecloses tidy certainty with felt emotional cost. One tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "weight... specific. It belonged to the past."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of flawed legacies emerges organically via smudges shifting from error to confession; final image (her smudged saxifrage) offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting margins/resilience without moralizing. Subtext in silences and imperfections invites ambiguity. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (weather-oracle metaphors like "anemometer cups spinning wildly"); rhythmic modulation under reflection pressure, diction biased (e.g., "fault-tolerant oracle"). No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from fever haze to dawn clarity; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak realization ("swallowed truth shifted"). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene (short sentences in rituals). Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle-mind, smudged illustrations, and weather as swaying certainties transforms legacy trope; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable portfolio pivot. Non-obvious angle on confession-as-art.</comment>
