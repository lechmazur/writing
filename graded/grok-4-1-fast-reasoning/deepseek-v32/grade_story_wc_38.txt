<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via dance as code-breaking tool reveals character-specific perception; final realization mirrors Thorne's struggle with earned personal cost. Minor slip: internal conflict accumulates via resonance rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak transfer beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from dice discovery to server hum and journal revelations; CR closure in "encrypted but not imprisoned" reconfigures vulnerability premise with conceptual cost of self-decoding. Dice-to-input causal tightening narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken lab's silt desk, server hum, and ascending corridors constrain choices (e.g., console access) and charge final ascent image. Sensory selectivity (blue gloom, dice click) filters through Elara's lyrical bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal liberation tightens accumulatively via dice-generated sequence unlocking servers, forcing trade-off in deliberate transfer pace. Agency peaks in finger-dance initiation; cost felt in mirrored vulnerability confrontation, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "strength as language" emerges organically from dance-patterns and journal decoding, reweighted in final "self finally decoded" image without statement. Subtext in spider-web motif shifts from method to philosophical resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature in kinetic metaphors (e.g., "slow turn represented a recursive loop"); rhythmic modulation builds to chime cadence. Compression purposeful, taught early via dance, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rolled the hangman's dice... saw the next step"); purposeful spider-web repetition motif avoids loops. Minor long-sentence runs in reflection beats slightly slow propulsion but fit accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hangman's dice as physical cipher transforms code-breaking trope via poetic probability dance; fresh synthesis of vulnerability-encryption philosophy feels inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes through embodied decoding.</comment>
