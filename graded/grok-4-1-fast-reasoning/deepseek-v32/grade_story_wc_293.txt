<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like trembling finger tracing ridge-line; earned change from loss to faith in final walk and tune; contradictory awe kindles visibly without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly with density rising from glint to future vision; on-page Charged Poise closure reconfigures "never" to "what if" with legible emotional cost in "luminous disbelief"; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting of pullout constrains choices (kneels in gravel, sits on boulder) and charges final starry valley image; sensory details POV-filtered (shale eyes, pine air); evolving landscape mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of processing vanishing tightens accumulatively via glass revelations narrowing lament path; agency in recounting/tracing forecloses doubt with cost felt in heart's "feverish clarity"; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absolution for broken images emerges organically through flake's evolution; final future vision offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting loss without moralizing; ambiguity in hitchhiker's nature lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (melodies in rust) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens awe without head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in reflective recounting ("sculpt possibility") dull peak slightly; no artifacts touch closure; metaphors coherent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh magical realism synthesis of wet-plate topography and pixel amnesty transforms vanishing trope; risk-taking in curatorial hitchhiker heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight via flake's logic.</comment>
