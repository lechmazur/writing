<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's frugality as contradictory impulse drives discovery and culminates in earned sacrifice at "Placing his hands upon the warm tile," with embodied laugh revealing irony under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via schematic layering to CR closure; tile alignment causes hum/glow, reconfiguring with conceptual cost in unraveling consciousness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chamber/palace as astrolabe constrains via tile convergence and ziggurat views, charging final scouts' image; selective dusky sensory details mirror internal alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covenant) tightens via irony deepening, forcing total essence trade-off; agency in rotation/sacrifice forecloses frugality with legible cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Irony of devotion emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR in cooled tile/scouts reweights premise without moral; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with astronomical perceptual signature; rhythmic texture modulates from calm schematics to peak "consciousness unraveled," no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; minor figurative density ("figures of fire") in climax purposeful, no loops obscuring schematic starlight closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as cosmic conduit and palace-astrolabe transforms tropes; risk in ironic expenditure inevitable from frugal traits.</comment>
