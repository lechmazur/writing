<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to photosynthesize pain into beauty is consistent and trait-rooted, driving her nightly ritual; shyly unstoppable trait shines against Corvin's skepticism. Lacks embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure due to summary style over dramatized conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from solitude to cultural legacy; CR closure lands in shrine image reweighting longing with healing cost (her death). Episodic chronicle weakens causal linkages, relying on summary transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell's spiraled chambers, acoustics, and absorbed yearnings vividly constrain poetry transmission and charge memories; sensory details like iridescent light and lichen integrate purposefully. Reef-shadow joy mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pain-to-beauty signaled early tightens texturally via Corvin's challenge and conversion, narrowing isolation to shared amplification; cost felt in insomnia's end and death yielding legacy. Pressure coheres but remains gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Blossom armistice emerges organically from poem to cultural shift, resonating in final shrine without statement; reweights pain via lullabies' endurance. Complexity lingers in shy influence vs. profound impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with poetic perceptual signature stable in single POV; diction modulates rhythmically with intensity. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual in Elara-Corvin exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; metaphors purposeful if dense. Minor repetition of "centuries of longing" and joy phrases creates slight paraphrase loops early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fossil-shell poet, wind-lullabies, and galaxy postcard transforms hermit-to-legacy arc organically. Bold fable texture risks summary but heightens poetic resonance.</comment>
