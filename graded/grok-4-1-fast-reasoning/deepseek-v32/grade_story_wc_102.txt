<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in past-life ache intensifies compellingly through breathing revelations; interiority concrete and embodied in the memory of failing the child. Contradictory impulses (withheld compassion vs. present release) act in the opal-holding surge. Final integration earned with visible cost, but minor epiphanic polish at "healing is the act of finding and freeing love's echoes" edges from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to breathing-clarified glow to spark cascade, tightening via memory unlock. Orientation anchored early in viaduct scene. CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in "spaces between breaths" realization; persistent constraint of camera obscura shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wisteria draping iron, foggy lucidity softening details) filter through artist's priorities, constraining choices like pillar walk. Recurring viaduct/object charges final glowing absorption of sparks. Micro-setting (camera obscura ground glass) guides revelation; 9+ test met without slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release stored love) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via breathing-memory escalation narrowing to opal release. Agency in deliberate steps and breath regulation forecloses past wound with legible surge of compassion. One tightening sufficient; cost felt in redistribution, but abstract ache slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of compassion's echoes emerges organically from tear-spark images shifting to "spaces between breaths." Resonant CR ending reweights without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "cycle closed, yet forever open." Protagonist arc inextricable; no thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature (inverted images, energy glows via pinhole). Lyrical rhythm modulates with breath cycles, heightening pressure; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or distance slips; elision of mechanics paid off in revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with breath cadence, high density integrates action-atmosphere; strong verbs propel (e.g., "resolved into the shape of a falling tear"). "Foggy lucidity" exact-repeat x4 creates minor template cadence drag across beats (−0.6), but no closure touch or muddled metaphors. Zero scaffold in peak opal/spark beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura as spiritual tool transforms revelation tropes, with Kwan Yin tear-opal and "pilgrim of sparks" yielding inevitable CR. Bold risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes organically (+0.3). No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity to foggy lucidity payoff.</comment>
