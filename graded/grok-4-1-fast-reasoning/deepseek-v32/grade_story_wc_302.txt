<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Contradictory caution tempers exuberance in embodied micro-choices like acquiring the watch and documenting patterns, earning the final shift to quiet confidence; minor diagnostic repetition of "cautious exuberance" slightly flattens interior peak at pedestal without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of delays/reversals building to CR closure ("truth is in the silence between letters") reweighting quest premise; cost legible in time normalization and poised return, pivotal pedestal moment tightens cleanly with no causality slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist's propagation delays constrain disorienting steps and idea-sequencing early, while library's pulsing shelves charge decoding; recurring glow mirrors internal shift, pivotal in climax without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decipher unspoken words escalates accumulatively via whispers-to-cipher deepening, narrowing options through delays; agency in watch correlation forces trade-off, cost felt in illusions awareness at exit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-between emerges organically from cipher gaps and letter timeframe, resonant CR end reweights without moralizing; pivotal phrase "truth in silence" non-literal answer ties particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (dreamer bias toward whispers/patterns) with rhythmic modulation under mist stress; purposeful poetic compression legible, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but paraphrase loops in "documented" iterations (clues/patterns/insights) and thrice-repeated "cautious exuberance" create minor scaffold drag without obscuring pedestal climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of propagation delays/cyclic reversals transforms mystical quest trope into time-distorted ingenuity; risk of fable texture heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight payoff at "Remember."</comment>
