<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied in "heart pounding with both terror and exhilaration," driving contradictory impulses; endurance earned via doll's activation weaving silences into mastery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of collected silences builds to CR closure—"claustrophobia... stretched and contracted into a manageable shape"—with legible cost of persistent fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Xenial trellis vines constrain edge exploration and sprout silences, charging doll-root image; micro-setting of porcelain doll anchors tactile choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (master fear via silences) escalates accumulatively as "gilded hush thickened... silence was closing in," forcing agency in channeling panic with visible endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emergent theme of silence as dual cage/companion reweighted in tapestry completion; final "gilded hush was a companion, not a cage" resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in silence flavors ("sweet yet metallic, like honeyed brass"); stable single-POV distance modulates with pressure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels, but figurative stack ("tendrils of soundlessness sprout... audible blossoms unfurling") in exploration borders overload; "had sprout" typo dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence flavors, gravity inversion, doll roots transforms claustrophobia into tapestry mastery; inevitable in hindsight from peculiar motivation.</comment>
