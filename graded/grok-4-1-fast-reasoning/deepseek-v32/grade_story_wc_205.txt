<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied time on hands and poetic lens; motivation intensifies from hypothesis to storm-fueled certainty, earning clarity in final reflection. Minor backstory summary dilutes peak pressure but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to storm insight as CR, with cost legible in "aged by the storm's passage, but her eyes held a new clarity." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and visible time constrain devising via mirror ritual; shard and mirror charge final image, filtering through Elara's poetic bias. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under storm urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagining civilization) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ritual and storm to foreclose opposition's view. Cost felt in personal aging acceptance; agency in draping cloth narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transient beauty amid decay emerges via shard's evolving meaning; final image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("metaphors in the drifting dust") modulates with intensity; stable single POV, rhythmic texture apt for lyric mode. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload ("burnished sorrow," "polished shield") in storm beat borders coherence slip (−0.4); minor paraphrase loops on sorrow phrasing. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, mirror ritual, and poetic archaeology transforms tropes; baroque asteroid premise commits boldly, with CR as inevitable payoff.</comment>
