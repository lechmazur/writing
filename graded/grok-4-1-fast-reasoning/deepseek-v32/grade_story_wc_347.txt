<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's reluctance fuels precise micro-choices like nut placement; embodied stress in cold air and urgent hum shows contradiction. Final peace reconfiguration earned via blueprint integration, tempering duty without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as impressions density-build to rescue; orientation anchored early in orchard/labyrinth. Closure Charged Poise in "strange peace assemble" with perpetual duty cost legible in final orchard return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Labyrinth stone, frost, and birds constrain impressions tactics; nut/quartz micro-settings enable shadow/light guides. Sensory hierarchy narrows to urgent tactiles under deadline.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frost accumulation tightens stake, forcing deepening from pebbles to quartz shortcut; agency in non-touch impressions forecloses dead-end. Cost felt in travelers' shiver and her shadowed watch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blueprint/living echo theme emerges via particulars like nut grooves; final image reconfigures reluctance without moral. Graceless beauty motif charges closure organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases to blueprint tactiles; brief dialogue natural/subtextual advances guide. Rhythmic compression suits pressure without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Patterned "graceless beauty" repetition risks loop but serves tone; minor synonym churn in impressions dulls peak density slightly. Propulsion strong overall, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nut-blueprint and shadow impressions synthesize fresh non-touch guidance; transforms maze trope via inherited design. Risky method heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
