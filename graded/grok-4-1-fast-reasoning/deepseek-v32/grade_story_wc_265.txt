<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid interiority through perceptual biases like sound interpretation, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; realization at "Alaric finally understood" feels earned via prior micro-choices yet borders on unembodied epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from dissonance to CR closure ("he, too, was part of the forest's design"); translocations serve motivated ellipses; orientation anchored early in awakening scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest constrains navigation ("sound of wind through different trees") and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (auditory dominance) reflects POV urgency and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mind's frontier) signaled early and tightens at broken tree repair via agency (placing gear); under accumulative lens, pressure coheres to realization with felt integration cost, though no sharp reversal narrows options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mind-forest mirroring emerges organically from particulars like gear-fitting and sound cartography; final CR reweights premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity in "ever-transforming," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in auditory diction and rhythmic modulation (short sentences in revelation); stable close third-person limited with no elision or head-hopping; prose texture fits philosopher's insight hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gear...began to warm, as if reacting"); minor paraphrase loops in "hum of insight" recurrences purposeful under accumulative lens, no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh steampunk-philosophical synthesis transforms tropes via sound-navigation and translocation pilgrimage; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at gear-clutching close.</comment>
