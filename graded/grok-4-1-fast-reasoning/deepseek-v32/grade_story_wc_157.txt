<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's charming rogue traits drive key micro-choices like the Latin recitation shield and "A future" line at climax, earning defiance with embodied stress; minor weakness in limited contradictory impulses beyond competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore chain from seed retrieval to warp pulse; closure lands as Decisive Change with legible cost in 3-second freedom and twisting greenhouse, seed sprouting reconfigures future.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse's humid buzz, pitcher plant, and philodendron cascade constrain hiding/planting choices and charge final sprouting image; sensory details like beetle hum narrow under crisis, fully vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of warping sensors tightens via agent grip on shoulder, forcing palmed-gourd shake; agency forecloses capture with visible cost in disorientation and fading effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Defiance theme emerges organically from botany codes to untaxable roots; final sprouting image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing, charged by prior rebellion particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Leo's botanical perceptual bias (Latin recitation); dialogue like "Just studying..." pursues goals with subtext; rhythmic diction modulates tension without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through chaos beats; purposeful "chaos" motif avoids loops, but minor overwriting in "dizzying symphony" slightly dulls peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thought-tax dystopia with botany rebellion and reality-warping gourd transforms tropes; gourd shake turn feels inevitable from established seed quest, bold without gimmick.</comment>
