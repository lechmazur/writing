<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in impatience-patience tension drives all choices, embodied concretely in "heart a steady drum" and teeth-vibration; internal conflict acts simultaneously at viaduct wait. Final endurance earned by journey meditation. Minor label-speak in "sculpt patience" slightly abstracts peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to moon-viaduct peak; on-page RR (Charged Poise) as "gentle nudge" disrupts Citadel waves with legible conceptual cost of slow unraveling in "one moon path at a time." Orientation anchored early; single-shard journey coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct lodestone constrains alignment choice and charges closure via "ice over deep water" reprise of lake; sensory hierarchy (teeth-hum, boot-pull) reflects Arin's priorities. Environment mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disrupt cognitive yoke) tightens accumulatively to viaduct cadence shift, narrowing via moon precision; agency in guiding field forecloses violent path with patience cost felt in wait. One deepening sufficient, cost unmistakable on slick surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges organically from viaduct whisper vs. impatience burn; final "true revolution... grown, like ice" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like moon tracks drive earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (magnetic pull, moon gaze); rhythmic modulation heightens tension at "viaduct seemed to sigh." Voice texture distinct, purposeful elision of details fits lyric mode taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking sharply at moon intersection. Minor overwrite in stacked figures ("breath held before a song," "sigh") during buildup, but coherent; no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lodestone viaduct, moon calculations, cognitive waves transforms revolution trope into subtle field-nudge; viaduct premise non-obvious, risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
