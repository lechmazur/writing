<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid interiority via coin-tracing and scar-whispering shows contradictory impulses between father's legacy and her compassion; earned ritual renunciation of hardness integrates flaw with cost. Minor diagnostic labels like "unyielding compassion" slightly abstract embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds reflections to Charged Poise closure in reflection ("not the arsonist's daughter, but a woman who carried water into heat"); cost legible in acknowledged scar integration. Orientation anchored early at lagoon edge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon, black sand, and dunes constrain ritual choices and charge final shimmering mirror-image; sensory selection (shadows, paste texture) mirrors renewal via firefighter bias. Recurring clouds evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove scars sing tightens accumulatively through memory-deepening to paste-application reversal, foreclosing unintegrated pain with emotional cost; agency in ritual whispers charges final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from ruin emerges organically via sand-graft and scar-song, reweighting father's destruction in final image without moralizing; lingering ambiguity in "scars would sing" resists tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (fire-born elements as melody) stable in close third; rhythmic modulation fits serene pressure, teaching poetic compression early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in theme restatements ("scars can sing," "unyielding compassion") and synonym churn (coin/red thread phrasing x4) create redundancy across final third, dulling propulsion despite vivid rhythm. Density high but artifacts obscure some cause-effect in reflections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter ritual at volcanic-site transforms arson trope via sand-graft; bold lyric risk in scar-song premise heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
