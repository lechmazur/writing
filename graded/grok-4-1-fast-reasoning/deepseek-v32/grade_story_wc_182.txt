<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore chain from arrival to diary deductions enabling annex entry; CR closure lands on-page as wall dissolves into resonant absence, reweighting library premise with conceptual cost of "refused lessons."</comment>
