<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between guild clutter and simple mist walking act in the kneeling attempt; final "custodian" realization earned by embodied laugh and mending choices with opportunity cost of guild return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from failed protocols to luminance swell, landing CR in "lighthouse for a different kind of brilliance" with conceptual cost of rejecting scalable magic; spire isolation constrains throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of sacred simplicity tightens via luminance invitation narrowing guild path; manual mending embodies agency-driven deepening with visible cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keystone's "residue of joy" reweights automated efficiency premise non-literally in closing image; fragile magic's ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "lingering luminance... memory of sunlight" biases toward subtle magic; rhythmic modulation from quiet to chime-echo laugh heightens revelation.</comment>
