<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied conflict in facing motherhood fears amid solitude loss during repentance, with micro-choices like placing saucer revealing values; final serenity earned via prior ritual causality. Minor slip in direct epiphanic phrasing like "painful clarity" borders therapy-speak but ties to action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual to garden of crystallized seconds, culminating in CR closure where saucer heals and time's dwelling reconfigures, with cost in facing ghosts legible at "her cloudbound repentance began." Orientation anchored early; single-shard structure fits defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Midnight glade's "choking beauty" and "dew-laden ferns" constrain ritual choices and mirror internal sorrow absorption; glade evolves causally with lattice door, charging final descent image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, selective urgency sharpens perception under thinning air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim time) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via repentance demand that narrows to contrition cost; agency in whispering words and twisting will forecloses hoarding path. Escalation peaks legible in "cracking sound... air itself," forcing trade-off without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time in "sacred pause between heartbeats" emerges organically from hand-tracing ritual and saucer healing, reweighting absence to presence without statement; final tablecloth image offers non-literal answer, resonant via prior particulars. Complexity in love-fear wrestle avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "onyx-ink" voids and "silvery wraiths"; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure, prose texture distinct and character-biased. No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, syntax varying for rhythm; minor overwrite in repeated "choking beauty" coherent but risks loop in glade beats. No scaffold or artifacts dull closure; figurative lattice "morphed into a door" clear and integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy quest into cloudbound time-vault via cracked saucer portal transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric mysticism heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from family custom thread to healed relic.</comment>
