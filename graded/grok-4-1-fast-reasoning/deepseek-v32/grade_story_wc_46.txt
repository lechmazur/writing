<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to share light without fire intensifies credibly through embodied handling of sea glass and memory cues, culminating in passing it to the girl as earned renunciation of solitude. Interiority concrete via tactile weighing and doubt ("weigh her decision"), avoiding stock epiphanies. Minor slip: reflective summaries slightly abstract internal conflict rather than simultaneous impulses in pivotal doubt beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resurfacing memories builds to Charged Poise closure as Elara passes sea glass, reconfiguring legacy with felt cost of age ("edges softened further by time"). Orientation anchored early (grotto, mist, glass). One tightening via girl's arrival narrows options from doubt to renewal; time jumps legible via concrete anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto and mist vividly constrain reflection amid storm, mirroring internal calm; sea glass as micro-setting charges final image, handled tactilely ("cradled... weigh its smooth weight"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (starlight on glass hues). Evolves causally with weather contrast, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light sans fire) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory density and storm to girl's arrival tightening into decision with cost (personal absence vs communal endurance). Agency in teaching/passing glass forecloses isolation. Pressure coherent under lens; storm complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reflective light-sharing emerges organically from glass motifs shifting to legacy-passage, resonant non-literal answer in final handoff without moralizing. Subtext in mist-whispers and softened glass implies costs of time. Particulars (gem polishing) avoid platitudes; counter-reading of fire's temptation lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with reflective perceptual signature (starlight in glass); diction poetic yet consistent. Girl's dialogue natural, goal-driven. Minor register elevation in motifs borders committee voice, but rhythm modulates with memory beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive motif churn ("memories resurfaced" x5, "reflectively vibrant" x3, "weigh" x3) creates paraphrase loops dulling propulsion, especially mid-story density without payoff variance. Template cadence in reflective sentences (e.g., "She [action] sea glass..."); −1.2 artifacts. Closure image clear despite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sea glass as light-reflector transforms mentor-torch trope via gem-polishing perceptions. Motifs organically constrain choices. Minor hedge: repeated phrases border template familiarity without bold subversion.</comment>
