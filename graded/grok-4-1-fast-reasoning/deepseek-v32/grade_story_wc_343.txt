<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in honoring mentor via discovery, with isolation as embodied cost reconfigured at end; interiority concrete in pattern-noting but slips into label repetition like "diligently curious." Final endurance of isolation earns stasis with prior buildup. Secondary crew pressure minimal but coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern observations density-build to map realization and charting closure as Charged Poise with isolation cost felt in final image. Orientation anchored early (Elara on airship deck). Single scene causality tight from hopscotch to luminance sighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Airship deck and starling murmurations vividly constrain choices (board cleaning, pattern watching); "sky seemed to weep light" charges final image. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's pattern bias selective and purposeful. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart discovery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern matches tightening to captain pitch and sighting; agency in noting forecloses isolation path with felt cost. One deepening (murmuration peak) narrows options effectively. Low external pressure but internal coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-as-discovery-price emerges organically via pattern-seeing and final reconfiguration ("now a comfort"); hopscotch reprise shifts meaning without statement. Resonance in starling guardians image answers seeing-overlooked question. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern obsession; dialogue natural and advancing ("Aris always said you had the eyes"). Rhythm modulates but minor repetition convergence. No head-hopping; diction fits curious apprentice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Heavy loops in "starling murmurations" (7+ repeats) and "sociable isolation" (4x) create paraphrase churn, dulling density in peak charting beat; template cadence in noting descriptions. Rhythm varies but scaffold drags momentum. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-map to stranded luminance fresh synthesis transforms airship tropes via patterns; risk in sociable isolation evolution heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious constellation link inevitable in hindsight. No derivative templates.</comment>
