<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to witness change without judgment is consistent and intensifies through embodied perceptions like "time not as a line but as a layered tapestry." Interiority concrete and particular, with loose grip on reality enabling fluid navigation of layers. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal burrow moment, reducing micro-choice depth; endurance of decay feels earned but serene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via layered journeys to regenerative silence core. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in final swan fold—"ready for the next descent"—reweights perpetual cycle with conceptual cost of endless decay/renewal legible on page. Orientation anchored early in catacombs; structure coherent across shards without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (moss on shelves, obsidian hum) filter through Keeper's priorities, mirroring internal states. Origami swan as recurring tool constrains choices and charges final image. Environment guides descent, with hut and library evolving causally to deepen silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of regenerative silence signaled early, escalates accumulatively through burrow deepening density and reweighting perception. Agency in deliberate tracing of folds forces trade-off of surface peace for core decay. Cost felt in "beautiful, slow collapse" acceptance, charging final poise; pressure coherent but quietly meditative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of non-judgmental witnessing emerges organically from decay/renewal images, culminating in resonant final image of tucked swan without moralizing. Subtext in gaps between sounds enriches complexity. Avoids platitudes through particular vine-ledger tracing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature: loose reality grip yields biased, tapestry-like noticing. Rhythmic prose modulates poetically with intensity, syntax reflecting meditative mind. Purposeful compression legible, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but patterned loops ("drift of untold seasons" x4, "crumbling peace" x3) create mild paraphrase churn across beats, dulling some propulsion. Figurative language coherent without muddle; sentence variety supports meditative cadence. Minor repetition touches closure image but pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami portal and regenerative silence transforms contemplative tropes into lived ritual. Risky lyric structure heightens perceptual stakes organically. Non-obvious final reconfiguration of decay as renewal feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
