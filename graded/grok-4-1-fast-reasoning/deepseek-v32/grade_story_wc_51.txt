<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions like "cold stone in the chest" and contradictory impulses (trapped in recursion vs. purposeful weaving) earn the final endurance; micro-choices reveal values. Minor epiphanic telling in "He realized that collecting weights was not about bearing them" slightly abstracts the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with layering burdens deepening to lamp alignment as tightening; on-page RR/Charged Poise closure ("carrying no burdens, only the knowledge of their shapes") lands with conceptual cost of accepting infinite recursion. Anchors clear early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze walls reflect starlight to pool and guide weaving; lamp and hush constrain choices (silence/precision required, alignment shifts perspective). Grotto "warms" and "hums" charges final image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burdens without calcifying) signaled early; memory-weaving traps him, lamp adjustment deepens under accumulative lens, narrowing to release with agency. Cost legible in "adrift... no shore" struggle foreclosing unoriented path.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mapping infinite burdens emerges organically via woven patterns; final image ("cathedral of fractured light," extinguishing lamp) offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting traps as frameworks without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with fractal-biased perceptual signature ("lattice of repeating curves," "thorny fronds"); rhythmic poetic diction modulates from desperation to poise, consistent under pressure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; purposeful motif repetition ("shingled hush") taught early without loops dulling propulsion. Minor −0.3 for adjacent paraphrase ("to calcify was his fear... necessary pause") but rhythm varies, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal sorrow/joy weaving transforms abstract conceit into tactile craft; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable reconfiguration ("knowledge of their shapes"). No derivative echoes.</comment>
