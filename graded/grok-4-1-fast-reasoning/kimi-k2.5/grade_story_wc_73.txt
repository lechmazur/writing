<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist traits compel higher-stakes proof-writing amid exhaustion, with contradictory impulses in "smiling at the cosmic absurdity while her fingernails bled"; final theorem earned by hesitation's texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to rupture's CR, where "stone ruptured... with a profound, ringing silence" reconfigures eternal trap into finite memory with legible opportunity cost; orientation anchored immediately, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Staircase and dice constrain choices (descent refusal, asymmetry glitch), charging final fissure image; selective tactility like "marble that never warmed" mirrors internal boundless pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture texture) tightens texturally through proofs and dice placement, forcing trade-off in abandoning observation; agency drives rupture with cost in "preserved... finite" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Imperfection-vs-perfection theme emerges organically from chipped die and proofs, resonant in final "gritty, golden, impossible texture" reweighting infinity's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mathematical-tactile noticing ("angle of descent against the coefficient of regret"); rhythmic modulation peaks cleanly at "dice... showing snake eyes."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; figurative language like "theorems cascading like waterfalls" coherent and pattern-taught, no artifacts dulling rupture clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh math-asymmetry escape transforms infinite-trap trope, with dice chip's "irregular edge" enabling bold observer-abandonment payoff that feels inevitable.</comment>
