<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in skepticism drives patient waiting, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or visible flaws complicating choices; endurance feels earned yet untested by mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to resonant reconfiguration (memories rising/settling); closure Charged Poise with legible cost in geese resumption and frost threat line "only until the geese resumed their southward flight."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (mica flakes, crunching leaves, glass hum) constrain path and charge final image of memories in basins; recurring fountains mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate before geese fly) signaled early with textural tightening via star alignment amid stirring wings; agency in precise thumb press forecloses path with felt time cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of buried history's defiance emerges organically from particulars like rising memories; final image reweights premise without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (doubt as light, silence as water) modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language pattern-taught in lyric mode pays off crisply at "ice breaking on a river in spring" climax sound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of geese pocket, mica breadcrumbs, physics-anchored magic; risk-taking in sidereal alignment heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
