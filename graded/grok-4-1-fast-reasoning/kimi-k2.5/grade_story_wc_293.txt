<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like fingers itching for silence yielding to playing until they bleed, reveal internal contradiction between trauma-induced "never" and reconstruction. Final choice earned by flake-guided realizations. Minor over-articulation of epiphanies ("pixelated amnesty suddenly clarified") borders diagnostic without full deduction as it doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vanished hitchhiker to flutters' map, glass revelation, and fiddle play as Conceptual Repricing reconfiguring "never" into possibility. Closure lands on-page with legible cost ("fingers bled"; flake dissolves). Orientation anchored early (pullout, three minutes post-vanishing); single scene with purposeful ascent tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap flutters and glass flake constrain choices (maps path upward) and charge final image (illuminate site into "negative space of potential"). Sensory hierarchy (ozone/pine, thinning air, dying light) filtered through fiddler's perceptual bias; evolves causally with altitude and dusk. No white-room; micro-setting (flake as lens) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome trauma's "never") signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening realizations narrowing to play despite cost. Agency in following flutters and striking notes forecloses silence path. Escalation coherent under lens; fingers-bleed price unmistakable, charges Charged Poise closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconstruction from breakage emerges organically via pixelated amnesty motif shifting from degradation to "reassembled into something permissible," reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: hitchhiker-as-bridge spans refusal of finality. Particulars (flake, flutters, blood) drive earned insight, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (bridge geometries, resonances in wind/glass/blood); poetic compression taught early via fiddler voice, legible at closure. Rhythmic syntax modulates intensity (short urgent sentences in ascent/play). No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge (hitchhiker path via flutters).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful (e.g., "metallic exoskeleton") without muddle, supporting accumulative texture. Minor repetition of "flutters" and "pixelated amnesty" pattern-taught for motif, not loop. Varied rhythm holds read-aloud; no scaffold in peak play beat ("notes struck the wet-plate fragment").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wet-plate flake + bridge-song fiddler + scaffold-map transforms trauma trope into luminous reconstruction, inevitable in hindsight. Bold risks (lyric ascent, dissolving artifact) heighten stakes without gimmickry; irreplaceable conceptual angle on forgiveness via pixels.</comment>
