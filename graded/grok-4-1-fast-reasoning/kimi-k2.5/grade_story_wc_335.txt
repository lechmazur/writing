<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory retreat/advance dance embodies anxiety while compelling the shadow's growth; final forward walk earns mutual change with relational cost of no embrace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via ritual density to hammer fall (DC) and swing's stillness (RR), cost legible in child's tremble and Elara's un-retreating step.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Playground swing recurs from drifting hush to final stillness, constraining metaphor and charging closure; library dust/samovar integrate tactilely into tea rituals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ritual deepenings (posture shifts, leaf spirals) accumulate under textural lens, narrowing to hammer readiness with cost of potential waste-away foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Swing motif shifts from abandonment to earned stasis, reweighting "push through pain" in non-literal final walk without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in geometric readings (leaves, shard) biases vividly; rhythmic modulation sustains combative tenderness through dialogue subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms in rituals; minor figurative density (e.g., "blade wrapped in velvet") coheres without obscuring hammer beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shard-mirror/tea geometry synthesis transforms exile premise boldly, inevitable in shatter and swing-stilling reconfiguration.</comment>
