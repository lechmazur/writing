<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to compress eternity drives consistent micro-choices like frost study and press alignment, earning the rupture; her destabilizing attribute manifests concretely in smudges and cracks. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses slightly limits depth, shown as competent obsession without visible hesitation in the climax press moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns accumulate to bottled whisper, press, and rupture DC with conceptual cost to stasis as glass remembers sand and books awaken. Single scene anchors orientation early; closure reconfigures infinite stasis into change with undeniable price in the final breathing image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass orchard library and cloud-sea constrain choices (frost sigils guide bottle selection, branches hold books for rupture); sensory details like ink-stained fingers and platen whisper filter through Elara's priorities, evolving causally to charge the spiderwebbing crack and rustling pages climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (destabilize stasis) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via frost-to-print deepening that forecloses perfect eternity; agency in press lever and trunk press forces trade-off with reality's reluctance, cost legible in churning storms and page-turning violence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stasis vs. beautiful change emerges organically from frost rupture channeling whisper into awakening; final image of rustling books offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting perfection's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (veined geometries, crystalline branches) biases noticing toward rupture points; rhythmic prose modulates from static description to dynamic groan/crack under pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "vacuum abhorred matter") propels accumulatively, rhythm varies for ear; minor metaphor density in opening risks slight opacity but ties to closure without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal stasis shattered by encoded whisper transforms tropes of eternal library into inevitable rupture; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, with bottled whisper's vibration recharging childhood rustling organically.</comment>
