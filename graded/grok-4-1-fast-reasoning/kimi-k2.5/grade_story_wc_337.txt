<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in brokenness compel endurance; confession while unraveling reveals values hierarchy with cost in "silence settled into Mira's broken mask." Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density of unraveled spirits and accumulated silence builds to Charged Poise RR closure where "she had become the net now" reconfigures her role with undeniable cost in final stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's starlight "splitting the darkness into manageable colors" and obsidian table constrain needle work and charge final image; selective sensory hierarchy (hummed walls, shifting shadows) mirrors internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grounding spirits escalates via accumulative density ("lucid unrest intensified, the starlight sharpening into blades") forcing endurance; visible cost in silence filling cracks charges closure image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of broken vessels holding others' silence emerges organically from unraveling and confession; final image of "heavy, holy silence she had chosen to carry" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in fractured, prismatic noticing; rhythmic syntax modulates with intensity, prose as character in "accumulated silence that pooled... like water in a well."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful figurative pattern (silence as substance) taught early pays off without muddle, though minor elevated diction density in mid-beats slightly slows peak unraveling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi-inspired mask restorer exhuming ghosts via nets transforms tropes into inevitable conceptual shift; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes in "becoming a repository."</comment>
