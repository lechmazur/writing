<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to prove sideways time intensifies credibly through prior skepticism at dinner and lever pull, with embodied icy warmth as validation; internal conflict subtle in volunteering for avoided shifts. Minor slip: Dr. Vex's late entry dilutes relational crucible without prior pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup to lever pull (inciting) and data streams (CR closure via future timestamps), reweighting time premise with conceptual cost of defying linear causality. Orientation anchored early in station and twilight; single scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Xenobiology station and tundra constrain choices via thermal regulator against winds and Drakes' roosts enabling nexus; final warm air pulsing with proof charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy (frost creeping, wing hush) filters through mechanic's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, tightens via lever pull forcing observation under nexus pressure; agency in sequence narrows to validation cost (Dr. Vex's prior laugh as opposition). Escalation accumulates texturally to data confirmation without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of lateral time emerges organically from Drake dreams and data, reweighting causality via final skiffs-across-ice image without moralizing; subtext in Vex's dawning ties scientist-mechanic tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias (chronometer hesitation, holographic mapping); rhythm modulates from setup hush to nexus density. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven in gesture over words.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.6<comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("ink diffusing," "ripples spreading," "swim through hours") during nexus flare risks coherence without pattern payoff; no loops, clear propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanic's holographics and Drake biology transforms temporal trope into sideways proof; risk in sci-fi conceit heightens stakes via nexus constraint on inciting lever.</comment>
