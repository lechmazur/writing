<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Esoteric realist motivation clear and intensifies through ritual knotting, with embodied precision ("feeling the give of the chitin") revealing refusal to romanticize loss; earned stasis in transient rooting forecloses preservation path with dignity cost. Minor slip: diagnostic label-speak ("esoteric realist in her recognized") borders therapy abstraction without full embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of towers accumulates remembrance patterns, taught early via first knot, tightening to dismantle/release cadence shift. Closure as Conceptual Repricing ("only by accepting impermanence could she make the history last") lands on-page with conceptual cost of witnessed ending legible in final knot/leave image. Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verdant grotto's thin oxygen/ferns constrain transient rooting, charging final butterfly lift-off/dismantle; body as micro-setting (knees in moss, fingers on wing) mirrors internal yield. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: wing iridescence prioritized over clouds, evolving causally with sun climb. No generic placeholders; tactile integration propels ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor histories pre-extinction) signaled para 1, tightens accumulatively via staggered wings/nightfall clock narrowing to final tower; agency in build/signal/release forecloses save-species path. Cost visible in dismantle ("its story now absorbed"), but lacks deeper trade-off beyond endurance to fully charge 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence-through-witness emerges organically from knot/release cycle, reweighting "magic as physics of attention" via wing towers; final paradox smile offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (moth wing yield) avoids platitudes; minor overtness in "grammar of remembrance" slightly abstracts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: esoteric precision biases to wing textures/cadences; rhythmic modulation accelerates in knot ("pulled the knot tight") under ritual pressure. Lyrical diction consistent, no elision; prose as character reflects realist poise without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "knot was not permanent—nothing here was"); rhythmic variety in para lengths/ openings suits accumulative cadence. Patterned repetition ("interrupted cadence," "blushing stillness") taught early pays off texturally without loop penalty; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors dulls one peak knot beat (−0.4 routed here).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: extinction ritual via grass/spider-silk towers transforms trope of witnessing loss into tactile hieroglyphs; bold lyric risk (repetitive motifs) heightens stakes of forgetting. Final CR inevitable from early transients, no hedging; irreplaceable grotto physics anchors universal.</comment>
