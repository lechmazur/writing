<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthesia and cell-division embodiment root motivation deeply, with micro-choices like imprinting revealing values under dying pressure; backstory betrayal diagnostically told ("sepia brown") slightly flattens present contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds absences to CR closure in "trust sounds like holding your breath," with cost legible in "regrets in perfect clarity" as cells divide; orientation anchored early in greenhouse/shipwrecks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ashen forge and dead trees constrain imprinting and act as antennae, charging final shudder; sensory hierarchy (aurora's G-sharp tasting copper) filters through synesthetic POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture trust's break tightens via forge imprint, narrowing options under textural lens; agency in collecting absences forecloses paths with dying-cells cost, legible in final fitting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Memories as shifted frequencies reweights absences into resonant CR without moralizing; final "exhaling" image answers trust's sound non-literally from particulars like rust-forming pitch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("high G-sharp that made her teeth ache") biases noticing consistently; rhythmic compression modulates with intensity, stable close-third POV teaches lyric elision payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and multi-job lines; figurative density in peak imprint ("rust forming on steel") borders overwriting but coheres in taught lyric pattern without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic acoustics of absences transforms hearing-aid trope into fresh memory-scar premise; risk-taking in textural CR ("library of silences") feels inevitable from shipwreck voids.</comment>
