<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scattered consciousness embodies motivation with concrete fragmentation, driving micro-choices like shard-gathering and song-weaving; wholeness at closure earned via prior binding efforts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sonic density builds to RR closure in dawn release; cost legible in fragile photons' swaddling against encroaching dark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mica window and crystalline roots constrain ritual choices, charging final light-unwrap with environmental pressure; sensory filter (glowing fruit, vibrating planes) mirrors urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, escalates via song intensification drawing inhabitants; agency in swaddling forecloses extinction path with felt photon fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of binding/release emerges from weaving action and communal chorus; final dawn image non-literally reweights memory-into-light premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in alchemical diction; rhythmic modulation builds to release note, elisions taught early as scattered selves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful weaving metaphors, but stacked figuration ("binding and liberating simultaneously, a tone of bound release") borders overwrite in build-up.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic alchemy and communal memory transforms dawn trope; risk in scattered POV heightens stakes to inevitable wholeness.</comment>
