<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in petrichor quest, with micro-choices like gripping compass revealing "sensibly eccentric" traits under descent pressure. Final endurance of wonder over explanation earns change with felt conceptual cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal psychometry beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory vials and builds density through vision-descent-lagoon shards to CR closure: "mystery was not ignorance to be cured but wonder to be cultivated," with undeniable conceptual cost of unmaking certainty legible in final breathing image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening at compass psychometry holds lens cleanly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (petrichor, ozone mist, mirror-black water) filtered through collector's bias constrains choices like hammering calcite and charges final flowstone shelf image. Environment evolves causally (temperature inversion, bioluminescent vaults), mirroring internal revelation without overt symbolism. Recurrent vials/tool as micro-setting anchor tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (impossible petrichor source) signaled early tightens accumulatively via psychometry reversal narrowing rational paths, forcing delve agency with escalating density to Charged Poise at lagoon. Cost legible in dimming headlamp and foreclosed "laboratory analysis" yielding "only confusion." Single decisive deepening suffices; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mystery over explanation emerges organically from petrichor quest and hinged visions, culminating in resonant final image reweighting premise: rational world "exhaled" as "something older breathed in," without moralizing. Subtext in compass's "final message" and upward-falling rain invites ambiguity with emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in scent/psychic bias; voice modulates rhythmically from precise vial labels to hushed lyricism at "velvet silence." Diction reflects collector's eccentric idiom without register drift; purposeful compression in descent elided via "string unwinding" pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: syntax varies (short punches in "darkness, then wet stone, finally chamber") supporting accumulative texture; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite figurative density taught early. Final line image recharges motifs cleanly; zero artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry-compass guiding to impossible petrichor in sealed chamber transforms trope of lost expedition into conceptual risk on "places exist to unmake certainty." Bold accumulative hinge structure heightens stakes; irreplaceable particulars like "rain on dry soil" without sunlight feel inevitable.</comment>
