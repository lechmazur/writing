<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in dynasty-ending purpose drives precise micro-choices like silent turning and copying; embodied anticipation via warm crank adds particularity. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure: copying symbols before waves dissolve, cost legible in wavering dust and spring rundown. Orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sepia room's dust motes constrain silence and form legible letters, charging final image of trembling symbols; sensory vanilla scent and amber light filter through POV urgency. Recurrent golden shadows mirror revelation's fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-uncovering deepens accumulatively as waves reveal graves, narrowing to copy before fade with silence cost. Agency in turning/copying forecloses verbal disruption path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resonant silence unveiling tyrannical rot emerges organically from dust letters and crank's turning; final copying reconfigures truth-over-violence without moralizing. Resonance in gardens-over-graves image lingers with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of intuitive translation and eloquent silence; rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory warmth to wavering tension. Distinct texture in biased noticing of acoustic geometry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel revelation; purposeful figurative pattern (e.g., frozen constellations) taught early without muddle. Minor overuse of light metaphors ("golden shadows") in peak beats slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics revealing mass graves transforms documentation trope; risk in dust-letter resonance feels inevitable to closure. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes.</comment>
