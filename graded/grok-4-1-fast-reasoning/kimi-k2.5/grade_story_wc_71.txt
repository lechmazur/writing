<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via orris root warming and noticing instincts reveals particular traits under subtle pressure; motivation to understand intensifies credibly through cataloged wrongnesses. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making endurance feel observational rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early pattern-teaching (displaced objects) through CR closure in crystalline shard discovery and cottage's awakened glow, with cost in her attention consecrating boundary. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (copper light, violet scent, streetlight hum) filter through POV bias, constraining choices via seawall and siding access; lilacs and driftwood evolve to charge final glowing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding aliveness) signaled early tightens accumulatively via shard find narrowing to gesture with felt cost of awakening houses further. Agency in tracking method forces stance crystallization without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of noticing as consecration emerges organically from particulars (displaced objects, hush shard), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; resonant ambiguity lingers in architecture-entity boundary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (doorknobs slower, shadows pooling) sustains lyrical voice; rhythmic modulation heightens hushed intensity without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varies openings and lengths, propelling via image integration; minor figurative density in revelation beat ("salt forming on glass") borders overwrit but pattern-taught without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of houses as vibrational sponges accumulating consciousness transforms haunted-house trope through grounded noticing logic; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
