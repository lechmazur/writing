<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elio's motivation to catalog silences drives consistent micro-choices like tuning frequencies, with embodied emotion peaking in "tears of theatrical sincerity"; internal harmony lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but final writing choice feels earned with attunement cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build to clasp opening (DC) and writing (CR), with legible cost in "surrendering one's own frequency"; single scene anchors early ("shadowed workshop under stars"), no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop tools like "resonating table" and "crystal oscillators" constrain tuning choices and charge final image of diary closing; fireworks contrast silences purposefully, with sensory bias via Elio's frequency perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to open diary via attunement escalates accumulatively through frequency trials (7hz to 4.5hz), narrowing options with surrender cost; agency in "fingers...danced" drives closure tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as "convergence of wavelengths" emerges via tuning events, resonating in final "silence of a world that might yet learn to listen" without moralizing; reweights premise through attunement image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in frequency-sensing ("microscopic tremors"); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to reverent, diction biased toward silences and harmonics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in tuning beats; minor paraphrase loops on "silence varieties" (e.g., heartbeats, forgiveness) dull slightly without obscuring clasp-opening propulsion.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism, silence cataloging, and frequency locks transforms tropes organically; risk in "empathy as measurable phenomenon" heightens stakes, inevitable in clasp "sigh."</comment>
