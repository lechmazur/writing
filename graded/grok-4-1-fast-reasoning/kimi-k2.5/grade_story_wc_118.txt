<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to collect wall stories intensifies compellingly through discoveries; embodied emotion peaks in tears on dragon's wing revealing character under pressure. Interiority concrete and particular in palm against concrete feeling silo memories. Minor slip: lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, steady pursuit without strong internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from diaries to tapestry to wall shudder; closure as Charged Poise in archiving fragment and reading aloud reconfigures purpose with legible cost (stained fingers, tears). Orientation anchored early in silo library. One tightening via tapestry discovery narrows to restoration hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silo walls constrain probing and charge final image of speaking stories aloud; sensory hierarchy (tactile concrete, crumbled leather, dust motes) reflects perceptual bias. Details evolve causally (fireplace diaries to wall memory release). Purposeful selectivity mirrors internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring dreams via wall stories signaled early, tightens accumulatively through deepening discoveries forcing endurance with on-page cost (wept silently, transcribed through night). Agency in probing and reading crystallizes stance. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory shift to architecture emerges organically from particulars (dragons as axis, walls storing dreams); final reading offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting loss without moralizing. Subtext in tapestry-weaver foresight enriches ambiguity. No tidy binaries, embraces world's irrevocable tilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in object-resonance (nerves into aggregate); voice texture modulates rhythmically from quiet probing to bronze-voiced reading. Purposeful poetic compression taught early fits lyric mode. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "leather bindings crumbled like dead leaves" advances setting/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduct for dense figuratives throughout without peak restraint ("bronze quiet" purposeful repeat), but no loops/muddle obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tilt world where dreams embed in concrete transforms post-apoc trope; risk in mythic-weaving payoff heightens stakes organically. Final dragons-into-deliverance feels inevitable from established particulars. No derivative hedging.</comment>
