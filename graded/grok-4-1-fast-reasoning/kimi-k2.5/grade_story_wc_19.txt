<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—claustrophobia versus horizon-need—embody in trembling hands and desperate climb, compelling the capture choice with visible cost in descent; no unearned epiphanies, fully character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ascent to gilded hush capture (climax) to doll-as-heart closure (RR/CR), with cost legible in "weight of the world crashing into her shoulders"; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Xenial trellis constrains choices via sway and time limit, charging final descent image; sensory hierarchy (ozone air, shimmering hush) POV-filtered and purposeful, evolving causally with inversion's end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture hush) signaled early, escalates via coherent pressure under Accumulative lens—clouds churning forces run-back trade-off; agency in doll-press peaks with felt cost in ballast-heavy descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of balance via limitation emerges organically from flowers/doll reprise, final image resonantly reweighting "sprout even in darkness" without moralizing; subtext in intangibly tangible hush layers emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("flavors of different silences," "stretching contracted rhythm") stable in close third, rhythmic control heightens pressure; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm passes ear test; figurative consistency ("gilded hush heavy as gold leaf") purposeful in lyric mode but slight overload in capture beat dings from peak perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Bold premise synthesis (inversion physics, silence vessels) feels inevitable in hindsight; risk of lyric worldbuilding heightens stakes via trellis constraints, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
