<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation to preserve songs drives release of meteorite, with contradictory sell/disappear impulse acting in "weight of that choice pressed against her chest." Interiority particular via dust mapping and trust erosion; earned change from isolation to vulnerability at descent. Minor reflective summary slightly abstracts peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from meteorite arrival through dust patterns to Charged Poise closure in Orion's release and dust's "new constellation," reconfiguring isolation with vulnerability cost legible in "true name ready on her lips." Orientation anchored early in attic/skylight. One tightening via decision suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust motes and skylight constrain navigation choice ("taught her exactly how the birds navigated") and charge final image ("dust settled slowly, mapping a new constellation"). Sensory specifics (foxing paper, pigeon feed) filter through POV urgency; attic hides/pressures via detectives below. Evolving mildew/books mirror internal blooming withering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve songs vs. detection/paper trails) signaled early, tightens texturally via dust-method realization narrowing to release/renunciation. Agency in attaching chip/release forecloses hiding with exposure cost felt in trembling fingers and descent. Coherent pressure culminates in stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of trust over hoarding emerges organically from dust spirals, blooming withering, and release, reweighting reinvention in final image of dust constellation and true-name readiness without moralizing. Subtext in meteorite's "songs" vs. paper trails enriches via particulars; resonant non-literal closure answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in dust/echo patterns; rhythmic lyricism modulates from calm mapping to tense release ("trembling fingers"). No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful compression of reflection anchors to present cues like meteorite touch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., dust motes advance navigation/atmosphere); varied rhythm suits lyric accumulation without loops. Minor overwriting in repeated "dust motes" and "blooming withering" purposeful as pattern, not artifact; clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeon meteorite courier, dust navigation, and attic "blooming withering" transforms identity/relic tropes into textural drive toward trust release. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes via irreplaceable meteorite/dust logic; no derivative templates.</comment>
