<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of scholar vs. dreamer act simultaneously in the starlings observation and horse offering, earning the integrative closure choice with embodied weeping and warmth in chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from starlings patterns to crystal amplification, landing CR closure in final orchard image with felt cost of surrendered rigidity; orientation anchored by veil of water in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard's petrichor air and silver bark constrain ritual choices and charge final image of grazing horse among quicksilver roots; sensory details filtered through alchemist's dual gaze evolve with transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harmonizing logic/intuition signaled early tightens via starlings insight, forcing flame-agency with deepening cost in "burned away the boundary"; lens-consistent pressure reweights options legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reason as "intuition with sleeves rolled up" emerges organically from horse transformation and starlings theorems, offering resonant CR in final smile without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "algorithms too complex for mathematics yet instantly recognizable to the heart" biases noticing toward spiral geometry, modulating rhythm with pressure into charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated images, but figurative density peaks overwritingly in transformation beat ("spectrum that bathed the orchard in dawn") without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual via starlings choreography and sentimental toy horse transforms tropes, with starlings descent risking bold lyric payoff that inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
