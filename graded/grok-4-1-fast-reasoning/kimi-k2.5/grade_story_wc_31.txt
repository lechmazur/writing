<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's covenant intensifies through purposeful wandering to the violet revelation; interiority concrete in embodied wonder at the shimmer. Limited contradictory impulses, but final understanding of 12 years' shifts as beacons earns closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure at "our words are light we cannot see until we listen in the dark," reweighting premise with 12-year opportunity cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early by pier lamps and ship; single scene holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library's air pocket and porthole constrain descent and revelation, charging final violet dance amid floating books. Sensory details like "bleeding green copper stains" filter through Elias's priorities, mirroring internal quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to witness chromatic resonance signaled early via key tag; escalation deepens accumulatively when fork strike yields violet, narrowing to personal theorem with visible cost of lifelong "drown in the dark." Agency in descent and strike coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sound's hidden hue emerges organically from synesthetic research, culminating in resonant CR without moralizing: final image reweights vows as luminous traces. Particulars like tuning fork avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature biased toward light/sound (e.g., "whisper of countless burning wicks"); rhythmic modulation heightens hush to shimmer without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative density (e.g., "dust made of amethyst") borders overwriting in revelation beat without obscuring closure. No loops; varied syntax supports ear-test rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Synesthetic harmonics in sunken library transforms ghost ship trope via specific research ledger and violet C revelation; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risking lyric hush for charged payoff.</comment>
