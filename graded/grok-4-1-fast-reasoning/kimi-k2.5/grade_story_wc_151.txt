<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-choices like CRT juxtaposition and chalk decoding reveal inventive competence under time pressure, earning the memory-transfer renunciation; embodied desperation in "fingers smudging rainbow dust" grounds motivation without contradiction slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build (indentations to chalk matrix) tightening to CR closure in drone departure and chalk left to erode, reweighting analog ephemerality with obsolescence cost legible in "pastel smears."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arcade's CRT glow and outside chalk constrain decoding choices, charging final image where "golden arcade seemed to sigh" mirrors tactile loss; sensory hierarchy (light contrasts, chalk texture) filters through Kael's analog bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode before drone) signaled early tightens via chalk discovery narrowing options under accumulative lens; agency in feverish translation carries time/ephemerality cost to charged poise at mailing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of physical anonymity emerges organically from margin-decoding and chalk ephemerality, with final "messages...visible only to those who knew to look between the lines" offering non-literal CR reweighting digital futures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of analog textures (e.g., "texture of paper, irregularity of handwriting"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure image without drift or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (e.g., "ghost letters pressed into the paper"); metaphors consistent in nostalgic pattern without muddle or loops, propelling to closure despite minor overwriting in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hopscotch cipher transforms cyberpunk tropes into fresh analog subversion, with chalk-to-smears arc feeling inevitable; risk of whimsy-heightened stakes charges CR without gimmickry.</comment>
