<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied conflict in "charcoal-stained fingers trembling" and accused eyes reveal hollow sympathy as flaw driving redesign; final shift to cartographer earned via micro-choices under pressure without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as thread density and memory releases tighten toward trapdoor descent and lamp ignition as Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost in "luminescent ache"; orientation anchored early, one meaningful deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like "sea wind whispered through cracked windows" and "stone tightening as if...a fist" constrains choices (collapsing shelves force speed) and charges final chamber image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping fragmented crush escalates accumulatively via knot releases complicating memories and walls closing faster, forcing agency in sorting; cost legible in pooling water and ache persisting to end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redesigning broken realities emerges organically from thread-weaving and tarot fusion without statement; resonant non-literal answer in "every ending simply a tangle," reweighting portrait traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with painterly perceptual signature ("canvas keeps tearing") and modulating lyrical rhythm heighten surreal pressure; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but minor motif repetition ("walls close in") thrice creates subtle paraphrase loop without obscuring closure; metaphors coherent, no artifacts in peak ignition beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot-self faces, bioluminescent timeline-threads, and painter-cartographer arc transforms lighthouse trope; risk in surreal redesign inevitable from early particulars.</comment>
