<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between pension risk and duty act simultaneously in the adjustment beat; final falsification earned by prior discovery causality with silence cost legible in "conspiracy of kindness that stretched across time."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density tightens to Charged Poise closure; cost undeniable in "hid his conservation modifications behind routine maintenance logs and falsified efficiency reports," reconfiguring options with felt secrecy price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Volcanic setting constrains choices like steadying on fluted column and measuring foundation stones; recurring "building breathed" motif charges final "amphitheater sighed around him with... gratitude."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (modern output vs. ancient restraint) signaled early tightens accumulatively through deciphering to refusal; agency in "adjusted the primary regulator... honoring those anonymous engineers" forecloses upgrade path with discovery-risk cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time-spanning compassion emerges organically from satchel decode and chain reprise; final image of coiling chain as "talisman linking... ancient wisdom" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological engineering as moral architecture with volcano "breathing" motif transforms trope of hidden wisdom; risk in "fractions of millimeters" revolution heightens stakes organically.</comment>
