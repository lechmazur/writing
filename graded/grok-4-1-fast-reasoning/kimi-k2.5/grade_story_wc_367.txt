<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in preservation burns clear, embodied in "chest felt full of shadowed elation, a joy so heavy it tasted like ink and ozone"; micro-choices like whispering to the wick reveal values under pressure. Contradictory impulses in laughing amid extinction's gravity earn the release. Minor abstraction in prophetic hymn slightly dilutes interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ritual and imagery builds to CR closure in beam release, reweighting dawn with "rustle of turning pages"; cost legible in "fragile wick of civilization between thumb and forefinger." Orientation anchored early in lighthouse and post-newspaper void. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse constrains via spiral stairs and vibrating stones syncing laughter to earth; wick as micro-setting charges final cooling in pocket. Sensory hierarchy (ozone taste, hot glass) filtered through herald's storm-perception. Details evolve causally with hum and release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to avert "blank white glare of oblivion" signaled early, tightens texturally via prophetic hymn and photon imprisonment, forcing release trade-off. Cost felt in wick's heat and extinction gravity charging final image. Agency in initiating reflection and pouring shadows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory needing shadows emerges organically from ink/ozone joy and shadow-seeds growing parchment; final dawn image offers resonant answer without statement. Complexity in shadowed elation avoids tidy moral. No counter-readings forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in storm-static fingers and spectral geometries; rhythmic prose modulates from chuckling thunder to wind-laughter. Stable close-third POV, no leakage. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like photons pooling into "liquid luminescence" propel accumulatively; rhythm varies for ear. Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "laughed/laughter" and "shadowed elation" slightly drag momentum without obscuring release. No filter stacks or muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse ritual, print-death world, and light-physics metaphor transforms trope into "shadows thick with newsprint"; risk in poetic fantasy heightens stakes. Irreplaceable conceptual integrity to premise.</comment>
