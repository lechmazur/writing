<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in matching scars/tremor on father's hands and hers forces micro-choice to expose negative to lightning, earning closure renunciation of silence with inherited cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (timer, negative, scars) tightens to CR closure when negative clarifies under lightning, reweighting vigil with conceptual cost of passing testimony; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory constrains pivotal exposure choice via lightning and glass dome, charging final descent image; sensory hierarchy (violet phosphorescence, groaning wind) filters through Elara's photographic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform silence into testimony) deepens accumulatively via timer chimes and negative reveal, narrowing to agency in sealing envelope; felt cost in hand cramp and inheritance charges ending, but abstract censorship mutes visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Scars-as-cartography emerges organically from hands/negative to final envelope seal reweighting censorship as passing weather without moralizing; resonant reconfiguration of pause as incubation lingers via charged particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in photographic diction ("wet emulsion," "developing print") modulates rhythm under pressure; no elision or head-hopping obscures closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (chemical darkness, emulsion) propels via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting density in writing beat ("furiously tranquil" reprise, "rarefied" echoes) slightly dulls propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photographic darkroom motifs with censorship vigil transforms into scars-map premise, risking lyric accumulation that inevitably charges CR ending; no derivative echoes.</comment>
