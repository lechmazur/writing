<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in discoveries versus elder reaction, earning final renunciation of rebellion; interiority concrete and embodied, peaking in "nerves singing with newfound sensation" without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from bolt to sheet music tightening stake; CR closure legible in "placed the bolt back...sealing the secret" with conceptual cost of chosen silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow pressing arrow slits and frost-rimed carpets constrain isolation, charging final image; cobalt walls and staircase discoloration filter through POV urgency, mirroring thawing internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand safety's cost signaled early, deepens accumulatively via elders' horror/pity narrowing to voluntary silence; agency in sealing bolt forecloses speech with felt patient cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of safety's erasure versus chosen connection emerges organically from particulars; final "frostbitten hope warming his chest" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in frost/cobalt diction; rhythmic modulation builds pressure, gestures natural/subtextual in refectory without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative texture taught early (e.g., "iron had wept"); no loops or scaffolds, propulsion clean to closure despite occasional purple density in descriptives.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Hush/music ban in fortress transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in lyric voice heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in voluntary silence premise.</comment>
