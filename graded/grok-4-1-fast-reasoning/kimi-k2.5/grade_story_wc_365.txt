<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied sensory mapping reveals contradictory impulses—redirect vs. endure—culminating in earned stasis at convergence where she honors the burden, with internalized shard as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragment density assembles truth via shard-wounds, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure: "She stepped back into her native reality," reconfiguring salvation with cost of permanent weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Repair bay and shard constrain choices (e.g., "eastern hangar door," bulkheads in five dimensions), charging final image where bay "transformed... inhabited by resonance" via sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (withheld truth) deepens through universe jumps under Accum lens, agency in refusal foreclosing redirection with legible cost: internalized shard as "necessary pressure."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of burdens as coordinates emerges organically from mappings to final non-literal resonance: "She had become the map," reweighting mercy's complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory-biased perceptual signature ("ghost vibrations," tastes of copper) sustains stable single POV with rhythmic control, modulating for cyclical intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor patterned repetition ("cyclically spontaneous") borders loop without obscuring closure; overwrought metaphors purposeful in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory cartography and parallels transforms multiverse trope, with nonlinear risks heightening stakes to inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
