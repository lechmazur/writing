<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's balanced traits drive precise micro-choices like inscribing equations and speaking the name, with embodied regret ("hands moved with the precision of regret made luminous") revealing internal conflict. Final repair earns her change via prior causality. Contradictory impulses surface in honoring fracture over reversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from coin inscription through night work to Kael's golden-scarred return as RR with conceptual cost (fracture honored, not erased). Orientation anchored early ("cooling crucibles... collapsed roof"). Closure image ("rainwater evaporate from his golden scars") reconfigures premise legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rain-washed foundry integrates tactilely (drips chiming, steam, ash washing), constraining work (rain intensifies, cleanses slate) and charging closure (evaporates from scars). Sensory hierarchy alchemical (phosphorescent equations, molten gold). Micro-setting (anvil, coin) shapes choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem Kael) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening (calculating name-weight to speaking it), narrowing options with agency-cost (pushing "tensile strength of causality"). Cost legible in scars pulsing as "evidence... through sufficient love and accurate mathematics."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (fracture as strength via science-love) emerges organically from kintsugi process, reweighted in final scars without statement. Resonance in "damage could be incorporated into strength," inviting ambiguity on repair's price. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with alchemical perceptual signature ("thermodynamics and theology merged"). Lyrical rhythm modulates (short precise gestures under stress). Minimal dialogue natural, subtextual ("You explored the limits").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied rhythm, strong verbs like "levitated, spinning"); figurative coherent (light bending, golden sap). Minor scaffold in adjacent regret phrases ("regret made luminous," "precise... logic of her love"), but pattern supports accumulative tone without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy as physics ("conservation of soul-mass") with kintsugi redemption transforms tropes; risk in "poetry" boundary taken boldly. Final reconfiguration ("not replaced") inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes.</comment>
