<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like sorting buttons to access wisdom, earn the shift from keeper to seamstress; minor unearned epiphany at "prophecy was not a sentence but a knot" slightly softens peak motivation without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in sand falling upward and cliffs resettling; prophecy-to-possibility reconfiguration legible with conceptual cost of inverting time's flow, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like amber dust spiral and humming buttons constrains prophecy unscrambling and charges final lantern image; cliffs pressure stakes throughout, POV-filtered perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert collapse) tightens accumulatively via button mandala to echo release, narrowing immutable prophecy into foldable time; agency in placing echo drives deepening with legible conceptual cost at upward sand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of foldable time emerges organically from buttons yearning to merge and echo dissolving prophecy, reweighting endings as "buttons that have not yet found holes" in resonant final image without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (time as fluid/resin, buttons as wisdom-seeds); rhythmic poetic diction modulates beautifully under rising density, elisions purposeful and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("shared wisdom," "quietly inspired") and dense metaphors throughout create slight overwriting drag pre-closure without obscuring shatter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh fabulist synthesis of hourglass turning, button wisdom, and echo harmonics transforms prophecy tropes boldly; button mandala into silence release feels inevitable and risks poetic extremity for heightened stakes.</comment>
