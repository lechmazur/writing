<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to navigate without moving drives stasis endurance with earned change to landmark; abstract interiority lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure, as in bird-watching revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern density to CR closure ("He would stand here...becoming himself a stone arrowhead"); cost legible in "dust buried him completely," constraint of stillness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain meditation and charge final hum; sensory filter (harmonic frequencies, dust settling) mirrors POV, with birds' patterns guiding revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraise arrowhead for liberation vs. anchor) deepens texturally via birds' patterns narrowing to stasis acceptance; agency in focused breath aligns frequencies with visible cost of immobility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as travel emerges organically from particulars (arrowhead trajectories, echo accumulation); final image ("silence was...the fullest possible sound") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (geological/harmonic bias); rhythmic modulation supports stasis pressure, diction controlled without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops ("centuries of layered dust" x3, "historically reverent" x2) slightly dull mid-section propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harmonic stasis, bone geology, and temporal navigation via arrowhead/birds; risk-taking in lyric compression heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
