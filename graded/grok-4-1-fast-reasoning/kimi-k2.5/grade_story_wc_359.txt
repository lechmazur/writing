<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority is vividly character-particular, rooting motivation in her training and condition; micro-choices like positioning under the aurora shaft reveal values under pressure. Earned change via collapse forecloses endurance path with physical cost. Minor slip: no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in peak striking beat, tilting toward competence without struggle compounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to global resonance; single scene anchors orientation by para 1. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands on-page with collapse cost legible in "she collapsed against the crystalline surface... warm with creation's afterglow." Sculptor's distant strike tightens as one meaningful causal linkage narrowing timing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora constrain choices (alcove bells, central spire positioning) and charge final image (ice preserves molecular memory). Sensory hierarchy via synesthesia filters selectively (lights as choral tastes, silence as violet weight). Details evolve causally with prism-shards and flooding colors mirroring internal awe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder pre-midnight) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via synesthetic density and chisel-sync tightening to global saturation. Agency in bell strikes forecloses failure with collapse cost. One deepening (sheet rearranges, dissolves) reweights Council's metric visibly; minor abstractness in bureaucratic threat vs. visceral on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's measurability emerges organically from prism-song's data saturation of Council screens, avoiding statement. Final image (breath misting in charged stillness) offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting stillness as infinite possibility. Particulars like geometric shards interweave internal/external conflict without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (sounds as colors, lights as harmonies) biasing notice selectively. Voice texture modulates rhythmically from poised anticipation to climactic explosion, then poised afterglow. Purposeful lyric compression legible under accumulative lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative overload in climax ("prismatic geometry... stained glass thrown into slow motion") risks coherence with strained vehicles across peak beat. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor mixed-metaphor muddle ("negative space carved by intention rather than blade") dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic prism-song syncing global resonance via aurora transforms art-as-magic trope through grounded sensory physics and measurable awe. Risky conceptual synthesis (sculpted hush as stillness architecture) feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically (+0.3 for bold premise commitment).</comment>
