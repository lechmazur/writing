<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority through embodied perceptions like respirator pressure and pupil dilation under stress; micro-choices like clipping and placing the patch reveal obsessive competence. Earned realization at convergence point shows foresight motivation with felt cost of Chen's tragedy. Minor tidiness in epiphany lacks deeper contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure where final mapping reconfigures tragedy's geometry with conceptual cost in "hazy beautiful inevitability." Orientation anchored early at perimeter gate. Single scene causality intact, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Containers as baffles constrain navigation and wind survey, charging final image of spirals confirming calculations. Sensory hierarchy (anemometer velocities, crystallized residue) filtered through investigator's priorities. Hazy precision evolves causally with fog thickening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map disaster dynamics for foresight) signaled early, tightens via deepening realization of wind shear at convergence clearing. Agency in reverse-engineering forecloses ignorance with cost of Chen's death legible on-page. One decisive intensification suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisible forces amplifying tragedy emerges organically from wind-container interactions; final smile despite respirator offers resonant CR without moralizing. Patch reprise reweights courage's futility. Complexity in beautiful inevitability avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in meteorological precision ("twelve knots between Block C and D"). Rhythmic control modulates from survey tension to charged poise at end. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "boots crunching on crystallized residue" advances setting/action); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor "rapidly adapting" repetition not looped. No artifacts dull closure image of whispering currents.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of container maze as deadly meteorology transforms industrial disaster trope. Risky hazy-precision tone heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Final geometry mapping feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
