<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses in memory flood ("displacement of self") compel earned renunciation of solitude at gesture mirror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from boutonnière trigger to terminus revelation; CR closure in hand-raise reconfigures isolation with conceptual duty-cost legible in "loved the light more than the shore."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist and opal dock constrain investigation (gaps in spray/rust) and charge final image (fog "pressed against her skin like a question"); selective sensory hierarchy fits keeper bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) deepens via memory pulses narrowing options; endurance agency at pinning/raising forecloses escape with felt cost of eternal watch crystallized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Isolation reweighted as "vessel... layer upon layer of nautical twilights" emerges organically from gaps/memory particulars; final image offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with keeper-specific perceptual signature (negative space intuition); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged poise without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; figurative layering purposeful in peak reconstruction, no muddle or drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" ingeniously transforms intuition into method, synthesizing memory harvest with duty baton for fresh, inevitable closure; risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
