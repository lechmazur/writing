<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through embodied cues like "heavy in her chest" and micro-choices like offering the tickets, earning the relational shift; contradictory loyalty vs. transparency acts simultaneously. Julian applies relevant pressure via defensive posture and revelation. Minor epiphanic abstraction in "thaw mistrust with transparency" slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ticket discovery to forecourt reconfiguration, with Charged Poise closure in "We tell them tomorrow" and Mara's retained ticket as felt cost (foreclosed silence). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via Julian's intent reveal narrows mistrust. No lens ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (acoustic hush, dripping percussion) filters through Mara's priorities, constraining confrontation in forecourt shadows. Recurring lens and tickets charge final image ("heavy in her pocket"). Forecourt subtly mirrors internal thaw, evolving post-rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mistrust to transparency) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via admission and mutual decision, forcing trade-off (expose complicity). Agency in Mara's offering and nod; cost legible in pocketed lens and planned confession. Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transparency transforming shadows emerges organically from particulars (doodles clarified by lens, forecourt resonance); final image reconfigures without moralizing—"focus could change everything." Subtext in silences and gestures invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable Mara-limited POV with perceptual signature (resonant/acoustic bias); diction/rhythm modulates poetically yet legibly. Dialogue subtextual ("I wasn't trying to steal"), goal-driven, distinct (Julian's whisper vs. Mara's gesture). No head-hopping; elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful resonance motif, but figurative stacking ("cathedral of resonance where secrets had no mass") borders overwriting in forecourt peak, dulling propulsion slightly. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies, strong verbs propel. Clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic setting, doodle-maps, and lens as reflection tool transforms betrayal trope into protective intent reveal. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes organically; final ticket retention feels inevitable. No derivative echoes.</comment>
