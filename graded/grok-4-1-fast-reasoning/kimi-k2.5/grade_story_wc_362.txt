<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength in embodied emotion peaking at prism heating in palm, revealing mystic's steady purpose; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in frost sublimation and hush lifting; persistent prism constraint shapes revelation with felt personal cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and mist constrain timing via wind-ceased hush, charging final arbor song; sensory hierarchy reflects mystic priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to prove emotion absorption tightens texturally via frost shimmer to steam; agency in prism angling forecloses doubt with legible trembling cost, but micro-turn single.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory in objects emerges via frost dendrites as neural pathways, reweighting premise in final bare glass reflection; resonant without moralizing whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fractal language of frozen water"; rhythmic control modulates to charged poise in ending hush dissolution, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering in climax frost dendrites; minor overwriting density in high-pressure beat subtracts, but no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of science-magic via frost fractals and prism refraction transforms relic tropes; risk in lyric textural drive inevitable at emotional release.</comment>
