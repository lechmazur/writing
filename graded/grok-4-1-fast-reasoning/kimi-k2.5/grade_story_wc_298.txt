<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reckless idealist vividly embodied in gentle micro-choices like brushing child's jawbone amid refusal of warnings; contradictory impulses yield earned renunciation at binding, with visible cost in self-sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through deepening density of signs to CR closure; cost legible in roots binding Elias as "part of the orchard," reconfiguring barter premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots-through-bones constrain climax binding and charge final guardian image; selective sensory hierarchy (foxfire glow narrowing to sap pulse) mirrors interpretive urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (destiny barter for sister's voice) signaled early, escalates via density-tightening to tree offer; agency in whisper forces renunciation, unmistakable cost in silken-iron bonds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of untradeable destinies emerges organically from failed barter to shared acceptance; final image resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting premise via roots' stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (bones/roots as signs); rhythmic modulation from measured steps to shuddering pulse heightens dusky resolve without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload in peak binding beat ("roots inlayed...stories of every soul...bonds softer than silk and stronger than iron") risks coherence without breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard ingeniously synthesizes fate tropes into fresh bartered-destiny economy; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via root motifs.</comment>
