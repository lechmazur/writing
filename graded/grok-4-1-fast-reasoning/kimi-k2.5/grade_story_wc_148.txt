<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in bloodline and father's mistake intensifies through micro-choices like whispering to stones; contradictory impulses (simple facade vs cunning narrative) act in hovering scene. Final smile earns change without tidy epiphany. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: lighthouse exhales as Elias drifts to boat, reweighting inescapable premise with undiscovered bodies' conceptual cost ("no one would ever find the bodies"). Orientation anchored early in lighthouse 17; single-shard scope fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse precipice and reef constrain hover ("wind tore at his prison grays") and enable boat shadow; lattice as micro-setting charges descent. Sensory details (salt-crusted glass, myrrh dust) selective via narrative bias, evolving causally to starless dark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape before bodies found) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via timeframe pressure ("pressed against his ribs like a second heart"); hover agency forecloses prior paths with narrative cost legible in silent wolf cry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of narrative sustaining reality emerges organically from particulars like stones absorbing whispers; final image ("lighthouse seemed to exhale") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature biased to "narrative physics"; distinct poetic texture ("copperlight repose") modulates rhythmically under pressure, compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern ("rope of lies strong enough to climb"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops. Slight overwrite density in opening risks minor opacity but serves accumulative voice without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of narrative physics in inescapable lighthouse transformed via silent wolf heir; risk-taking in "convincing the air itself" feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
