<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation roots deeply in abandonment, driving micro-choices like refusing to cull files, crystallizing at the dust anomaly into fierce witness-bearing; embodied shift peaks in "her broken heart aching differently now," earning her arc without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust gradients and anomalies build density to CR closure: Maya's hope reconfigured via button-as-method, with conceptual cost of grief woven into "larger fabric"; orientation anchors immediately in file room, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dust patterns as micro-setting constrain discoveries and charge final image, filtering through Maya's historian lens ("geological strata"); tactile selectivity (tracing finger, circular clearing) mirrors internal states purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solace in unknown lives) signaled early tightens accumulatively via anomaly to index-compiling agency, foreclosing culling path; cost legible in examined hope "not naive," but minor abstractness in duty friction slightly mutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unwitnessed mercy emerges organically from buttons/seeds, reweighting premise in CR final image ("method, a way of reading"); resonant non-literal answer via dust-preserved vigils avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (archaeological metaphors like "fossilized creases") modulates rhythm under discovery pressure; purposeful poetic compression legible, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm, integrating detail into action; minor figurative density ("manila monuments," "secret library") in opening risks overwrite but patterns purposefully without muddle or loops at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust-as-map to hidden buttons transforms foster archive trope into fresh synthesis of persistence/vigil; risk-taking in textural drive heightens stakes inevitably, no derivative echoes.</comment>
