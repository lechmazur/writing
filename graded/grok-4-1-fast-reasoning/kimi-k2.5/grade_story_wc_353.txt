<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices like tracing fissures reveal symphonically minded traits under pressure, earning the final weep; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from observation to bow strokes; Charged Poise closure lands on-page at "ground hummed—a subsonic whisper... into her bones" with legible emotional cost in tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tree wounds and insulator constrain choices as instrument/resonator, charging final hum; sensory details like frost-warmed spines and crazed glaze filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to pierce Hush tightens via analysis-to-strum cadence shift under Accum lens, agency in bow pressure; cost felt in embodied ache and tears, entering 8+ via trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trauma-to-music emerges organically via crack-sheet music motif shifting at tears on fissures; resonant non-literal answer reweights silence in final chord adjustment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with symphonic perceptual signature in "grain like sheet music"; rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to climax; minor paraphrase loops in crack descriptions ("fissures... stress cracks") subtract slightly but purposeful under textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent world, tree-as-sculpture, and insulator resonator feels inevitable; bold lyric risk in quiet hum heightens stakes organically.</comment>
