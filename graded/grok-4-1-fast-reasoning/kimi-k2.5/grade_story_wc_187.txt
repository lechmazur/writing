<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied nostalgia ("aching already for the moments") and micro-choices (inking skin) reveal contradictory impulses between private discovery and duty; final self-merging earned by shadow conjectures without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from measurements to whispers culminating in CR closure ("she was both archivist and archive"); cost legible in fluid self-loss at final image, orientation anchored by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quartz humming and storm-flashed shadows constrain measurements and charge final chorus image; sensory hierarchy (thunder resonance, bent shadows) reflects archivist's geometric bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcribe founders' last memories) signaled early, tightens via shadow anomaly narrowing to transformation realization; under Accumulative lens, deepening whispers force stance crystallization with merging cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fluid identity emerges implicitly from shadow encodings and skin-inking; final CR reweights premise non-literally ("self was not fixed, but fluid") with conceptual cost of archival merger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (geometry in shadows/emotions); rhythmic modulation peaks in hush-breath image, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked figures ("silver sea," "eternal waltz") slightly muddles peak hush beat without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-geometry and archivist self-merger transforms trope of isolation; shadow anomaly turn inevitable from world logic, bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
