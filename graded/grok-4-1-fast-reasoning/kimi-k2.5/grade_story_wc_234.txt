<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in vulnerability versus retreat intensifies via micro-choices like arranging tools from "crushed garnet, ash, and the ink of her own journal entries," earning the closure bottling. Contradictory impulses act in scene (calculated precision meets instinctive strokes). Final renunciation of absence feels compelled by Mira's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure: shell seals with "Presence-Dense, atomic number undefined, weight measured in the currency of courage," reweighting premise with conceptual cost legible in final pocketed vessel. Orientation anchored early at ember nexus. Single scene holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus's "thermal currents met the descending coolness of evening" constrains ritual as crucible, charging final image where palette etches "permanently into the geography." Sensory details selective via Elara's bias (pocket-suns warming thigh). Micro-object (shell) shapes choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture presence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mira's whisper triggering activation, narrowing to sealing with felt vulnerability cost. Agency in "directed spontaneity" strokes forecloses retreat. Minor abstractness in stakes fits lens but tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared moments gaining mass emerges via particulars like bottled secret, culminating in resonant CR: "certain configurations of atoms and affection could never truly dissipate," reweighting without moral. Subtext in shell's sigh avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("scientifically romantic instrumentation") stable in Elara's POV, modulating rhythm under ritual pressure. Mira's whisper dialogue natural/subtextual. Patterned diction taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload like "logarithmic spiral catching the failing light like a question mark made of mother-of-pearl" risks coherence in opening without obscuring closure. No loops; rhythm varies. Minor overwriting in descriptive beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical premise synthesizes science/romance organically, with Presence-Dense as inevitable CR from "pocket-sun" world logic. Bold lyric risks heighten stakes via vulnerability calculus.</comment>
