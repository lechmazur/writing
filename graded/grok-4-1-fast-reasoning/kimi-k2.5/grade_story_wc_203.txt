<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to treat ghosts as "another mechanical system" compels her engagement without flinching, earning the closure choice to install the barrel; contradictory impulses show in acknowledging the ghost's "weightless burden" while proceeding analytically. Interiority concrete via embodied observation of dust and scratches. Minor flaw: reflective summary late ("every building contains elevators") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of dust patterns to ghost coalescence to barrel installation; on-page RR (ceiling seals, ghost peaceful) with conceptual cost (boundary between worlds mended). Orientation anchored early in ticket office. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of drafts shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust spirals and plaster rosette constrain choices, charging final sealing image; sensory hierarchy (visual gradients, tactile verdigris, chill drop) reflects tech's priorities. Circus stubs and shaft integrate via action. Micro-setting (ladder, shaft) lived-in, evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover ceilings) signaled early, textural escalation via patterns to ghost to governor fit narrows options; agency in climbing/engaging/installing forecloses ghost's vigil with felt transfer of burden. One tightening sufficient; cost legible in shaft hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden infrastructures (ghosts, timepieces) emerges via particulars like tally scratches; final "mainspring of other people's unfinished hours" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in dust galaxies mirrors entropy vs. preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: mechanical lens on ghosts ("hidden infrastructure"); rhythmic control modulates from analytical to resonant ("helium balloon tugging"). Stable close third; ghost dialogue read via lip shapes natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density (dust "spirals like galaxies" does triple atmospheric/advancement duty); varied rhythm, no loops, clean syntax propel to hum. Minor: repeated "skillfully observant" jars slightly in peak but voice-tied; metaphors coherent, no muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghosts as repairable mechanisms in circus via mainspring/elevator governor; transforms hauntings tropes through dust physics and coiled tension. Risky mechanic-supernatural lens inevitable in hindsight; bold closure risks quiet resonance.</comment>
