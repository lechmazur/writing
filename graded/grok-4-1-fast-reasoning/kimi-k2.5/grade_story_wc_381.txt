<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to hush the prophecy roots in patient traits and intensifies through deepening concentration against writhing syllables, earning endurance. Interiority concrete in embodied acts like fingers tracing wing and chest blaze, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—more harmonious paradox than conflict. Micro-choices like releasing the wing reveal values with felt cost in racing heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence density builds from mapping hollows to expanding hush crushing prophecy, with cadence shift at wing's settlement creating Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchored early (brook, moonlight, summoner). Closure cost legible in "wing, now heavy with captured quiet and the weight of averted futures," foreclosing prophecy's path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (cricket song consumed, velvet shadow taste), filtered through summoner's priorities; brook and wing as micro-setting constrain choices (wing spins on surface, directs awareness). Details evolve causally (hush settles into soil). Recurring wing charges final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates via textural density: prophecy recoils as hush expands, narrowing options to equilibrium maintenance. Agency in mapping/release forces trade-off (concentration vs. chaos). Cost visible in steady blaze holding pressure and heavy wing; one decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxical stillness/power emerges organically from particulars like reverse ripples and silence's gravity, reweighting chaos into stasis. Final image (hush as seed in soil) offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in prophecy's code vs. negative space invites ambiguity; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (negative spaces, contours between heartbeats); voice modulates rhythmically, prose texture purposeful in lyric compression. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to summoner's cosmic mapping. Under stress, syntax tightens without loss of coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but overwriting in peak (prophecy fight): dense metaphors ("rivers of fate," "dark matter between stars") verge on muddle without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("smoothed hush" restates spread in adjacent lines). Rhythm varies, but template cadence in silence-building stems ("She..."); closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence as mappable geometry with origami compass transforms trope of averting doom into terrestrially cosmic paradox. Wing's starlight creases and hush's texture feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
