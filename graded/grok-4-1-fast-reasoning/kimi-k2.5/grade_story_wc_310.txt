<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "stellar doubt gnawing at her calculations" versus "contained fervor," driving micro-choices like scattering coins; final endurance of doubt as fossil feels earned. Minor label-speak in "quietly enthusiastic" slightly abstracts embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from prophecy parsing to alignment lock; on-page DC/RR in "ambered observatory did not shatter but unfolded" with conceptual cost of preserved doubt. Orientation anchored early in observatory deck post-contraction; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ambered console's "viscous temporal medium" constrains coin-reading choice and charges final unfolding image; selective sensory details like coins chiming integrate with action. Recurrent amber motif mirrors internal doubt without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alignment or eternal singularity) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening in static parsing and coin patterns narrowing options; agency in "final adjustment" forecloses failure path with felt doubt cost. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of doubt as "medium" for certainty emerges organically from coin warmth and alignment; final image reweights reversed causality with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing. Coins' reprise shifts from echoes to "valid currency," charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "geometric intuition" and cosmic diction; rhythm modulates from precise actions to fervent expansion. Voice texture distinct, no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in cosmic phrasing propels accumulatively, but paraphrase loops on "static bursts not interference" (repeated 3x across beats) dull mid-section momentum; minor metaphor density borders overwriting without harming closure clarity. Rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reverse-time prophecy, backward dice, and coin lots transforms Big Bang trope; risk in nonlinear causality pays off in inevitable-feeling closure. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
