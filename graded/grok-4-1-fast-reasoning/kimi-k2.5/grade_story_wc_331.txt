<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's memory intensifies through embodied actions like tracing the scarf's hem; interiority particular via geometric knowledge enabling the fold. Final reawakening earned by prior trajectory mapping, with sanely eccentric trait constraining isolation. No contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hyperbolic details builds to Charged Poise closure in pocket dimension reawakening, with conceptual cost of bridging analog/digital legible in "resonance between the fabric's preserved past and the story's potential future." Orientation anchored early; one continuous scene with fold transition coherent. Persistent geometry constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic shelves ("Pringles chips stacked in impossible towers") constrain entry and charge final image of stepping back through fold. Sensory details (frayed edges brushing call numbers) filtered through Elena's priorities, vivid and purposeful. Environment guides choices via expanding walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken dormant narrative) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via 3-year calculation to vibration in silk; cost felt in foreclosed digital haze vs physical memory. Protagonist agency drives entry and wrapping. Entry to 8.8+ gated by no further option-narrowing beyond density shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories in "impossible curvature between memory and matter" emerges from scarf's evolution and geometric pocket; final image reconfigures analog persistence without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like grandmother's voice in reawakened narrative. 9+ test met via non-literal answer charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in geometric metaphors ("parallel lines diverged"); rhythmic control modulates to quiet poise at end. Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (hyperbolic sustained), varied rhythm supports propulsion; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("comet's tail of physical memory") during entry slightly dulls peak clarity, pulling from 9+. Clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, analog scarf, and living stories transforms tropes into inevitable closure; bold premise follows implications fully. Risk in non-Euclidean navigation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on memory elevates.</comment>
