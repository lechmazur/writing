<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vey's contradictory impulses—nightly substitution for survival versus faltering glow pulling toward stone—earn the seeding choice with cost of coexisting pain. Mercury veins flickering and glass feet clicking embody grief concretely. Blind spot in fleeing memory drives inevitable confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: substitution falters via unauthorized glow (inciting), stone deciphering deepens comprehension, summit seeding delivers CR closure. Cost legible in "pain of memory coexist with the present, the sharp edges... carving space." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves in granite constrain navigation and ritual; summit starlight enables seeding pivot. Sensory hierarchy (ink-dust air, feather vanes) filters via seer's texture bias. Mountain evolves causally from maze to spiral sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape of home via substitution) signaled early tightens via stone's seeding message, narrowing to construct-vs-find. Agency in pressing feather to tattoo glyphs forecloses illusions; cost unmistakable in mountain shudder and memory pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glyphs seeding syntax reweights home from archaeologist to architect without moralizing. Final humming recognition offers non-literal answer to belonging question, emerging from feather-stone-bedrock particulars. Resonance inextricable from Vey's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: translating glyphs via feather rachis, mercury pooling grief. Rhythmic modulation from "low and threatening to shatter" to resonant dawn. Prose texture distinct in rippling skin, breathing dust.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action-imagery (quill from raven deciphers via vanes); varied rhythm propels without loops. No scaffold in peak seeding beat; "tattooing new coordinates into the bedrock" clear propulsion. Figuratives consistent, voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mercury-glass seer seeding glyphs into bookstore-mountain synthesizes fresh premise inevitably. Transforms home trope via comprehension talent and lost syntax. Risky lyric compression heightens belonging stakes coherently.</comment>
