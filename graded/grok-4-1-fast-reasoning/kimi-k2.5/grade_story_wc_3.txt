<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's kindly methodical trait and love for Arishti compel micro-choices like tracing the seed and reciting Sumerian, earning his self-dissolution as vessel. Interiority particular through cuneiform analogies avoids stock epiphanies. Minor diagnostic reflection in "haunted ambitions" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias disperses into aurora, reweighting translation premise with self-dissolution cost ("hunter willingly became the hunted"). Orientation anchors early in floating garden. Single scene causality intact, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's iron branches and graphite altar constrain seed activation via fields, charging final dispersal image. Sensory details (humming, auroras, ionized air) POV-filtered through translator's eye. Environment evolves causally with spores, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via seed warming/cracking to envelopment, narrowing to self-becoming-bridge. Agency in recitation forces trade-off cost (boundaries loosen). One tightening sufficient; cost legible in dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of death-as-translation emerges organically from particulars like clay-to-history analogies, resonating in final "cuneiform returning to the reed" without moralizing. Subtext in "touching distance collapsing into communion" reweights premise obliquely. No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: analogical diction ("cuneiform compressed meaning") biases noticing, modulating rhythmically to compressed peak ("boundaries began to loosen"). No head-hopping or withholding; voice fits scholarly focalizer under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; metaphors coherent (seed as tablet). Minor paraphrase loops in "analogical thinking" repeats slightly dull two mid-beats, but purposeful pattern pays off. No scaffold or artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stratospheric biotech garden, obsidian cuneiform seed, and consciousness physics transforms ghost-chase trope via translator's arc. Risky CR closure ("became the word") inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes; bold altitude/levitation commitment heightens stakes.</comment>
