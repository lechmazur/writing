<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority poetic and sensory-embodied (sternum vibrations, trembling fingers) but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; realizations feel summative rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure (spiral-time realization reconfigures homesickness); orientation anchored early, one tightening via ice crack initiates symphony without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass spire and frozen lake vividly constrain mapping and amplify resonances, charging final prismatic image; sensory hierarchy (creaks, breath clouds) reflects Elias's perceptual bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesickness vs. symphonic harmony) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shell-tracing and ice-crack deepening to foreclose isolation; cost legible in temporal vertigo endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of spiral time emerges organically from nautilus, mapping, and ice-song particulars; final conducting image offers resonant CR reweighting without moralizing, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (musical metaphors, spiral motifs); rhythmic modulation builds intensity, prose texture matches introspective stance without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "visible chords and melodies made manifest") borders overwriting without coherence loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writer mapping memories onto ice via nautilus transforms tropes of epiphany into tangible symphony; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure inevitability.</comment>
