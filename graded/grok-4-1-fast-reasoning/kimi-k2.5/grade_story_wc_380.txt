<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in years seeking deleted memories intensifies through embodied actions like trembling hands pouring coffee and urgent digging, earning the final chest-clutching realization. Interiority concrete and particular (intuition reading grounds as coordinates), with micro-choices revealing values under gravity's constraint. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fissure entry to coffee map to exhumation, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing (memories migrate via salt, whale's sacrifice) with felt cost in "nothing... routine again." Orientation anchored early (lantern lighter notices beached whale's fissure). Single continuous scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt crystals (ribcage formation, frozen lightning) and gravity pockets constrain choices (adjusts gait, careful scraping around delicate structures), charging closure via repository of absence. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (marrow vibration guides deeper). Environment evolves causally with her progress, mirroring revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover sister's memory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via coffee patterns narrowing to spires then box, forcing trade-off in urgent exhumation. Agency in divination and digging drives escalation; cost legible in warped crystals' ache and final changed routine. Enters 8+ via foreclosure but abstract until physical payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory migration (not destruction) emerges organically from whale-dirge guidance, coffee spirals, flower preservation, reweighting premise in final image without statement. Resonant CR answers "where deleted memories go" via particulars, lingering ambiguity in whale's intent. No moralizing; complexity in sacrifice's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (intuition syncing heart to subsonic dirge, electricity in arms). Prose texture modulates rhythm with intensity (weightless steps to frantic brushing). Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "poured the cold coffee... grounds swirling into configurations"); rhythm varies (short urgent sentences in digging). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak exhumation; read-aloud ear clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of salt-vault memories, whale sacrifice, coffee divination in fluctuating gravity transforms tropes organically. Risky conceptual physics (memory sedimentation) follows implications to CR without retreat, inevitable in hindsight via patterned particulars.</comment>
