<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to witness transformation is clear and rooted in loose grip on reality, shown through unfolding swan and writing in margins; interiority particular but declarative epiphanies like "tyranny of interpretation" border on diagnostic without embodied contradiction acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of decay images tightening to CR closure in folding swan amid dissolution threat ("threatens to return to pulp"), reweighting preservation as transformation with conceptual cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vivid and selective—vines, roots, river silt, obsidian vibration—mirrors internal decay and constrains observation; obsidian refuge and swan as micro-settings charge final image by absorbing silence and humidity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of judgment-free witnessing escalates via deepening burrow and regenerative silence filling lungs, forcing endurance with felt cost in dissolving boundaries; one decisive density intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of decomposition nourishing transformation emerges organically from silt accumulation and swan bleeding ink, resonant non-literal answer in hopeful dissolution without moralizing; final image reweights prior decay particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature of breathing stone and whispering books; rhythmic poetic diction modulates serene intensity, perceptual bias toward loose reality enhances lyric texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in sensory integration, but repetitive phrasing ("across the drift of untold seasons" x4, paraphrase loops on decay/transformation) creates template cadence dulling momentum without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist dissolving into archive via living map-swan transforms trope of lost knowledge into entropy hope; risk-taking in lyric catacomb journey heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
