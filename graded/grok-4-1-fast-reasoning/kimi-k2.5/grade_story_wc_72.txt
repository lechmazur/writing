<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corvin's interior doubt fractures into "prismatic doubt" post-revelation, compelling the ampoule's use; contradictory impulses (restore vs. nuance) act simultaneously in telepathic projection. Granite heart "accommodating the pressure of contradiction" earns final stasis with embodied cost. No safety-hedging; flaws like traitor/midwife complexity drive the midwife choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from silence to shuddering roots spiraling, culminating in CR where dome "breathed" and coral "singing in a key that contained both major and minor." Cost legible in "granite heart accommodating the pressure," foreclosing binary certainty. Orientation anchored immediately in hydrothermal current and dome; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fissure as structural weakness constrains entry and conduit, charging closure where purple smoke ribbons into vent. Sensory details (iron-tasted water, violet anemones on granite wrists) filter through Corvin's stone embodiment, mirroring internal petrification. Evolving: roots rigid to spiraling via causal propagation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (animate nuance vs. petrified certainty) signaled early, deepens via doubt to ampoule shatter; under accumulative lens, pattern break in roots' geometry narrows binary options. Agency in telepathic "cutting through sediment," cost felt in garden's shudder and Corvin's accommodated heart. One tightening sufficient, charges final polyculture image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mercy/judgment duality emerges via foxglove's "toxic and medicinal both," reweighted in closure's purple haze dissolving absolutes. Final image of "salt and sweet" singing offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Resonance from particulars: fissure as essential weakness, no false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: "incisively kind attention" biases noticing necrotic belief vs. living doubt. Poetic diction ("anemones that bloomed like violet bruises") modulates rhythmically with intensity, compressing under doubt. Voice as character: syntax reflects telepathic statue's nuanced mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "foxglove ampoule warmed against his stone skin" advances plot/embodiment); rhythm varies, no loops. Minor overwrite in repeated "cascading revelations" and stacked metaphors ("ribboned into the hydrothermal vent") slightly muddles peak density, but coherence holds at shatter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic statue threading architect's ambivalence via poison ampoule transforms drowned garden trope into nuance-as-fissure premise. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes in garden's dreaming consciousness; inevitable hindsight from early doubt to polyculture. No derivative echoes.</comment>
