<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between empirical austerity and emerging wonder, embodied in voice cracking as he speaks the sequence; micro-choices like burning three candles despite frugality compel the blood-sealing climax. Minor slip in summarizing irony early without full embodied cost until end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mappings and tile activation builds to CR closure where blood-mixing and palace shudder reweight his life's parsimony with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by twilight and ziggurat in opening lines; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian tile and palace geometry constrain mapping choices and charge final silver-mirror reflection; sensory details like candle-guttering wind and cedar scent filter through astronomer's priorities, evolving causally to hot tile sweat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of activating ancient geometry tightens via schematic revelations narrowing to voice-activated mechanism, escalating density under Accumulative lens to blood-cost agency at palm-press. Felt price unmistakable in "his blood mixed with the quicksilver."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hoarded belief as faith emerges organically from tile's proportions matching precession data, resonant CR in final smile "finally spending everything he had saved" reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in geometric noticing (e.g., "ratio of diagonal to side"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "obsidian that drank the candlelight and exhaled constellations"; varied rhythm propels to peak, minor figurative density in climax metaphors coherent and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Lo Shu magic square as stellar covenant in reimagined Babylonian palace transforms tropes via astronomer's irony; risk-taking in lyrical geometry payoff feels inevitable at star realignment.</comment>
