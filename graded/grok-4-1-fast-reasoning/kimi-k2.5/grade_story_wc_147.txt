<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in sister's loss and intensifies via embodied oxygen pressure and vision conflict; contradictory impulses peak in "training screamed against what she must do." Final surrender earned by prior micro-choices, with neural rewrite as felt cost; minor epiphanic phrasing ("honor the ephemeral") doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to vision-deepening, culminating in on-page Decisive Change (passage opens) with legible cost ("exhaling her precious air in a silver stream"). Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt, one tightening via vial vision suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater temple constrains choices (sealing cycle, pressure demands exhale); bioluminescent algae and preservation field charge final image of "lonesome splendor giving way to brighter waters." Sensory hierarchy narrows to immediacies under crisis; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape signal source before air ends) signaled early, tightens via vision reversal narrowing options to instinct override; agency in drinking/exhaling forecloses conservation path with visible cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, pressure crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral harnessing emerges organically from vial memories and surrender; final image ("caught the scent of ancient perfume") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting exploration's price without moralizing. Counter-readings in grief unsnarled add complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (sensory hush, weight of water); lyrical diction modulates with intensity, purposeful for textural lens. No head-hopping; minor register elevation fits mythic tone without clashing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density integrates action/atmosphere; motif repetition ("gathered hush") pattern-taught without loops. Minor figurative density in opening ("trapped star") fits without muddling peak exhale beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lost-temple trope via consciousness-perfume mechanic and exhale paradox; vial dissolve and signal transcendence feel inevitable from particulars. Risky instinct-override synthesis heightens stakes organically.</comment>
