<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to interpret silence roots consistently in her map-framing expertise, compelling higher-stakes choices like reopening the chamber. Interiority is concrete and particular, shown in her reverent hesitation before documenting. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in the peak chapel scene prevents higher score, as competence dominates without visible internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to CR closure in the torn map's final image, reweighting knowledge with conceptual cost of wonder's boundaries. Orientation anchors early via Elara's studio and Cornwall map. Video comparison tightens to site visit, with legible cost in non-disturbance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "limestone and decaying vellum" and dripping water integrate purposefully, constraining choices (e.g., clearing turf at henge). Chapel's acoustics charge final image, mirroring internal states. POV bias filters professionally; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover/preserve silence) signaled early, tightens via video deepening that narrows options to respectful entry. Agency in reopening forecloses full exploitation, with felt cost in leaving map torn. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence's power emerges organically from particulars like the deliberate tear and chapel acoustics, culminating in resonant CR: "completion sometimes requires acknowledging... empty spaces." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in boundaries of wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in tracing "intentions of cartographers long dead." Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically, e.g., shortening in chapel descent; purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sentences like "Water dripped... shielded openness" propel via image. Minor overwriting in reflective blocks (e.g., repeated silence motifs verge on loop) but pattern-taught and closure-clear. No scaffold or artifacts dull peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map restoration revealing encoded henge via video shadows transforms tropes of hidden secrets. Risky accumulative structure heightens ingenuity; final torn-map image feels inevitable from deliberate tear premise.</comment>
