<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (grief sharpened into "bleak exhilaration") compel the hunt's micro-choices, like pressing geode to console; motivation rooted in loss drives earned descent with time cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("unfiltered awakening") slightly abstracts peak realization without embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of calculations and countdown builds to CR closure where geode fractures and Amara vanishes into shaft, reweighting loss as "redirected" potential with legible time/geode cost. Orientation anchored early (surge 7 min ago, orbit); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode as micro-setting constrains choices (filters algorithms) and charges final image (data imprint, fracture); sensory details (quartz refractions, warming palm, breaker clicks) selectively mirror urgency and POV priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find reservoir) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via resolving equations narrowing to valley coords; agency in geode/console fusion forces trade-off with ticking breakers, cost felt in trembling fingers and final hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of death as "redirection" emerges organically from particulars (drone deviation, geode resonance); final image of "intangibly tangible weight of tomorrow" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting prior loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (equations as loss math); rhythmic control modulates from scrolling tablet to sharpened "point, a weapon made of grief," heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative lattice (geode matching perturbations); minor paraphrase loops ("unused potential pools," "intangibly tangible") in reflective beats dull momentum slightly, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum perturbations and grief transforms sci-fi tropes into inevitable hunt; risk-taking in CR closure (phantom futures as "vibrating strings") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
