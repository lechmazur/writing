<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory "nervously confident" impulses act in scene via trembling fingers yet steady transmission voice; final choice to broadcast earned by decoding causality with reputational cost. Meteorologist's whisper adds secondary pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as decoding density builds to CR closure in transmission and nail placement, reweighting exile premise with conceptual cost of restored truth amid persistent chaos; orientation anchored early in station and shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fungal growth and dripping constrain tower climb and charge final nail gleam under emergency lights; sensory hierarchy (rust taste, bioluminescent mold) reflects Elara's priorities, mirroring internal vindication against environmental dread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vindication signaled early tightens via exact weather parallels in decoding, forcing transmission agency; cost legible in foreclosed "madwoman" narrative and howling jet stream persisting post-resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed foresight emerges organically from journals' iambic coordinates to nail's "gleamed dully" as resonant non-literal answer reweighting madness as sacrifice; no moralizing, ambiguity in ongoing spores lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "wet velvet" breaths and biased attention to meridians; brief dialogue natural, subtextual in meteorologist's whisper advancing realization without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory propulsion, but dense metaphors like "velvet blooms" border overwriting in opening without payoff variation, slightly dulling peak transcription rhythm; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic meteorology and reversible exile transforms prediction tropes via iambic coordinates predicting shift; risk in atmospheric voice heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at transmission.</comment>
