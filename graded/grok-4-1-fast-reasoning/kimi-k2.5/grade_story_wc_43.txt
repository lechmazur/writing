<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's decisively kind interventions, like seizing the vinyl shard without permission, reveal character-specific traits under pressure; Maya's embodied shift from clenched knuckles to pressing the shard gently shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final choice of acceptance earns change via prior causality, with cost in unhealed fractures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hymn density and sensory buildup (scent arrival, tempo increase) reconfigure estrangement into charged poise; closure RR/CR lands on-page with Mr. Hale's exhale coinciding with wind rattle, legible cost in broken beauty acknowledged. Orientation anchored early at Cloudhaven; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cloud hospice and altitude constrain (thin oxygen, rattling glass) and charge final drifting clouds image; recurring dust motes, ozone scent from below mirror internal shifts via POV-filtered sensory hierarchy, selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of flawless goodbye tightens accumulatively via scent breaching clouds and hymn escalation forcing stance crystallization; agency in Elena's tempo increase forecloses sanitized death with cost of raw fractures paid in Maya's final hold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness hymned into eternity emerges organically from vinyl shard's evolution and mundane details; final image of record as "ballast against the emptiness" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting fractures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalization through Elena yields perceptual signature in selective mundane hymns; rhythmic modulation (low thrumming to increased tempo) heightens pressure, diction purposeful and biased toward ordinary sacrality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "rain rising upward in defiance of gravity" advancing sensory texture without muddle; varied rhythm propels via read-aloud cadence matching pulsing stillness, zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud hospice, vinyl Coltrane shard, and "hymning the mundane" transforms deathbed reconciliation trope; risk in lyric density heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via scent-hymn interplay.</comment>
