<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in obsession, with micro-choices like matching stride to key's ticking showing competence balanced by struggle. Earned shift to "keeper" feels compelled by prior discoveries. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observation to ritual, culminating in CR closure ("sealed not as punishment but as preservation") with legible cost ("many more loops"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via loop-walking rupture reconfigures timeline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orrery and key constrain choices (rewind alignment) and charge final image (resumes motion). Sensory details like frost sigils and flickering ghosts filter through rune-scholar bias, mirroring internal loops. Vivid, purposeful integration avoids catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release shadows) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven ritual tightening options (resonance bridges fracture). Cost felt in ongoing purpose; aligns with accumulative deepening. No reversal overload needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation emerges organically from spoons' fold and shadow release, reweighted in final realization without statement. Resonant image (horizon noon pocket) answers premise non-literally. Complexity lingers in half-lit accommodation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (geometries, ticking resonance). Rhythmic diction modulates intensity; purposeful compression in ritual beats legible under lens. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors like "shadows peeling like wet skin" vivid without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion peaks in loop-walking. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to charged close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bent spoons, noon shadows, spacetime loops transforms catastrophe trope into preservation ingenuity. Risky circular structure heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight via rune logic.</comment>
