<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resilient positivity shown anchoring actions amid chaos, with micro-choices like radio tuning revealing values; earned shift to transient state via guiding passengers. Minor slip: internal conflict more declarative than simultaneously contradictory impulses acting in pivotal radio beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure in pocketed hourglass (dust) and shifted existence reconfigures options with conceptual cost of eternal transience; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density tightening to unified pulse. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one meaningful deepening via frequency synchronization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto's pulsing stars and crystalline walls constrain choices by revealing other ferries and supplying Fibonacci patterns for radio; hourglass as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory details (memories as sediment, harmonic static) purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to merge timelines signaled early, escalates via radio agency narrowing splintered realities (child's coalescence forces trade-off); cost legible in protagonist's fundamental shift charging final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as ripples emerges organically from pattern convergence, with final transient image offering non-literal reconfiguration of isolation premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like yellow coat amid gloom reweights prior divergences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward positive pattern-noticing (e.g., "perfect clarity"); rhythmic modulation heightens surreal pressure. Minimal dialogue natural and advancing (radio call splits octaves purposefully).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but figurative saturation ("liquefied into silver ripples," "unspooled like loose rope") in inciting beat nears overwriting without crisp early pattern cue (−0.3); no loops, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh ferryman-as-timeline-navigator premise transforms maritime tropes via quantum patterns; risk in sustained surrealism inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes through hourglass reprise (+0.3 risk bonus).</comment>
