<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in despair overridden by procedural discipline ("overriding her despair with procedural discipline"), earning final realization; interiority embodied and particular throughout, no epiphanies unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds to closure CR in final image of blank slide with conceptual cost (duty's meaning reweighted); anchored early, one tightening as Fading accelerates suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen library constrains via thermal inversion preserving archives, charges final image (ice and equations surround her); sensory hierarchy meticulous and POV-biased, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (measure fading vows) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via acceleration ("Fading accelerating... sampling rate in milliseconds"); agency in micro-choices forecloses path with flatline cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of witness as love emerges organically from particulars; final image ("holding the blank slide like a prayer") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting measurement's meaning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (reverent precision in noticing light/ice); rhythmic control modulates urgency, diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "increased the sampling rate, capturing... in milliseconds"); varied rhythm, no loops or muddle, figurative language pattern-taught and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photonic vows and frequency-measuring transforms post-apocalyptic preservation trope; conceptual integrity bold, inevitable hindsight from particulars like child's promise flatlining.</comment>
