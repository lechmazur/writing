<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in lifelong trade and pure intention compels ritual choices effectively; interiority concrete in trembling fingers and bone-shaking vibration. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with competence untroubled by blind spots or flaws complicating peak gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as resonance density builds to tether catching ("invisible cord drawing taut"), yielding on-page Resonant Reconfiguration; cost legible in chip's dissolution into eternal mechanism. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in chamber and ritual setup; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains via amplification and shuddering walls, charging final swelling music; sensory hierarchy (hum, ticks, harmonies) reflects tinker urgency. Cherrywood keystone as micro-setting guides ritual placement and payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (endless night if keystone falters) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via collective chorus pushing back midnight; agency in pure-hearted ritual forecloses deception path. Tightening at vibrations waking world mechanisms narrows to Charged Poise with felt tether cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honest rust/truth vs. sour lies emerges organically from covenant and chip test, reweighted in final rust "singing of the repairman who mended the world's invisible wound." Resonant non-literal closure without moralizing; ambiguity in endless dance lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with tinker-specific perceptual signature (mechanisms as lovers, copper shavings notes); rhythmic diction modulates from hum to swell without drift. Purposeful poetic compression taught early as tinkersong texture, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wound the brass key with trembling fingers, feeling the resonance chamber hum"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in climax metaphors (verdigris singing) risks coherence but pattern-consistent in music motif, no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rust covenant and time-stitching ritual transforms music box trope into inevitable world-anchor premise; risk-taking in abstract mending pays off at charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
