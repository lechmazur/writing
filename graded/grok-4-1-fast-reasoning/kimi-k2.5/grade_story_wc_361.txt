<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's jittery trait yields to patient pausing during archivist encounter, earned by pendant's vibration cueing internal shift from anxiety to steady wonder. Contradictory impulses act in scene via code of solitude vs. extended sharing. Final endurance of routine transformed carries visible cost of mentor's absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pendant vibration → silver shoot unfurling → ridgeway garden bloom as CR reconfigures routine into sacred myth. On-page closure with bioluminescent plants and Elias's transformed walk shows felt cost of prior haste foreclosed. Orientation anchored early; no shards or multi-POV violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurora's "spectral green glow" and "frozen soil" constrain impossible germination, charging final garden image. Sensory details (ionized air, phosphorescent flowers) filter through Elias's noticing bias, mirroring internal transformation. Micro-setting (pendant, ridgeway gravel) guides pausing choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver while seeding wonder) signaled early; escalation via sympathetic resonance deepens to garden under Accumulative lens, narrowing rushed courier path. Agency in extending encounters forecloses efficiency with cost of transformed self legible in "jittery no more."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder germinating from routine emerges via growth images shifting from seed to garden, reweighting mentor's absence without moralizing. Final image of tended garden offers non-literal answer to fade from memory to myth. Subtext in shared silence and tea carries emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "electric prickle of transformation" and selective noticing of shadows/aurora. Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose as character reflecting Elias's evolving steadiness. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pendant began to vibrate sympathetically" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor figurative density in opening aurora metaphors purposeful for textural lens, no loops or muddle touching closure. Elevated diction voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier myth-making via germinating resonance transforms trope organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes through impossible growth pattern, inevitable in hindsight via pendant/aurora logic. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
