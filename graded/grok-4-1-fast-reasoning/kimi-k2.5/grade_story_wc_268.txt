<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Titan's patient dignity compels sundering gesture with embodied cost—crown too heavy for his brow—earned by millennia of preparation; pretender's sneer reveals mercenary flaws under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rune assembles from ink messages into rotating sigil, causally unmasking pretender with legible cost in sloughing flesh and collapsing library; Accumulative/Textural lens holds to Charged Poise CR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marble corridors and "dust of ages" constrain revelation via hidden grimoires; collapsing columns to "dust fine as pollen" charges final image, mirroring internal truth erosion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten accumulatively from star alignment to rune contraction, titan agency in "sundering word" foreclosing pretender's path with visceral disguise-peeling cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense propulsion peaks at "sigil rotated slowly... flesh began to loosen," zero loops; metaphors cohere as acid-truth pattern without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ink pellet as time-acid synthesizing rune unmasking transforms guardian trope; "gracefully unpretentious" risks poetic mythos that inevitability heightens stakes.</comment>
