<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dry-witted muttering and subtly confident stride under cold pressure reveal particular traits; interiority concrete via phrasebook translation; discovery choice earned by methodical escalation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as condensation patterns and phrasebook build density to CR closure; punching coordinates reconfigures maps with conceptual cost legible in "every atlas printed henceforth"; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen lake constrains walk and halo mist charges discovery; outpost as sentinel mirrors internal confirmation in final image; sensory details (crackle, rust smell) filter through cartographer's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survey before thaw) signaled early, tightens via condensation method narrowing to center walk; agency in verification forecloses failure with transmission cost; lens-consistent deepening without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of geography-myth convergence emerges from particulars like phrasebook phrase and spiral pointing; final poised lake reweights "water remembers" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cartographic precision (fractal patterns, grid disdain); rhythmic control modulates from disdain to reverent poise; stable close third-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (condensation braille) propels to closure; varied rhythm avoids loops, though minor figurative density in mid-beats; clean syntax supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Condensation-as-braille method synthesizes science/myth ingeniously; dog-ear arrow transforms trope into causal guide; risk of lyric patterns heightens stakes organically.</comment>
