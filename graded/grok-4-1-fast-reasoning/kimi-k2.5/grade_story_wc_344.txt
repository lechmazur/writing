<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through journey to instinctive guidance at climax, rooted in grandmother's stories and village need. Interiority concrete in touch-attunement but leans epiphanic in "rhythm of repair was not in the forcing" realization without deep prior contradiction. Change from seeker to keeper earned with felt journey cost, though minor archetypal gloss limits peak individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (prophecy, vial) build density to cadence shift at gear assembly. Orientation anchored early ("frost-rimed door of the observatory library"). Closure as RR via final click and mirror vision of restored village, with conceptual cost of patience honored in "driftwood patience" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen library and hall of mirrors constrain choices (permafrost descent, rotating reflections teaching assembly) and charge final image (village in mirrors). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (tactile gears, taste of driftwood nostalgia). Details evolve causally (ice retreating as harmony restores).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn repair rhythm for village) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via prophecy guidance to uncap trigger and instinctive intervention. One tightening: vial release narrows to hands-on alignment with counter-rhythm pulse cost. Agency in guiding cog forecloses forcing path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient listening over force emerges organically from gear "wants" and mirrors' multiplied teaching, reweighting premise in final wisdom without statement. Returning driftwood image shifts from nostalgia to earned restoration. Resonant non-literal close in departing as "keeper of rhythms."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in tactile/celestial bias ("touch attuned to such celestial mechanisms"). Lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to humming melody under pressure. Compression purposeful, eliding climb transit to focus hall payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., vial uncap advances plot/atmosphere/emotion), varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor overwrite in stacked figures during assembly ("liquid silk, binding... luminous threads") dulls peak propulsion slightly. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith-celestial repair, infinite mirrors as time-labyrinth, vial lubricant triggering self-assembly transforms tropes. Risky lyric fantasy commits fully, with mirrors' "labyrinth of when" inflecting closure inevitability. No derivative echoes.</comment>
