<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's chronic curiosity manifests in contradictory impulses—decades as witness vs. final actor—culminating in earned choice to enter the ring with compass, foreclosing passivity with felt cost of disrupted ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds from pattern observations to causal climax: compass disrupts cycle, yielding DC as silver mist coalesces into Lila with ring's withering as undeniable cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse's shipwrecks and shattered dome constrain detection of Virgo constellation, mirroring internal migration and charging closure as mushrooms wither under fading stars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory recovery tightens accumulatively via pattern realization, forcing agency in ring entry that narrows options with visible cost of fungal decay and habit breakage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observation-to-action theme emerges organically from stellar-fungal particulars, resonant in final image of reunited sisters and withering ring reweighting preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with folklorist perceptual signature—patterns in brine, spores as stellar dust—modulates rhythmically under pressure to crisp closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion without loops or overwriting; "spores that glittered like stellar dust" exemplifies vivid, multi-job lines accelerating to climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of flooded orchard, inland shipwrecks as constellations, and memory-stealing fungi transforms fairy-ring trope, with bold pattern-driven closure feeling inevitable.</comment>
