<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Phantom's contradictory impulses—mournful clutching of cord amid eager pulling—earn final dissolution into wind, rooted in chaos-conductor traits that compel grief-maceration over mere haunting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as repeated pulls densify silence into pulp, culminating in RR closure where handle's silver-dust crumble reconfigures barrier with fading cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Echo chamber's obsidian walls weeping condensation and daughter's stalactite sobs constrain maceration choices, mirroring internal states and charging closure's laughter-cascade against tunnel ache.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Leaf-blower cord as grief-macerator in echo tunnel synthesizes afterlife originality, boldly risking surreal mechanics that heighten stakes through imperfection-required haunting.</comment>
