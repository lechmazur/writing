<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's diligently curious trait embodied in gasping realization and trembling hand sketching compels higher-stakes decoding; internal sociable isolation contradicts yet enables revelation, with final whisper earning closure's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (book, board, birds) tightens to CR closure; starlings' spiral mirroring hopscotch decisively deepens knowledge with isolation's felt cost legible in "sociable isolation complete."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dusty hopscotch board constrains decoding choice via brushing grime and charges final reconfiguration; airship's groaning hull and starling geometries filter through mapmaker's priorities, evolving causally into sighing bones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of charting discovery signaled early, escalates accumulatively via board revelation narrowing options; agency in furious sketching forces trade-off with sustained isolation, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns bridging isolation emerges organically from particulars; final empty-deck smile and airship sigh reweight solitude as revelation's resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with geometric perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation heightens immersion in "starlings wheeled outside in complex geometries," no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in multi-job lines; figurative density coherent via pattern motif but risks minor overwriting in opening beat's stacked metaphors like "fingers dancing... tired giant."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-cipher decoded via birds transforms isolation trope into inevitable geometric revelation; fresh synthesis of linguistics, nature, dust risks bold lyric structure heightening stakes organically.</comment>
