<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied meekness-to-strength arc via micro-choices like "unwavering line of her shoulders" under descent pressure; final transformation as "quiet architect" earned without epiphany dump. Internal contradiction shows in trembling fingers vs. precise strikes. Minor tell in "meek by nature" but actions dominate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to chamber convergence, closure as Resonant Reconfiguration in "silk dissolved into threads... shoots emerged" with felt cost of "sweat and burns." Orientation anchored early in orchard/planet/arch details. Single-shard scope perfect, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "gravity itself seemed negotiable" in shafts and "magnetic ore" history shaping descent risks; charges closure when arches "hum with restored... resonance." Sensory selectivity (violet shadows, azure glow) mirrors smith priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax resilience) tightens accumulatively via shaft navigation to arch groan signaling "moment... narrowing to a knife's edge"; agency in rhythmic strikes forecloses collapse path with on-page cost. One decisive deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bartered resilience emerges organically from particulars like silk barter and seed strikes; final "azure defiance" image non-literally reweights meekness-to-strength without moralizing. Resonance from planet's breath balancing prior ruin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "smith's precision" filtering shafts/strikes; lyrical rhythm modulates from twilight calm to heartbeat echoes under stress. Diction purposeful, no filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "mixing her forge-hammer with the silk's essence"; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor deduction for "deliberate" paraphrase loop (shadows, care, unfolding) dulling one beat, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blacksmith magic in magnetic orchard world; floating arches transform trope collapse into "bridges to what came next." Risky lyric accumulation pays off in hindsight inevitability.</comment>
