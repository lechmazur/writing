<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in frozen hand at hospital door recalled through present paralysis-breaking choice; final renunciation of silence earned via shard sacrifice and letter dissolution, with weeping cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of mangrove barriers, spirit songs, and lunar healing build to RR closure in vision; cost crystalized in "Time sighed, resumed its flow, and Elara wept," reconfiguring regret without past alteration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mangrove roots and moonlight constrain passage and enable healing wounds at pivotal deck step; condensation messages charge final bridge to vision, filtering through Elara's penitent perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reaching apology timeframe tightens via spirit corridor and shard activation, forcing trade-off of sacrifice; agency in offering shard forecloses silence with emotional cost in weeping release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence's warp emerges organically from letters' eddy and timeframe fold, reweighted non-literally by dissolving envelopes into dream-messages her younger self reads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "phosphorescent shadow" and "wet origami" stable in single POV, modulating rhythm with pressure to terse "She could not alter the past" at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like shard warming against heart cueing purpose; figurative density heavy but coherent in water/rain motif without muddle at closure vision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mediumship rules forbidding change but allowing witness via gargoyle shard and condensation syntax transforms regret trope into mangrove-folded timeframe.</comment>
