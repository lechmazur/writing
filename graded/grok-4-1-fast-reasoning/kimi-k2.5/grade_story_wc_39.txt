<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in hoarding versus releasing sounds act in the composition scene, embodied in "wept with a positively wistful joy that stung like honey," earning the shift from archivist to herald with visible cost of descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, music box discovery deepens density toward Charged Poise closure in labeling "For Her" jar with shaking hands; cost legible in foreclosed isolation as he clutches it descending dunes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jars and music box as micro-settings constrain preservation choices, charging final jar-as-lantern image; sensory details like "salt and ghosts" filter through Elias's sound-biased POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Music box tightens dominant stake of generational bridge, forcing sound-mingling agency that reweights hoarding with delivery cost; escalation coheres texturally without causal slips.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final harmony from imperfect fragments answers redemption-through-translation implicitly, reweighting memories via jarred lullaby without moralizing; resonance from particulars like warped "Für Elise."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound-perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm modulate from wistful ascent to resolute departure, sustaining clean single-POV distance; purposeful compression teaches textural lens early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but overwrought figures like "phonetic map" and repeated "lonesome splendor" slightly muddle peak composition without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound-jar premise and auditory redemption synthesize fresh angle on memory tropes, with textural risk heightening stakes in composition payoff.</comment>
