<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's muscle memory and embodied burden (sternum pressure, palms bitten) reveal character under stress, with micro-choices like buckle revision earning the final catch. Minor lack of contradictory impulses limits 9+; competence dominates without deep internal fracture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from waiting to speck sighting to snap, with Charged Poise closure in the buckle's warmth and "You saw the pattern." Orientation anchored early (Elara's perch post-static); cost legible in her anchoring harness readiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor's sway and rogue thermal constrain revisions, charging final catch; buckle as micro-setting recurs tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations through boots, soundless creaks) filters via pattern-seeker bias, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Kael's safe descent/trust) signaled early, tightens via freefall speck and thermal dodge; revision agency forecloses leap risk with felt burden cost. Escalation coherent accumulatively, reweighting options at platform edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Watcher's burden and patterns emerge organically via calculations to shared relief, final buckle warmth reweighting trust without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (midnight mathematics to snap) invites reflection on preserved faith.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (patterns in wear, velocity math); rhythmic modulation peaks in soundless heartbeat to exhale. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You saw the pattern"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; minor paraphrase loops ("radio static cleared," buckle checks) dull slightly without obscuring closure snap. No artifacts in peak (chute bloom to catch); rhythm breathes with tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arbor perch, pattern-seeking math, and buckle trust transforms sky-drop trope; risk in silent stratosphere heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
