<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobia's embodied surge—"throat tightened," "breath shallow," "screaming"—fuels contradictory descent impulses, earning shattering transformation in chamber step-in.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mounting revelations and phase density toward RR closure; Mara's gold-revealed paths and final envelopment deliver legible conceptual cost in "silence...resonate in her bones forever."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Facility's "ozone and stagnation," dripping pipes, and quantum flux corridors constrain descent choices and charge final image; sensory filter mirrors Mara's pressures without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake—free unremembered despite phobia—deepens accumulatively through flux passages narrowing options; agency peaks in chamber step with irreplaceable cost of personal shattering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Confinement-to-infinity theme emerges via phase shifts and researcher absorption, resonant in final "no confinement, only infinity compressed"; reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias for "invisible things" and rhythmic compression under stress; diction/texture distinct, modulating to charged poise at "claustrophobia peaked, then shattered."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image without loops or muddle; purposeful metaphors like "concrete barnacle" propel, varying rhythm supports descent acceleration to crisp closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cables-as-consciousness premise synthesizes quantum migration with phobia crucible originally; risk in flux navigation transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight via gold fleck's reprise.</comment>
