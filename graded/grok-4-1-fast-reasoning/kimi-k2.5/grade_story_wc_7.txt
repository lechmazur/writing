<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prune overload for growth is rooted in her tasting gift, with embodied interiority peaking in tasting soldier's kill "sharp and metallic in a stolen apple." Contradictory compassion in releasing memories earns her change, fulfilling 9+ test. Minor therapy-speak in "prefrontal cortex actively pruned" slightly distances embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to pruning pattern break, then seed growth as CR closure with cost legible in "difficult internal work" and shed "dendritic weight." Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored by first paragraph. No slips touch eclipse-peak reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains via "prepared earth" and girders becoming trellis, charging final vines/fruit image per 9+ test. Sensory hierarchy (taste thumb's rust, groan) POV-specific; decay mirrors internal pruning. Eclipse light evolution causal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prune mind/soil for seed) signaled early, escalates via memory surfacing/release under alignment pressure, narrowing to planting agency. Cadence shift at peak forecloses grief path with felt cost in phantom pains. One tightening sufficient under accum lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Neuroscience-as-gardening emerges organically from pruning to growth, final fruit image resonating as non-literal answer to creation-from-ruins without moralizing. Complexity in rebellion's subtlety invites reflection. 9+ test met via reweighting without thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with tasting perceptual signature stable in single POV; syntax modulates from descriptive to compressed peak ("Vines spiraled upward with impossible speed"). Rhythmic control heightens pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues. Per 9+ test, texture distinct under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "silver-gold light flooded... illuminating dust motes like stagnant time made visible"); rhythm varies for propulsion. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; minor repetition of "synaptic plasticity" purposeful. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, neural pruning, forbidden seed alchemy transforms dystopian tropes via specific neuro-gardening logic. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes to banquet rebellion. Bold, non-obvious premise fully committed.</comment>
