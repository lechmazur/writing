<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve ancient methods drives patient decoding with embodied cost in stiff joints; fisherman as silent witness applies subtle pressure. Interiority concrete via fulgurite hum and knot tracing, revealing character through micro-choices. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but endurance earns final embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of knot decoding builds to fulgurite flare and negative-space realization (CR) reconfiguring preservation. On-page cost legible in retied knot and stiff rise from cold. Orientation anchored immediately in dock/harbor/snow; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Snow compressing under knees and fog thickening constrain patience, charging final crunch under boots. Sensory hierarchy (hush, creak, groan) reflects Elias's focus; golden dock evolves from edge to floating void. Micro-setting (rope, fulgurite) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve storm-calming) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via warming glass and final figure-eight knot. Agency in coaxing forces embodiment over mere recording, with felt cost in lost eastern master's echo. Pressure coheres without reversal, but minor abstractness in "weavers' consciousness."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as embodiment emerges from knot negative space and retied seal, resonating in fog-lift/stars image without moralizing. Subtext in weavers' distributed trust reweights sharing as cycle. Final promise deepens without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (philosophical noticing of whispers/tension); voice lyrical, modulating rhythm in hush to flare. No dialogue to judge; compression purposeful in time dilation ("hours or minutes"). Diction biased to oceanic/archival lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short creaks amid long decoding); density high, sentences multi-job. Minor paraphrase loops ("infinitely patient" x2, fog rolling) and elevated diction ("primordial crafts") in peak but not obscuring flare closure. No filter stacks or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fulgurite lens decoding weavers' knots transforms folklore trope into tactile preservation. Risky lyric patience pays off in negative-space CR; no derivative echoes, voice commits to arcane ingenuity.</comment>
