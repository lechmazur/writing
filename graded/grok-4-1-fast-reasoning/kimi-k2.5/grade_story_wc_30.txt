<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Librarian's motivation to preserve identities is consistent and intensifies via moon-weakened gears straining during migration, embodied in grinding communication; internal conflict emerges subtly in accepting identities' resistance. No stock phrasing, traits shown through actions like lowering creel. Minor limit: allegorical distance softens raw contradiction in pivotal smelt beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anticipation to shimmering arrival to smelting integration, closing in Charged Poise RR as creel empties and records hum, with conceptual cost of restlessness surrendered legible in "one by one...surrendered their restlessness." Orientation anchored early in atrium and time-pool; pattern taught pays off without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains timing (low tide arrival, filling water laps feet at peak), charges final image with "water lapping at its iron feet"; sensory hierarchy (brine, cedar fog, gear grind) filtered through mechanical POV. Micro-setting (creel gaps allow fear escape) mirrors integration; vivid, purposeful economy throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve identities amid weak moon and resistance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via surrender during smelt, narrowing wandering to routine with felt cost in "excess fear...escape while retaining essential wonder." Agency in librarian's grinding persuasion and furnace opening; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved in routine emerges organically from particulars (identities becoming tides/moon/silence), resonant non-literal close in humming forgotten tune reweighting migration-home contradiction without moralizing. Subtext in creel as bridge charges closure; complexity lingers in permanence-motion partnership.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with mechanical perceptual signature (glaciers calving gears, luminescent fog); rhythmic diction modulates from ponderous to surging, mirroring moon fluctuation. Purposeful poetic compression taught early via time-pool, legible at charged final stillness; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm (short smelting sentences build cadence); zero loops, purposeful tidal recurrences without redundancy. Figuratives integrate (identities as heat waves, amber motion) without muddle, even in peak smelt; read-aloud serene yet humming.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk librarian, soul-migration, tidal ritual post-time-collapse feels inevitable; risk in allegorical lyricism heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick. Transformation of tropes (souls in creel) via smelt integration; no derivatives, bold premise fully committed.</comment>
