<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through textured perceptions of silence (e.g., "viscosity" of hushes); obsession earns final becoming-the-map endurance with embodied cost (gold leaf on skin). Contradictory impulses subtle in storm vs. methodology tension. No unearned epiphanies; flaws drive her blind persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cataloging to pebble self-arrangement to booklet emptying as CR closure, reweighting endless night as methodology with conceptual cost (certainties fall away). Orientation anchored immediately (oracle at parapet, fort in storm). Single scene fits defaults perfectly; cost legible in "gold leaf entirely gone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (cold grooves under feet, wind frequency through slits) filtered via obsession; setting constrains via pebbles' gravity-response patterns and flooded courtyard charging final image. Micro-objects (pebbles, booklet) evolve causally. No white-room; weather tensions but yields to hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping endless night) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening hushes to realization pebbles map without her; agency in retelling/arranging forces trade-off (booklet consumed). Cost unmistakable in self-transfer of gold and suspended preservation. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence as architecture emerges organically from particulars (hushes' textures, unsaid accumulations); final empty booklet reweights premise non-literally as "methodology requiring flaking... certainties to fall away." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in readable-only-to-initiates map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing absences' weights); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (whisper amid wind to settled poise). Diction purposeful, biased to silences; purposeful compression taught early via catalog pays off legibly. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "shedding memories like scales" advances texture); varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with scene; metaphors consistent (honey/flint viscosity) without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or drift; opening anchors, final line recharges pebbles motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope into silence-obsessed mapper; lyric accumulative risks heighten stakes via textural escalation to CR without gimmickry. Pebble self-arrangement turn inevitable from prior hush-density; bold non-causal premise transformed through specifics.</comment>
