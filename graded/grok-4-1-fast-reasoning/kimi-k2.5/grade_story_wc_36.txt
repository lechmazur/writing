<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vision of past hesitation embodies contradictory impulses of caution versus action; final correction earned through relived failure with conceptual cost of evolving guardianship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from markers/flute play to on-page rift-stitching RR; closure reconfiguration legible in range's sigh, cost in harvested penance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range's weighted silence constrains perception/play; driftwood markers as micro-setting guide ethereal paths, charging final restored image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of insight-harvest deepens via vision reversal under accumulative lens; agency in corrective melody forecloses hesitation path with relived cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of dynamic guardianship emerges implicitly from failure-to-restoration arc; final image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in sensory hush/ache; rhythmic diction modulates intensity, perceptual bias filters canyon/visions concretely.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but verbatim "arranging driftwood as directional markers" loops (4x) dull momentum without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-weaving and failure-pollen transforms tropes; risk in poetic topology/avalanche motifs heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
