<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through discoveries, compelling higher-stakes broadcast; interiority concrete in "weight of their sensed absence pressing against her chest," but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal decoding beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from patch to numbers to coordinates; CR closure lands on-page in broadcast forcing rescue, reweighting deletion premise with conceptual cost of exposed lie, though physical server rescue feels slightly elliptic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Digital archive vividly anchors via "flickering servers," "holographic interfaces," "quantum server core"; patch recurs constraining choices and charging final image before tablet glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover deleted files' fate) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through numerical trail decoding narrowing to confrontation; agency in following trail and broadcasting yields felt cost of terminated access.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of data transformation emerges organically from particulars like frayed patch in digital ether and ghost frequencies; final realization offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in digital liminality ("digital snow," "tangible ghost"); rhythmic prose modulates urgency, diction purposeful and consistent in lyrical texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "cascade of deleted photographs... fell like digital snow" slightly blurs peak trail-following beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archiving as space-mystery vault transforms tropes organically; numerical map in forgotten songs feels inevitable in hindsight, risking bold conceptual pivot without gimmickry.</comment>
