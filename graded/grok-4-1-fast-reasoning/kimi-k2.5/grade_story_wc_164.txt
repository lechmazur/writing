<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in gift drives consistent micro-choices like pressing seeds; interiority concrete via sea-foam hair and bone-seeping gloom, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in conjecture-to-realization pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density to CR closure; "crater glass grew hot...new ones might emerge" lands reconfiguration with felt cost of endless work, constraint of fading memory shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iridescent geode constrains via pulsed light shifting emotions and time dilation for work; charges final image of glass holding lost/potential, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting/understanding gaps tightens accumulatively via jagged absences to acceptance; agency in transliterating final seed forecloses completion with cost of "work would never end."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Missing pieces reweight premise via coral paths and erased footprints to resonant CR of necessary silences; final seed's question offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with oceanic/crystal perceptual signature modulates rhythm to pressure; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with motif recurrence (fades/gloom) purposeful for texture, not loop; minor paraphrase in repeated seed processing but propels without scaffold, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-harvest via bird seeds/geode transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
