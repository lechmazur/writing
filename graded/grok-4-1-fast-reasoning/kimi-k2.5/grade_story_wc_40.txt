<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in preservation amid transformation, embodied in crystal testing and final placement; interiority concrete via spore-syntax preference but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in crystal placement atop blooming dictionary; cost legible in acceptance of evolving grammars, reconfiguring preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shadowed library and crystal constrain choices (testing against spines) and charge final image; sensory details (mycelium cursive, dew percussion) selective via POV bias toward growth patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth vs. linguistic evolution) signaled early, tightens via realization of spore mutations; agency in placement forecloses static preservation with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of decay-as-new-alphabet emerges organically from lichen grammars and final moss-spelled words; resonant non-literal answer in placement reweights preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (growth as syntax); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to dawn-light cadence, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("suspended hush," "fractured sequences") dull two beats; figurative coherence strong, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh bio-linguistic premise transformed via spore semantics and crystal testimony; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
