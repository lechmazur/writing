<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Past failure as cracked mold anchors motivation with embodied grief, driving micro-choices like "technically gentle" reconfiguration; earned thaw at "ice in her heart finally melted" shows contradictory regret/purpose without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from scrap to rope to projection; Charged Poise closure lands on-page at names glowing on walls with fragility cost legible throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum and aurora constrain gentle handling and supply light for projection, charging final image; micro-setting of rope/pillar tactilely lived-in via rebraiding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve names escalates texturally via intensifying aurora and fragility pressure, narrowing to precise alignment; reconfiguration agency forecloses haste with on-page risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Forgiveness/preservation theme emerges organically from casting failure to light-names resonance, reweighting memory as reconfiguration without moralizing; final "eternal chord of return" non-literal payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with caster-specific perceptual bias ("art of creation through negation") stable in third-limited POV; rhythm modulates from precise work to revelatory poise under textural pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density purposeful for lyric build but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("circuit, conduit for the aurora's light"); rhythm propels to closure without loops obscuring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax-casting, organ scrap, and rope-projection transforms memory preservation into light-conduit ingenuity; risk of fragile archive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
