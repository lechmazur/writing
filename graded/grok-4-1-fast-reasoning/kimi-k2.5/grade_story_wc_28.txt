<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kael's steel arms handling the tessera with parental delicacy embodies the contradiction between crushing strength and compassionate precision, compelling the renaming choice with visible micro-cost in retrocognitive tightening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in visions to Charged Poise closure at "I rename you Cradle," reconfiguring the plaza's meaning with conceptual cost of unhealed endurance legible in the settling visions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone constrains the renaming act and charges the final geometry image, with vitrified sand and shattered sky selectively mirroring Kael's layered perception under retrocognitive pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rename against sanitization deepens via retrocognitive visions narrowing to "Cradle," driven by Kael's agency in fitting the tessera, with felt cost of bearing pain foreclosing erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of tessera in pocket offers resonant non-literal answer to mercy's tension—holding without healing—reweighting survival's premise through aberrant witnessing without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature layers past/present visions with rhythmic modulation peaking in the announcement's "warm coldness," maintaining clean single-POV distance through embodied retrocognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figures like "tesserae rising like blue birds," with zero loops and rhythm accelerating to closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire retrocognition and renaming as radical mercy transforms tropes into inevitable geometric prophecy, risking bold textural drive without gimmickry.</comment>
