<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (defying elders while honoring tradition via dream paths) act vividly in sewing beats; final endurance of defiance earned by bloodied fingers and plate's ink-drinking, foreclosing compliance path with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of nightly seams builds to resonant reconfiguration at heart chamber; closure's final stitch merges plate to stone with canyon's shuddering relief as undeniable conceptual cost, reweighting ruin-to-reverence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Red canyon labyrinth and sleepwalking paths constrain navigation and wound-sewing choices throughout; final amphitheater chamber and glowing seams charge closure image, with sensory details (silver needle, arterial red ink) selectively POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend canyon vs. forbidden precedents) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening of invisible fractures and bleeding fingers narrowing options; agency in precise stepping and final stitch forces trade-off with felt bodily cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of precedents as evolutions emerges organically from sewing defiance and path-weaving; final glowing seams and mist-filled depressions offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting tradition's prison without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (tide filigree matching hand veins, stone pulsing sorrow) biases noticing toward weaving metaphors; rhythmic syntax modulates with intensity, stable single POV enhances lyric intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyrical rhythm, but minor figurative density in peak sewing beats ("orchid solace threading heart") borders overwriting without obscuring; no loops, strong propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of wharf-weaving fantasy with metaphysical bridge-sewing feels inevitable and fresh; risk-taking in dream-path navigation and stone-threading transforms tropes, heightening stakes to reverence without gimmickry.</comment>
