<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in "fingers tracing the frayed canvas" and pistol left unused, earning endurance of pacifism against father's legacy; minor abstract telling like "she understood continuity now" slightly dilutes embodiment without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to Charged Poise CR in final image of "weaving chaos into compost, proving peace could grow even in shadows," reweighting wreckage with conceptual cost of endured transformation; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sandbag scraps and fractured dome constrain cultivation while charging closure ("engravings on the sandbag scraps"), with POV-filtered details like "morning light fractured... at precisely 6:47" mirroring perceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pacifist continuity tightens accumulatively via dome shudder testing endurance without flinch, foreclosing violence with felt cost in sheathed legacy; pressure coheres to charged final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wreckage-to-witness emerges organically from particulars, with resonant non-literal closure in "manifesto of quiet... that only the patient could read," reweighting violence into growth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("sandbags whispered different notes") and rhythmic control modulate beautifully under reflective pressure, stable close-3rd with purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid images without loops, purposeful repetition like "engraved quiet" pays off thematically; minor elevated diction fits voice, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of post-tower scraps into pacifist anchors transforms tropes, with fresh "engraved quiet" and ritual blade-sheathing risking bold lyricism that heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
