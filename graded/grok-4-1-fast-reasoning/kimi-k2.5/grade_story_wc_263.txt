<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to free creativity rooted in three-year block and grandmother's legacy drives micro-choices like tracking stars; embodied emotions peak in "physical ache" and "hollowed chest." Internal conflict surfaces in terror of emptiness versus surrender. Final stillness as earned renunciation forecloses action with felt cost, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via star-tracking beats (fifth, seventh, eighth) narrowing to stillness before aurora fades. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with conceptual cost in "exquisite terror of dissolution and rebirth." Orientation anchored early (Elara under archway at alignment); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and frost-heaved stones constrain path-tracing choices; brass sextant warms, handled tactilely across beats. Sensory details (breath clouding, violet stones, silver snow) selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal void. Final "clay under her nails and marble dust in her hair" charges closure image as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity before portal seals) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as chorus grows and motivation aches. Agency in tracking and surrender forecloses rush-option with cost (fading lights). Escalation reweights via star-density and voices under lens; minor abstractness in seal risk holds back 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming stardust emerges organically from tracking to surrender, reweighting block-as-cage premise. Final image of dust settling answers via non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in beauty-versus-terror contrast lingers with ambiguity; strong but not fully inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: cosmic-poetic diction ("sky bled color," "unwritten calendar") biased to dreamer's lens. Voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, compression purposeful in lyric mode. No dialogue; elision of backstory anchors to present cues like sextant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short star-beats building to expansive surrender; high density integrates image/action. Minor overwriting in repeated "unspoken words" and "shadowed rapture" (patterned but risks loop in mid-section), no closure harm. Clean syntax, specific verbs propel under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sextant-mapping falling stars reclaims creativity via aurora portal transforms artist-block trope organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final dust-return inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes; bold cosmic-personal fusion memorable.</comment>
