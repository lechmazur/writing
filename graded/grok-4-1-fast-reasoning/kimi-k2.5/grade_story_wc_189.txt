<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Characters deeply motivated by transitional stakes, with Maya's warmly observant trait enabling tangential choices that force narrator's endurance; internal conflict embodied in pause and micro-gestures like tracing wings. Final renunciation of immediate answer earned via prior circling, with cost in suspended silence. Minor slip in over-articulated realization ("conversation wasn't a barrier but a threshold") borders epiphanic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from question to charged poise closure; jade cicada handover reconfigures options with felt cost of potential "dissolves like sea-foam." Single scene anchors orientation early (grotto, stars by ~50 words). No causal breaks; micro-turn in her indirect response tightens legitimately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's limestone basin and starlit water constrain intimate negotiation, mirroring margins; cicada's emerald shadows charge final image as micro-setting. Sensory details (cool air, breathing grotto) filtered through POV urgency, selective and purposeful. Receding water evolves to pressure decision texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (winter stay) signaled early, escalates texturally via tangential deepening that narrows resolution to charged poise; handing cicada forecloses instant answer with relational cost. Agency in Maya's foresee metaphor and narrator's acceptance crystallizes stance. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in "texture of time" but cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transitions emerges organically from tide-pool/cicada particulars, reweighted in final image without statement; subtext in silence and foam dissolution offers resonant ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from marginal persistence question. No moralizing; counter-reading (evaporation as loss) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature (metaphorical noticing of edges/reflections); voice modulates rhythmically from observation to intimacy. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (evasion via cicada), distinct idioms. Minor register elevation in reflections but consistent under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., cicada traces action/theme); rhythm varies, propulsion matches pause's breath. Slight metaphor density in peak ("pulse with internal light") borders overwrite but pattern-taught. Minor paraphrase loop in "transition period" mentions dulls one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cicada/tide-pool metaphors transforms relationship trope into textured liminality; grotto-chronicler angle non-obvious. Risk in tangential drive pays off at charged closure. No derivative templates; particulars (jade translucency) irreplaceable.</comment>
