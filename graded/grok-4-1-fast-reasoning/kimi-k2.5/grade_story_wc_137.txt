<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic's blind spots drive inevitable mistake of dismissing tower's resonance, compounding via tile contact into earned vulnerability; final welcoming of child forecloses detached persona with felt cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "courageously kind determination" borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (wind, vibrations, whale songs) builds to visions and transcription as decisive tightening; Charged Poise closure in arranging cushions reconfigures skepticism with vulnerability cost legible in "courageously vulnerable" shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower's limestone bones conduct whale songs, constraining repair and transcription choices; final niches charge image of child’s wonder. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations in teeth over visuals) reflects POV urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skepticism vs. mystery stake signaled early, deepens via tile's visions narrowing options to redesign; agency in frantic transcription forecloses dismissal path. One tightening suffices under accumulative lens, but cost feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Empathy's geometry emerges implicitly from tile unlocking entangled memories to alcove designs; final child's face offers non-literal answer reweighting science-mystery divide without moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual signature (celestial calculations yielding to marrow-felt music); minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven in "Close your eyes" instruction. Rhythmic modulation heightens visions beat without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("falling stars," "emotional architecture") during visions slightly muddles peak; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure. Rhythm varies purposefully from frantic pencil to poised welcome.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magic square as empathy-mathematics synthesizer transforms skeptic trope via Sumerian-whale harmonics; tile mounting at apex risks bold conceptual leap heightening stakes organically. Non-obvious premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
