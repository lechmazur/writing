<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via chain's weight and rust evoking lost surface; contradictory grief/wonder impulses act in sighting demonstration. Final courage crystallization earned by months of prediction, foreclosing stasis with emotional cost of departure. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract motivation without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chain inspection to Vega convergence as Charged Poise closure, reconfiguring prison-to-passage with legible grief-cost in "grief and cosmic wonder." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Benthic city and dome pressure expansion via oxygen limits; chain link as micro-setting constrains sighting choice and charges final image. Sensory details (rust bloom, bioluminescent glow) selective via Mara's nautical bias. Final viewport whisper integrates setting evolution without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (starlight navigation for survival/expansion) signaled early, tightens via predicted Vega alignment narrowing vectors. Agency in calculation/demo forces trade-off (madness risk vs. starvation). Cost felt in "prison" realization, but abstract scale slightly mutes visceral punch at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of anchoring chaos emerges organically from chain's shift (hold fast to release key), reweighting gift/prison premise in final image without moralizing. Somber marvel tone layers ambiguity (terror/wonder). Protagonist arc inextricable from navigation-as-transcendence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: geometric/nautical bias in "edge defines the center." Rhythm modulates from descriptive to hushed reverence; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Prepare the expedition vessels"). No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating to alignment; high density in chain-sighting integrates action/atmosphere. Minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("rust bloom...old blood") risks density dip, but purposeful for lens; no loops or artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chain link as primitive tool for alien edge geometry transforms nautical trope into indispensable survival calculus. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens cosmic stakes; closure image inevitable from premise without retreat.</comment>
