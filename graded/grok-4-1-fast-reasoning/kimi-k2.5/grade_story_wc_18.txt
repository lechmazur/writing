<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's firmly grounded trait anchors the ritual effectively, shown through calloused fingers and steady hands holding the fragile vessel, earning the capture. Interiority concrete via breath synchronization and consciousness stretching into glass. Minor lack of contradictory impulses limits to strong but not exceptional; no safety-hedging flaws elevate consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sextant discovery to breath-fog-glass fusion, culminating in CR closure where dream curls "like smoke made solid" with conceptual cost of erased boundaries. Orientation anchored early in orchard. One tightening via fog contraction/expansion; pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ruined orchard fog and frost constrain ritual (drawn into glass lattice) and charge final image of spectral trees revealed. Sensory hierarchy via artisan's notice of fractal frost matching breath. Micro-setting sextant/for ge evolves causally; no white-room, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, tightens via synchronized breathing narrowing reverie-reality angle under textural lens. Agency in deliberate boundary erasure forecloses escape path. Cost legible in "dream...finally contained yet still moving"; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erased boundaries emerges organically from ritual events, reweighted in final image of orchard exhaling with maker. Resonant non-literal answer via glass-trapped landscape pulsing with shared breath. No moralizing; ambiguity in contained dream's movement lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with artisan perceptual signature (silica fingers tracing sextant, frost fractals). Rhythmic prose modulates with breath cadence; diction purposeful in elevated fantasy register. No elision issues; voice reflects grounded consciousness dissolving into molten glass.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring breath (inhale contracts, exhale expands). Purposeful figurative density ("smoke made architecture") taught early without muddle in peak ritual. Minor boundary repetition pattern-driven, not loop; read-aloud rhythm strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblowing ritual fusing sextant for dream-trap transforms tropes organically. Risky poetic texture heightens ethereal stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration of broken instrument into frame feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
