<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's trembling hands yet playing reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; bleeding fingers persisting to the end earn her endurance with visible cost. Modestly fearless trait shown through absorbing pain without flinching. Ghosts as secondary pressure force micro-choices like blood offering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dissonant notes build density of ghosts and confessions to laughter release as Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure charged by "gorge filled with...laughter" and Elara's heavy heart/healing proof. One tightening from single ghost to dozens; orientation anchored immediately at gorge lip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo Gorge constrains via sound-bouncing amplification that weaves laughter tapestry; warped harp as micro-setting tool limits play but pierces veil. Sensory violet sunrise hush narrows to "dissonant chord bouncing...peel[ing] back reality." Final echoes evolve causally with release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of soul release via laughter signaled early, tightens accumulatively as "other spirits pressed closer, hungry"; protagonist agency in blood offering forecloses pain path. Cost unmistakable in stinging hands and heavy heart charging descent image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of laughter-healing emerges from ghost's "trapped...bird" confession to amplified giggle "knitting...essence," reweighting sorrow. Final tooth as "vessel of liberation" offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased to spectral "luminous ache"; voice modulates rhythm from hush to crystalline laughter. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual: "Only the broken music could reach your broken silence."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm accelerating to "full-throated laugh that echoed...clarity"; no loops or scaffolds. Purposeful lyric metaphors like "smoke" and "tapestry" taught early, coherent without muddle in peak release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of warped harp/tooth catalyzing laughter-liberation transforms ghost tropes organically. Risky lyric fantasy premise commits fully, with "wrongness...peel[ing] back" notes enabling inevitable soul rise. Tooth's final "metronome...redemption" feels hindsight-earned.</comment>
