<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "the old doubt creeping in...fear that she was merely varnishing ruin," acting simultaneously with resolve to earn final transformation into "uncertain no longer"; interiority particular and embodied throughout submersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density and sinking pressure culminate in CR—statue awakens via repaired narrative—with cost in "platform plunged...diving into the story she had made"; orientation anchored early in workshop/acid sea.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sinking pontoons and memory-tank viscosity constrain repair choices, charging final image of "corrosive tide rose around her ankles"; sensory hierarchy narrows to acid hiss and gold threads under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of narrative repair tightens via workshop shudders forcing "moved faster," reweighting to Charged Poise in reverent dive; agency in narration forecloses doubt with legible physical cost of immersion/exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges implicitly from gold-sutured craters to resonant answer in "whole not despite its cracks but because of them," reweighting brokenness without moralizing; counter-reading of varnish fear adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases to alchemical imagery like "bubbles rising silver," modulating rhythm with pressure; stable close-third POV with purposeful compression teaches pattern paid in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor figurative density in repair ("quilting...thread through like liquid light") risks overwrought layering without obscuring statue's awakening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrative-kintsugi on acid-sea platform synthesizes alchemy and repair into fresh, inevitable premise; risk in lyric immersion heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
