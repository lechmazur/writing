<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via refusal of binary paths, earned by prior causality in rope-laying and scraping; final sideways step into paradox shows hierarchy of values with visible cost of unresolved liminality. Interiority concrete and particular through tactile perceptions like clay under nails ancient/newborn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via image layers culminating in CR closure: poet touches time's "rough, inconsistent... incomplete" surface, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of embraced paradox legible in final sitting/speaking image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto constrains choices via backward/accelerating paths and charges final image through shards/rope/breathing rhythm; sensory details like radiating heat and shimmering air filter through poet's textural bias, evolving causally with beings' dance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of time-texture discovery tightens via rope's autonomous snaking, forcing stance crystallization in sideways paradox embrace; cost unmistakable in foreclosed binary options, charged by dissonant beings' frequencies aching teeth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's frayed incompleteness emerges organically from particulars like rope's stressed holding and fossil drafts; final image of verses in multiple tenses offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting moral ambiguity without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in texture-obsessed noticing (e.g., "press his palms against moments"); rhythmic control modulates from wandering reflection to charged poise, stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm mirroring emotional cadence; no loops/artifacts, figurative language consistent and pattern-taught (fraying motifs payoff at closure) without muddle in peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of causality-altering beings and poet's sideways ethic transforms tropes; risk-taking in paradox-choice heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via rope's prison-history-to-question arc.</comment>
