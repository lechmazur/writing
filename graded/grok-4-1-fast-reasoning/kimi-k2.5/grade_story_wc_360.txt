<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's predatory flaw shines in feeding the cartographer's journal to the halo, earning her triumph with his permanent loss as a font; cartographer's rigidity fractures convincingly under pressure. Minor slip: his drowning feels swift without one more micro-resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure where halo's "cold, precise light" reweights her quest with conceptual cost of isolation and theft; orientation anchored early, tightening via flooding empathy narrows options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Halo fragment as micro-setting constrains choices (fed journal) and charges final glow; topaz walls pulsing and vanishing stars via skylight evolve to mirror disorientation, filtering all through Elara's ink-stained tactility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify emotion via disorientation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as transposed empathy drowns cartographer, forcing her equation with visible cost of his erasure into a font.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's unquantifiable theft emerges implicitly from fonts-as-souls and final "hollow echo of stars," reweighting quantification as dehumanizing loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of "mathematics of emotion"; rhythmic modulation peaks in viscous ink flood, "Sit" command carries subtextual menace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via image-charged syntax like "gaps... missing teeth"; figurative printing motifs cohere without muddle, varied rhythm breathes with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Letterpress souls and halo transpose stellar grief into emotional calculus, risking bold lyric synthesis where stars' absence echoes personality theft inevitably.</comment>
