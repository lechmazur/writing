<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in theft's burden and precise gift compel the sculpting choice at the tower apex, earned through accumulating ripples; interiority particular via illustrator's eye on iridescence and temporal debt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final sketch and giant stirring early—"its nap ending three minutes early"—with legible conceptual cost; one tightening at forked spires.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and towers constrain navigation and gate access, charging final vertical waves and draining waterfalls; recurring pendant and vellum integrate via tactile handling, mirroring internal theft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to document echo's birth escalates via theft's stuttering ripples narrowing options; agency in pendant-sculpting forces trade-off, cost unmistakable as giant stirs prematurely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformative theft emerges organically from borrowed snores into bridge and enriched key; final inert pendant and residue-mixed pigment reweight premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with illustrator's perceptual signature in "capturing the iridescence" and syntactic rhythm modulating to desperate strokes; voice texture purposeful for lyric world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated figures like "water flowed upward into the copper sky"; no loops or muddle in peak uncaging beat, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of nap-time physics, time-sculpting, and echo womb feels inevitable; bold premise commits fully, transforming tropes via illustrator's gaze and debt symmetry.</comment>
