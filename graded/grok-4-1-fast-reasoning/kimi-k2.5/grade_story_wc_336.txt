<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve wonder drives all micro-choices like tracing sigils and dancing back from gray tendrils; embodied in weathered hands and exhaustion. Minimal contradictory impulses shown simultaneously weaken internal conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as essence density builds to sapling eruption (DC/RR); closure cost legible in "exhausted but content" after planting. Orientation anchored immediately on parapet; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall spray supplies capturable essence and threshold for roots, constraining ritual and charging final tree image; sensory hierarchy reflects pruner's priorities in pollen, mist, hues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of wonder's preservation tightens accumulatively via gray tendrils' reach forcing defensive patterns; agency in capturing essences forecloses rest with exhaustion cost in final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rainbow-touched sapling as living archive reconfigures fading wonder premise without moralizing; theme emerges organically from essence capture and bridge-nurturing, lingering in glade cathedral image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature for colors/essences stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation sustains hush under pressure, as in translucent body weave.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via image density, but figurative overload in climax ("oil-slick rainbows," stacked hues) strains coherence without payoff, docking high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh pruning-as-magic synthesis transforms world-weaving trope; essence capture into seed feels inevitable, risking lyric boldness that heights closure without gimmick.</comment>
