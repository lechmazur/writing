<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to prove whispers over shouts roots consistently in 17 years of work, shown through micro-choices like teaching footstep rhythms and marking maps. Interiority emerges concretely via pattern-reading but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final endurance of the network forecloses detection risk with felt cost in the storm's amplification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (footsteps, maps, coin) builds to CR closure where "proof isn't in the speaking... it's in the hearing" reweights whispers' dominance with conceptual cost of shouts' failure. Orientation anchors early (Kael tracing map amid storm). Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Labyrinth of containers constrains via magnetic resistance on coin and hides whispers; auroras/geomagnetic storm charge final image contrasting dying loudspeakers. Sensory details (dragging boot, phosphorescent paint) filter through Kael's professional ear, vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through passage to chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers via network success) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as density tightens with Voss's arrival and map-marking, narrowing to young worker's dispatch under detection risk. Agency in coin-use and rhythm-teaching forecloses shouting path; cost felt in "every shout a beacon." One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of subtlety over noise emerges organically from footstep IDs, whisper network, and final auroras vs. sputtered loudspeaker reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in "calculated spontaneity" patterns invites ambiguity on visibility's cost. Resonance ties to Kael's arc, non-literal answer in continuing whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with Kael's perceptual signature (reading gaits "like sheet music") biases details idiomatically. Dialogue subtextual ("There is no lock... only recognition") pursues goals, distinct voices (Voss's low subvocal). Rhythmic control modulates tension, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "zodiac coin... clicked home" advances plot/character/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors purposeful ("signature in wet cement"). Propulsion peaks in final image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: footstep Morse code in container maze transforms whisper network trope via zodiac coin's "recognition" logic. Risky poetic texture (auroras "dancing where satellites once hummed") heightens stakes organically. Final CR feels inevitable from patterns.</comment>
