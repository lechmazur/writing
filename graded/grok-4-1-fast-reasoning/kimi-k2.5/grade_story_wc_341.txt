<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via cloud-emotion taxonomy driving knot-tying micro-choices; embodied contradictions in tracing telescope amid grief; earned acceptance renunciation forecloses return-to-earth path with isolation cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("cataloging the empty spaces") borders unearned but anchors to present sensations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations/knots builds to CR closure in log entry ("The void remembers") with conceptual cost of severed wholeness reweighted as revelation; orientation anchored in first paragraph; single continuous scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gondola, twine, telescope constrain isolation choices and charge final knotted-spool image; sensory hierarchy (visual clouds, tactile patina/frayed fibers) reflects meteorologist bias; purposeful selection integrates into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove empty spaces remember) signaled early, tightens via knot-tying agency deepening realizations; density reweights isolation from terror to acceptance under Accumulative lens, with felt cost in "explosive grief" mirroring her nature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empty-space memory emerges organically via knots/clouds shifting from absence to potential; final image (knotted twine clutched like rosary) offers non-literal resonant answer; log entry borders thematic echo but dramatized through prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic cloud categorizations; rhythmic syntax modulates reflective intensity; purposeful compression legible, eliding rescue voices to crystallize internal poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frayed where it had snapped, the fibers splayed like nerve endings"); minor paraphrase loops ("spooled wholeness" thrice, unspooling repeated) dull reflection slightly but no closure touch; varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorologist taxonomy + knotted tether transforms isolation trope into CR on atmospheric memory; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via emotional-cloud mapping without gimmickry.</comment>
