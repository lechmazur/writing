<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to process accumulated remorse is embodied in her gloved isolation and bare-handed submersion; contradictory grief layers credibly without therapy-speak. Interior conflict peaks when she kneads coral like dough, her contagion turning poison to consommé. Final change—steady hands, gloves discarded—earned by causal submersion with bodily cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tidal pools anchor orientation early, density builds to pavilion entry. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page in emergence, reconfiguring her with pavilion emptied and salt stains as conceptual cost. No disorientation; pattern pays off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal pools and mud constrain digging choice; coral/ice charges final emptied image. Sensory hierarchy (taste of shame, squelching boots) reflects chef's palate bias. Desert evolves causally from wet to dry, mirroring internal smoothing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (process remorse) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via touch and kneading that narrows to total subsumption. Agency in glove removal forecloses isolation path with bodily cost legible in "ice entered her veins." Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief alchemy emerges via tasting/cooking particulars, not statement; final "smooth, rounded flavor of forgiveness" reweights premise without moral. Subtext in contagion paradox enriches without binaries. Resonance from coral kneading to dune recovery image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature: flavor topography, memory as topography. Voice texture modulates poetically yet precisely, syntax rhythmic under stress (e.g., "boundary...dissolved"). No head-hopping; elision purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery without loops; rhythm varies (short peak sentences in submersion). Minor figurative density ("sandpaper rough memories") purposeful, no muddle in climax. Slight scaffold in adjacent mud/fortress descriptors nudges from 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthetic chef, contagious grief, coral-ice paradox feels inevitable; "cooking the grief itself" transforms tropes boldly. Risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick, closure charged uniquely.</comment>
