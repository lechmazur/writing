<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular through scribe's precision (fingers trained to wind mainsprings) and embodied grief (knees aching, heart light); contradictory impulses in rehearsed speeches vs stone's indifference earn the renunciation at placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via sensory density building to RR closure: placing metronome reconfigures surrender with cost legible in "ghost tempo haunting her careful, clockwork existence" transformed to peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz pavers and evaporating rain pools constrain deliberate steps and charge final image (crystals vibrate, singing without sound); sensory hierarchy (petrichor unlocking conservatory memory) filters through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace with dream) tightens via agency in not winding metronome, letting crystals claim it; deepening reweights with felt cost of "surrender" foreclosing pianist path, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of setting down dreams emerges organically from particulars; final image (quartz/brass harmonics) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting abandonment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in time/music metaphors (spectral scales, ghost tempo); rhythmic control modulates hush to softening, heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful motif repetition (glacial hush, petrichor nostalgia) taught early; minor figurative density in peak kneel risks slight opacity but coheres without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scribe's precision and crystal resonance transforms abandonment trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with quartz/metronome inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
