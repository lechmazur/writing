<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority tied to glazier expertise (cracked silica, trembling hands) with embodied conflict in ripples mirroring divorce/daughter; earned endurance via realization without tidy epiphany. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "entire architecture of human experience" borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stone cast to standing waves complicating pattern, delivering CR closure in "patterns remained inscribed... luminous and unshakable" with conceptual cost of accepting prismatic dilemmas over solutions. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory vividness (mercury-still tide pool, mist burning away) filtered through glazier POV; prism atrium and tide pool constrain observation and charge final blaze image. Micro-setting (beach stone, pond) evolves causally to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate mundane via photons/ripples) deepens via interference patterns narrowing to richer complexity; agency in gentle cast and patient watch forces trade-off acceptance. Cost legible in foreclosed tidy answers, charged by tide turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of prismatic value in fragments emerges organically from glazier life/ripples/light without statement; final image of toolbox walk reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity of "cracks the day would bring."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (geometric panes, grinding wheel); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to blaze, prose-as-character reflecting reflective mind. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful figuratives (crystal lung, spectral components) taught early without muddle; minor overwriting in peak insight ("noctilucent reckonings") but clarity/propulsion intact through closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier craft, ripple physics, and dawn prism transforms mundane epiphany trope; risk-taking in sustained lyric texture heightens stakes of perception without gimmick.</comment>
