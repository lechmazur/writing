<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between escape and acceptance acts through arranging markers then gathering money; embodied in rust fingertips and wind on coupling; final renunciation earned but edges toward diagnostic labeling of "polished calm" without full embodied cost in boardroom flashback.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of regret patterns tightening to CR closure; orientation anchored in first sentence; cost legible in gathering bills and stepping onto coupling, foreclosing denial with acceptance of bloodline spiral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Train setting constrains via territorial markers from debris and charges final image of coupling and wind; sensory hierarchy (rust touch, fluttering bills, amber dusk) reflects Elias's perceptual priorities; no white-room, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comprehend circling paths) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through bill arrangement to realization; agency in gathering money forecloses escape path; cost felt in "perimeter of acceptance rather than defense" but lacks one live option narrowing mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of predation cycles emerges organically from father-son parallels in transit extraction, reweighted by spiral image without moralizing; final gathering offers resonant non-literal answer tying equity to shotgun; earned from particulars, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in geometric regret (lions, rust matching sky); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise on coupling; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bills as maps/regret); rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors coherent (moths, telescope); minor paraphrase loops on "calm" variants dull one peak reflection without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of startup collapse as lineage robbery in train sanctuary; risk-taking in accumulative reflection heightens thematic stakes; irreplaceable train/money frame transforms trope of inheritance into predation geometry.</comment>
