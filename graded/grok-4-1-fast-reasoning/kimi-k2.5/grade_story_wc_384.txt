<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in family heritage and precise patience, compelling her blood-ink forgery with embodied contradiction (trembling hands amid certainty). Internal conflict layers guilt and salvation without tidy resolution. Final weeping renunciation earns stasis through prior isolation's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patient forging accumulates to sealing and placement, yielding Charged Poise closure: document detached, her burden unlinked with sacrifice's cost in "she finally wept." Orientation anchors Elara's sanctuary by paragraph 1; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora's pulse, and dripping stalactites constrain isolation and time pressure while charging final exhale and fading light image. Sensory filter (visual pearl twilight, mineral music) biases through her endurance. No white-room; micro-setting (altar hollow) enables delivery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge peace treaty) signaled early tightens via clause completion and sealing, narrowing to courier handoff with visible cost (blood sacrifice, endured guilt). Endurance agency crystallizes stance; moral calculus between treason and lives saved legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forged forgiveness emerges organically from blood-ink lie and sealed wound, reweighting vengeance chain in final weeping image without moralizing. Particulars (rose thorn lineage) yield resonant ambiguity: treason saves via sin of creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, with perceptual signature of precise, patient noticing (ink strokes measured). Rhythm modulates to charged release; purposeful repetition teaches accumulative texture without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density weaves action, motif, atmosphere without loops, though motif recurrence (drips, thorn) risks template cadence in mid-section. Rhythm varies for propulsion; metaphors cohere in lyric mode, vivid at closure ("rose emblem bloomed"). Minor scaffold in reflective paraphrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms forger trope via "calibrated treason" for peace, with obsidian seal's conceptual flip inevitable from heritage buildup. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, committing to premise without hedging.</comment>
