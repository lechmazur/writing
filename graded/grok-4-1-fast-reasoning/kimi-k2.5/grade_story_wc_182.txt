<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in concrete moments like tracing the lily petal, revealing contradictory impulses between action and listening to absence; her shift from extraction to renegotiation feels earned through prior botanical discoveries, with visible cost in patient endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of gaps and encodings builds to CR closure; the diary's marginalia pays off conceptual cost in the chrononaut's fade ("released not by force but by... acceptance"), reweighting intervention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mountain's tunnels and botanical rhythms constrain choices (lichen guides, root systems avoid shelves), charging final garden image; sensory details like "grinding protests of stone against paper" filter through Elara's linguistic-botanical bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve concepts tightens via diary revelations narrowing options from physical traversal to linguistic exchange; agency in renegotiation forecloses violent intervention with felt cost in unnecessary rescue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance over intervention emerges organically from particulars like pressed flowers encoding loss; final image of cataloging crystallized errors offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting time travel's premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in semantic voids and botanical ciphers; rhythmic prose modulates from careful cataloging to swelling symphony, maintaining diction coherence under conceptual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and reflection without loops; varied syntax propels from "trembling with residual chronology" to finale, though minor metaphor density in descent slightly risks overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical encryption and linguistic voids transforms time-travel tropes; risk in mountain's "linguistic exchange" heightens stakes, culminating in inevitable garden of errors.</comment>
