<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in "breath clouding in the cold air," revealing shift from frantic creation to pauses; final endurance to create anew earned via cave discovery. Minor diagnostic tone in "purpose she'd sought in all those years of burning too bright" edges below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ledger fragment cues frost patterns leading to cave journals for CR closure ("not evidence of crime, but of sacrifice"), with felt cost of her self-inflicted fire legible in final image. Orientation anchored early at canyon rim; single tightening via crystalline maps suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frost patterns as micro-setting constrain pivotal choice to cave, charging final melting-into-memory image; canyon's "silvered sandstone" and "red rock like frozen flame" mirror internal crystallization without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose via ledger) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through frost-guided discovery narrowing to CR; her agency in following ruts forecloses despair path with cost of past studio torching felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden supports ("ledger of love") emerges organically from cave revelation and her fire, reweighting art/life premise in final "map of devotion" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in struck-bell hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with glass/fire perceptual signature ("crystallize like glass cooling") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens pauses, no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax in peak cave beat ("crates of her father's charcoal, untouched"); minor metaphor density ("frozen flame," "burning too bright") purposeful without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of smuggling sacrifice funding child's art, transformed via frost-led discovery; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
