<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solitary POV delivers concrete interiority through embodied glassblowing actions and thumb-tracing bookmark, rooting motivation in crafting safe zones with earned endurance at abandonment. Contradictory impulses subtle in dramatic narration versus isolation's crush, shown not summarized. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing like "exactly where the thawing heart needed her" borders diagnostic without full deduction as it ties to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of melting imagery and glasswork builds to Charged Poise closure in packing tools and exiting "pursued by spring," with legible cost of leaving safe zones. Orientation anchored early via control room and glacier. Single tightening via morning abandonment forecloses paths; lens unambiguous at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details—dripping mast, hissing hot plate, melting ice cores—filter through glassblower's priorities, constraining choices like treacherous ice bridges and charging final glinting spheres image. Micro-setting of blowpipe and spheres evolves causally with thaw. No white-room; vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting safe zones amid thaw signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sun-struck drifts narrowing to abandonment, forcing renunciation with on-page cost of left-behind spheres. Agency in micro-choices like sealing bookmark shows trade-offs. One deepening via thawing cores suffices; cost unmistakable in final walk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation amid release emerges organically from thawing imagery shifting to buoyant hope, reweighted in bookmark-sealed sphere without moralizing. Final "Exit, pursued by spring" offers non-literal resonant answer to isolation-as-sanctuary question. Complexity in weighty lightness avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature: contemplative rhythm in syntax like "patience was not passive but a kind of active prayer." Dramatic narrations feel goal-driven against silence. No head-hopping; voice modulates poetically under solitude's pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud with purposeful syntactic swells, high density in multi-job lines like melt descriptions advancing atmosphere and stakes. Minor overwriting in figurative density ("silica required 1400 degrees to transform") risks coherence but pattern-taught as voice; no loops dull closure. Zero scaffold; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower preserving thawing "heart" in spheres transforms isolation trope via dramatic narration and bookmark legacy. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes organically; non-obvious angle on abandonment as release feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
