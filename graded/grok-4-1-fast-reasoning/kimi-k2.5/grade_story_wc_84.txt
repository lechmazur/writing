<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority peaks in embodied vibrations resonating in teeth and sternum, earning the final belonging realization; perpetually surprised trait adds particularity without dominating; grandmother backstory anchors motivation but borders BRR limit, slightly flattening micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure—"missing pieces assembled...in his chest and mind"—repricing wandering life with undeniable emotional cost; orientation anchored early via footprints and star charts; single scene causality intact via alignment sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's astrolabe and gears constrain alignment choices, charging final image; dusk's "brilliant dimness" and chill filter through Elias's sharp-eyed perception, evolving with action; tactile, lived-in navigation via lever strain elevates beyond vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding belonging tightens via star-trail calibration and lever pull, narrowing to insertion with physical strain as cost; Accumulative escalation via intensifying frequencies reweights internal options; subtle agency but legible price in "desperate insistence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Belonging-as-frequency theme emerges organically from chip insertion and cosmic resonance, repricing premise in final stars-dance image without moralizing; subtext layers via grandmother's chase mirroring Elias's; ambiguity of "patient stars" invites lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in astronomical precision and embodied noticing (e.g., "hummed with latent potential"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in mechanism grind to closure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chip description advances plot/character/theme); varied rhythm survives read-aloud without loops or scaffolds; figurative density coherent in cosmic motif, no muddle touching closure despite occasional elevation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of typography/radio waves/belonging frequency transforms sci-fi tropes into inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes; no derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
