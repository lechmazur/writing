<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (margin avoidance vs. center confrontation) act in scene; taping choice earned by denial history with embodied cost (trembling smudge).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of anomalies culminates in RR/CR via taped illustration with legible complicity cost; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Margins/center station constrains avoidance and charges final glass reflection; anemometer and frost selective, POV-filtered for meteorological urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Anomaly tightening via illustration forecloses denial option under Accumulative lens; complicity cost visible in log-taping act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Migrating plant reweights fault-tolerance as collapse denial; taped-center image resonates as non-literal answer to complicity question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meteorological perceptual signature (isobars as fever dreams) distinct; rhythmic modulation heightens post-fever haze without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Figurative density purposeful in lyric buildup, no loops dull closure; minor "swallowed" echo motif-charged, varied rhythm propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fault-tolerant oracle denying climate shift via fever-blurred predictions fresh synthesis; lyric risk heightens stakes legibly.</comment>
