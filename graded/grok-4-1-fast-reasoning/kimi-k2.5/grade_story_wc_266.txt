<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's embodied panic ("trembling fingers") and micro-choices under pressure (pressing palm to stamp) reveal contradictory impulses, earning the closure renunciation of the leash; minor slip in stock wise-guide traits and bordering therapy-speak ("reservoir of bravery") does not touch pivotal grotto beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via path images to RR closure ("trusting her own unsteady steps... carried her found courage home"); cost legible in deliberate steps sans leash; orientation anchored early at shore, one tightening at grotto realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and bioluminescent grotto constrain traversal choices and charge final image of dawn-breached horizon; sensory details (mist clings ankles, star stamp glints) selective via Mara's anxious POV, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Atlas/courage) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through indirect paths narrowing dependency options; agency in heart-stamp acceptance forecloses retreat with felt cost in un-leashed return, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of courage despite fear emerges organically from leash break to heart-stamp ("continuing despite it"); resonant final image reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "found courage home."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (fog as panic, paths as lessons); rhythmic diction modulates from hesitant to resolute, consistent under stress; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("salt and old wood and the memory") slightly muddles one mid-beat without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of service-dog leash as anxiety tether with surreal ridgeway guides transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at un-leashed dawn return.</comment>
