<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's arc from clinging to "purity of their original vision" to raw, stumbling lines shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning surrender with fading voice as cost. Lira's mischievous pressure forces micro-choices that reveal values. Final stance crystallization feels character-particular and motivated throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echo density builds refracted poetry toward CR closure where spire dims and paths multiply, with Kael's voice-into-bone as legible conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in canyon/towers/ritual timer. One tightening via Lira's jar-release cascades into Overseer disruption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain sound as "theft," multiplying verses to alter stakes; canyon choreography clear with rib-outcropping and rim appearances. Sensory hierarchy (hollow groans, giggles refracting) reflects Kael's poetic urgency. Final towers "singing" charges closure image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract truth before ritual lock) signaled in first paragraph; accumulative escalation via Lira's twists and raw poetry deepens pressure, narrowing to surrender as Overseers' shouts refract into questions. Agency in "Kael sat... began to speak" forecloses polished vision with voice-loss cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness's price emerges organically from refraction metaphor, culminating in non-literal final call: "Forgiveness costs the story... the teller," reweighting Kael's guarded truth into "infinite variations." Jars shattering offers resonant counter-reading without moralizing. Particulars like Lira's rhymes avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (sound as seeds/theft) biases toward echoes; voice texture poetic yet propulsive, modulating from hush to "hum with accumulated poetry." Lira's dialogue distinct ("you keep making noise") with child subtext; no head-hopping, elision paid in ritual payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "groaned beneath their touch, a hollow sound swallowed..."); varied rhythm accelerates to climax hum/shatter without loops or muddled metaphors. No scaffolds, figurative coherence (prismatic shards/seeds) taught early. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic resistance in bone-echo world transforms allegory into lived stakes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens refracted closure without gimmickry. Irreplaceable particulars like echo-wraiths/jars make defiance inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
