<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's scheming pacifism shines through precise, empathetic micro-choices like turning the pin, rooted in embodied memory of trauma; entity's form as "resentment given human form" reveals character under pressure effectively. Minor ding for entity's swift dissolution lacking deeper contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure in entity's dissolution and sanctuary's brightening; cost legible in "holding on required more energy than letting go." Single-scene structure flawless, orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary as DNA-coded cathedral constrains choices, warps under grievance gravity, and charges final image with pulsing translucence; cellular memory micro-setting integrates tactilely into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of convincing release escalates via pin-turn flicker and sanctuary shudder, narrowing options under Accumulative lens; protagonist agency drives deepening with visible energetic cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resentment's release via primordial cellular peace emerges organically from particulars like pin-winding lullaby phantom; final image reconfigures grievance as energy-draining without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (bodily remembrance, shifting grace) modulates rhythm under climax pressure; clean single-POV, projected dialogue carries subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative density borders overwriting in climax ("architecture of compassion laid like trapdoors"); no loops, clean syntax supports lyric cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of DNA sanctuary, returning pin-key, and cellular pacifism feels inevitable; bold premise transforms resentment tropes through biological ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
