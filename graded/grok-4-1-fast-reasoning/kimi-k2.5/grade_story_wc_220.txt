<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and motivation rooted in Ash's sensory gifts compel the search; "hollow space that ached to be filled" reveals character-particular endurance against quitting dogs. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from sensory buildup to Conceptual Repricing closure; leaf discovery under solar panel reconfigures loss into presence with legible emotional cost in "legs weak" and final lick. Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via persistent search suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scrapyard details constrain search and charge final image; "sifting through decades of abandonment and oxidation" mirrors internal regret tactilely. Recurring rust/scent hierarchy reflects hound POV perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect via riddle) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through three-day search narrowing options; agency in persistence yields felt cost of ache. Entry to 8.8+ solid but lacks overt trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistence emerges organically from riddle/events; final "distance collapsed into the space between his teeth and the leaf" reweights premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; charged by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("translating the scent of copper oxidation into memory") biases noticing hound-specifically; rhythmic compression modulates beautifully under search pressure. Stable limited POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; "groan of settling steel into weather reports" multitasks vividly. Minor artifacts ("intuitively descriptive" repeated awkwardly 3x as label-like insertion) dull line-level slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hound "reading" phonograph grooves by ear transforms post-apoc tropes ingeniously; riddle-leaf synthesis feels inevitable from sensory premise. Bold animal perspective risks pay off in fresh emotional cartography.</comment>
