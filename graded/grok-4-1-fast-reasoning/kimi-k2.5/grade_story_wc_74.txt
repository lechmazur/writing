<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's insomnia as vessel and gift for moon-sparked visions root a consistent, intensifying motivation; embodied "saffron quiet" reveals character under vigil, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via building visions to CR closure at "surveyed the glowing evidence of thirty-seven words," reweighting lost languages with conceptual cost of atmospheric persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity and smog-choked city constrain painting via moon-filtered glow, charging final "cathedral of extinct gratitude" on fogged walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake of proving kindness via lost words escalates accumulatively through glyph density and moon climb; insomnia cost felt but no sharp climax trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glowing glyphs and final survey resonate as non-literal answer to kindness's endurance, reweighting premise from evaporation to "spaces between heartbeats."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward "moon transmissions" and rhythmic modulation sustains stable close-third POV through pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; dense metaphors purposeful without muddle, minor overwriting in descriptive runs slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moon-brush painting extinct mercies via insomnia transforms magic realism inventively; final glyph survey feels inevitable, risking bold lyric synthesis.</comment>
