<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via embodied gestures like tracing wood grain and smoothing brittle paper, revealing rooted traits under reflective pressure; earned shift from resistance to acceptance shown through vineyard-tied realizations. Minor slips in diagnostic phrasing like "intersubjective understanding" feel unembodied mid-epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from solitude cue to CR closure in final image of hand-to-earth synchronization reweighting separation as maturation; cost legible in foreclosed merger fantasy, "boundaries exist to be pressed against, not crossed." Orientation anchored early at pavilion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "faintest sweetness rotting" and amber walls filtering sacramental light mirror internal states and constrain realization space; pavilion/vines charge final pulse-sync image, guiding choices through terroir-rooted parallels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling orthodoxy with mismatch philosophy deepens accumulatively through vineyard-instructed parallels, narrowing to acceptance; agency in standing/brushing leaves forecloses stasis with felt cost of solitude-as-invitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mismatches/wine-love emerges organically via particulars like Malbec-Riesling analogy shifting to root-yeast metaphor; resonant CR ending reweights without moralizing, though "nurture intersubjective understanding" borders explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature biased toward viticultural intimacy modulates rhythmically; stable single POV filters all through Elena's embodied noticing, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel reflection, but paraphrase loops in repeated "parallels" and "destined mismatches" across realizations create minor redundancy; figurative density coherent without muddle, though elevated in sustained low-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of viticulture-heartbreak via oxidation/fermentation inflections transforms tropes organically; vineyard philosophy as love crucible feels inevitable and riskily poetic without gimmick.</comment>
