<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Astonished recluse's stillness enables perceptive endurance, with trembling hands and contextual observations embodying contradictory wonder; final acceptance as repository earned via prior micro-choices like opening the box, foreclosing speech with silence's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations densify from ghosts' flickering to covenant patterns, tightening to ghost's palm on box ("transferring the burden... required no currency but attention") for Charged Poise closure with legible conceptual cost of eternal witness; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Scorched hives and acacia constrain ghosts' paths (avoid northern quadrant) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (humming in teeth, clover scent) POV-filtered, selective for urgency; box as micro-setting refracts stories into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering covenant's weight) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ghost patterns → box opening → contact, narrowing to endurance with burden's transfer as felt cost; agency in attention/sitting coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unspoken words/covenant emerge organically from bee promises severed by fire, reweighted in box's "permanent stains upon air"; resonant CR answers preservation question without moralizing, lingering ambiguity of regrets' gravity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("contextual clues," posture language); rhythmic prose modulates from stillness to crystalline realization, diction biased to tactile apiary ghosts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative density ("heavy as honey, bitter as smoke") borders overwrite in recognition beat, slightly dulling peak immersion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghosts archiving covenant in beekeeper's recluse transforms spectral trope via apiary specifics; bold lyric accumulation risks stasis but heightens mute eloquence's stakes inevitably.</comment>
