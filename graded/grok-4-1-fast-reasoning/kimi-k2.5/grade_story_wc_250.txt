<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in traits and embodied in gestures, but lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle acting simultaneously, keeping it from 9+ test; serenity dominates without micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise/CR closure; lowering the mirror ("work complete for this turning") reconfigures light/dark relationship with conceptual cost (defiance of entropy) legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective and purposeful, with dock edge and shutters constraining weaves/actions; final indigo gleam and shutter map charge closure image per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching darkness) signaled early with textural escalation via pattern density, fish ripple incorporation as pattern break, and cadence shift to midnight; agency in adjustments forecloses entropy with felt cost, entering 8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of light/dark companionship emerges organically from particulars like shutter patterns and mirror flashes; final shimmering darkness offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (reflections over penetration, shadows as grammar); rhythmic modulation and lyric compression taught early, legible at closure with no head-hopping, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but patterned repetitions ("weave," "half-spoken secret") border minor scaffold without harming closure; metaphors coherent and voice-motivated, no major loops or overwrite dulling peak images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guardian trope via mirror/shutter mechanics transforms silence into empathy; risky lyric structure heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight with non-obvious conceptual turn.</comment>
