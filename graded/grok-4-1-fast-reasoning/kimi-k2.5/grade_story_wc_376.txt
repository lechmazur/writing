<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation to recover lost truths drives consistent micro-choices like piecing the map and confronting Marcus, with embodied emotion in trembling hands and wilting leaves. Internal conflict emerges in verifying marginalia amid suspicion; her change (leaves unfurling) earned by journey's risks. Marcus applies relational pressure via detected lie, revealing character flaws without stereotypes. Minor slip: some motivation told early rather than fully dramatized in opening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (map, plates, Marcus) build density to CR closure—leaves thriving in vault reweights lost truths as preserved sanctuary, with journey cost felt. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (Aurelia at dome, city collapse). One tightening via lie detection narrows path to vault. Structure fits defaults: single POV, continuous progression with spatial flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse details (vines, condensation, hydroponic forests) constrain navigation and charge final contrast (toxic sky vs. vault sanctuary). Sensory hierarchy via Aurelia's priorities: ink-stained fingers notice etchings amid steam. Setting evolves causally (thicker air nearing quadrant), mirroring internal honesty arc without overt symbolism. Recurrent glass dome/dripping panels guide choices tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover history via letters) signaled early, tightens accumulatively: wilting leaves force Marcus confession, enabling vault access with access/fear cost. Agency in persisting through zones; reversal narrows options from suspicion to alliance. Climax tests commitment as plates unlock door. Stakes viscerally felt in wilting zones risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unguarded truth emerges via leaves' responses and letters' confessions, culminating in resonant CR: "truth finally had a sanctuary" reweights premise without stating moral. Subtext in Marcus sigh amid silence; ambiguity lingers in post-truth rebuilding. No tidy resolution—fear persists outside.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (truth-noticing via leaves); diction poetic yet grounded (ash swirl, zinc clicks). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual: "Candor...saves lives" pursues goal, distinguishes voices. Rhythm modulates from tense navigation to poised closure. No head-hopping; elision of postal history paid off at vault.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: sentences multitask (e.g., "zinc plates clicked...confirming the route" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm suits accumulative build; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors (ash swirl, failing sun) but consistent, not muddling closure. Clean mechanics, strong verbs propel to vault image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: biological truth-leaves + postal plates as map/keys/locks transforms lost-mail trope into honesty quest. Risky poetic world logic (gilded mutations, sealed vents) heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration (transcribing truths) inevitable from particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
