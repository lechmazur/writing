<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to translate heartbeats into maps roots actions in craft and heritage, embodied in glacial finger movements; micro-choices under cold reveal value hierarchy. Minimal on-page contradictory impulses limit to very strong, as steady patience lacks simultaneous internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds to sealing, yielding Charged Poise closure in pulsing map with exile/cold cost legible in "binding her own heartbeat to the light of a dead sun." Orientation anchored early in orchard/crater; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Permafrost and aurora constrain patience/actions physically; withered orchard as grandmother's ties to motivation, charging final image. Sensory selection (crystalline breath, blue-white cold fire) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (create heartbeat map) signaled early, escalates via pattern density to ignition under Accumulative lens; agency in precise vial-tracing forecloses imprecision with skin-biting cold cost. Enters high band as final trade-off charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inward navigation via pulse-topography emerges organically from ritual; final "compass point that points inward" reweights particulars non-literally with conceptual cost of exile/endings as coordinates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (alchemical/cartographic bias in "geometry of the heartbeat patterns"); rhythmic modulation heightens ritual tension, diction controlled and voice-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm; purposeful lyric patterns taught early avoid loops. Figurative density slightly overwrites build-up ("cathedral of ice," "tectonic shift"), docking from peak without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of flash-paper alchemy, preserved supernova light, and heartbeat cartography transforms tropes; risk in subarctic ritual heightens inward stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
