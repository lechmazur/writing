<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to debunk myths drives consistent micro-choices like reassembling letters; interiority embodied in trembling hands and stained fingers. Final repair earned via prior causality. Minor shortfall in on-page contradictory impulses during settler confrontation caps at very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: observation → letters → reassembly → intuition → repair decisively expands stillpoint. Closure DC lands on-page with cost in "the stillpoint was failing... collapse within months" paid by her fix and settlers' required learning. Orientation anchored early in orchard grove.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (circling dust storms, iron-skinned trees) reflects Mara's priorities and constrains stakes; flawed diamond as micro-setting charges final alignment image. Spatial choreography clear from grove to root cellar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debunk/protect orchard) signaled early, tightens causally via letters revealing failure, forcing repair agency. Escalation forecloses collapse option with on-page cost in modified resonator hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth over myth emerges organically from diamond repricing and settler accusation; final image of Mara departing reweights superstition with comprehension's durability. Resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of sharp observation (dust perimeter, letter scraps); voice modulates rhythm in peak repair hum. Brief settler dialogue natural, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel through reassembly; "sharply observant" triple repetition creates minor template cadence artifact in opening and peaks. No loops touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flawed diamond as stabilizing broadcast transforms post-apoc trope into fresh physics; synthesis of myth/science payoff inevitable from letter causality. Risky conceptual pivot heightens stakes legibly.</comment>
