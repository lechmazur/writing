<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation for permanent rest is embodied in "throbbing behind her eyes" and "vibrating through her sternum," compelling the climax alignment; stubbornness acts as "necessary architecture" with contradictory resistance yielding to task without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from crate summons to library ascent, landing Charged Poise closure when "light erupted—not outward, but inward, folding the impossible space"; orientation anchors in first paragraph, cost legible in lens crumbling and her eternal librarianship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impossible geography constrains descent ("water accepted her ankles, then her waist") and charges dome climax; library shelves hold settled dead, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor displaced dead) signaled early, textural escalation via drifting whispers to lens alignment forecloses shifting graves; agency in "she raised the lens" narrows options with crumbling cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chased stillness emerges from particulars like floating books and settled chairs, resonant in final "address that held" reweighting burial's futility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (undertaker noting unrotted columns); rhythmic prose modulates from pulsing distress to ringing silence, perceptual signature in "books floated like schools of silver fish."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, metaphors like "ocean had opened like a wound" purposeful and oceanic-consistent; minor repetition of "inadvertently stubborn" slightly dulls mid-ascension propulsion but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse lens revitalizing soul-locations in library-lighthouse transforms undertaker trope; risk of surreal physics pays off in inevitable "singularity of peace."</comment>
