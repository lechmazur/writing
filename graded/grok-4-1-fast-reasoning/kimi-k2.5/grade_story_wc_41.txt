<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in persisting despite knowing forgetting will erase success, embodied in "tidal longing pulled at his ribs"; final renunciation/endurance of eternal cycle earned by curse's prior toll. No unearned epiphanies; flaws drive inevitable forgetting that compounds. Micro-choices like clutching chalk reveal values hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density spirals inward to center, cadence shifts at writing sound then forgetting for Charged Poise CR. Orientation anchored early ("junkyard prophet... garden"); closure cost legible in "stranded in the present with a map to a treasure he had already buried." One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fog sculptures and driftwood constrain choices (markers spiral inward, forms shift when not looking); chalk as micro-setting anchors reality at climax stone-writing. Sensory hierarchy biased to Elias's auditory quest amid visual hush. Final image charges with dust arrows mirroring internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture aging's sound) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative density to pressure-beat hearing, narrowing to write before forgetting. Agency in trailing fingers, furious notation forecloses retention path; cost felt in sternum vibration post-unspool.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of futile capture amid precognitive forgetting emerges organically from particulars like chalk marks "utterly meaningless" now; final image offers resonant CR repricing curse's eternity without moralizing. Subtext in shifting faces "he would eventually forget were his own" lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature ("taste of rust and silver oxide," sound as "pressure"); stable close third-person POV biases to Elias's fog-filtered noticing. Rhythmic modulation accelerates in "wrote furiously"; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "driftwood arrows converged" advances plot/setting); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language coherent/patterned in lyric mode without muddle; minor density in peak metaphors contained, closure image propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal premise (fog-trapped futures, audible entropy) transformed via specific curse logic into inevitable eternal cycle; risk-taking in nonlinear forgetting heightens stakes. Fresh synthesis of junkyard mysticism feels organic, no tropes unearned.</comment>
