<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to prove listening heals is clear and dramatized through story-gathering, with embodied tracing of locket; elders like Mrs. Rodriguez feel slightly stock (trembling fingers cliché), but Alvarez's deferred grief earns change at climax without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stories sediment to mailbox climax (RR/Charged Poise); cost legible in "shoulders shaking with decades of deferred grief" as community exhales, reconfiguring bonds before demolition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid courtyard at dawn (rays on dust motes, marigolds, jackhammers) filters through Maya's priorities, constraining choices via encroaching noise; mailbox recurs as pivotal constraint charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock mystery/prove healing before erasure) signaled early; accumulation tightens to Alvarez's approach, narrowing via demolition pressure; agency in following forecloses forcing, with felt cost in timed ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing emerges via accumulated stories and letter's truth; resonant non-literal end (hands linking, foreman bowing) reweights community; explicit "proving that listening heals" in motivation and close echoes thesis, flattening subtext slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person Maya POV with lyrical perceptual signature (currents of memory like springs); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; rhythm modulates to hush at "profound silence," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid images, but overwrought figures pervade ("dust motes...sandstorm," repeated "sandstorm calm," "healing water"/"desert silt" mix); minor paraphrase loops (waiting motifs); propulsion holds but artifacts dull peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thrift-locket legend and neighborhood ritual halting demolition; locket-mailbox arc transforms lost-love trope via accumulative listening; risk in quiet communal poise pays off without gimmick.</comment>
