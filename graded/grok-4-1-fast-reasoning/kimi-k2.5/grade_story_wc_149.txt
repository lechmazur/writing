<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Julian's contradictory ecstasy/agony and ancestral guilt compel the planting choice with embodied cost; Eira's traits drive negotiation without safety-hedging. Final bead transfer reveals hierarchy of values. Minor omniscient slip into Eira's feelings late does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ghostly appearances and memories densify to RR closure (veil dissolves, stars emerge) with felt cost in "sorrow inseparable from release." Orientation anchored early; shard transition from greenhouse to fields legible. Bead causality tightens without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mercury-rich soils and endless night constrain hauntings and choices; phosphorescent fruits/recurring glass condense mirror internal shifts. Final snowflakes charge closure image, evolving causally from manufactured cold. Sensory hierarchy (chill, mists) reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) signaled early, escalates via bead-triggered "resonant awakenings" flooding guilt, forcing Julian's agency in planting with visible cost (shuddering ground, mixed weeping/laughing). Pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing through ancestral pain emerges via bead/images, reweighted in final "mournful elation" without moralizing. Subtext in Eira's "heal through hurting" implies complexity; snowflake cameos offer non-literal answer to debt's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (ghostly flickers) stable in third-limited; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("The debt"). Minor late omniscient into Eira ("she felt") controlled. Rhythmic control heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in peak beats (bead press: "flooding his blood with the weight"); metaphors consistent without muddle. Minor motif repetition ("ephemeral cameo appearances") taught early, no loops dulling closure. Propulsion strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alchemical ghost debt with bead convergence transforms tropes organically; "resonant awakenings" as quicksilver guilt fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric haunt pays off in star-cracking closure without gimmickry.</comment>
