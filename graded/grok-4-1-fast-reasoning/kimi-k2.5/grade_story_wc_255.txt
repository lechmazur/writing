<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's colorblind perception drives concrete micro-choices like plant arrangements and reed offering, earning her realization; contradictory desire for color versus textured beauty acts in scene. Marin's silence-to-voice shift reveals through scarred fingertips and bellows, with felt relational cost. Minor slip: "innocently cunning" label slightly abstracts a shown trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from plant codes to reed's song, landing CR closure in "Elara realized... searching for the wrong awakening" with conceptual cost of accepting imperfection. Single scene anchors who/where/when by line 2; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint of silence and ash shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard's silica, soot, and kiln constrain barter via plant proximity and furnace access, charging final withered/regrown plants image. Sensory filter via Elara's grey gradients (cerulean as light-to-dark grey) biases perception purposefully. Evolving ash-cinders mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken sight) signaled early, tightens texturally via failed color/song reversal that forces realization trade-off. Reed heating forecloses cure path with embodied heat/vibration cost on page. Agency in calculated stems and canvas sacrifice coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect beauty emerges from grey paintings, plant barters, and reed's voice, answered non-literally in "new painting of the sound itself, all in shades of understanding." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like shattered glass fragments. Counter-reading (Marin's relational cost) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited Elara POV stable, with perceptual signature in "disturbances in the grey" and texture-over-hue. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating to resonance at "grey resonance that matched her perception of thunder." Marin's sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines like "dipped her brush into what she assumed was cerulean" advance character/setting/voice. Rhythms vary (short peak sentences at song), no loops or scaffold. Minor figurative density coherent via phoenix cohesion, no muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: botanical code + warped reed + colorblind gradients transforms phoenix trope into bartered imperfection inquiry. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via plant-to-voice escalation. No template echoes; voice commits boldly to grey-world authenticity.</comment>
