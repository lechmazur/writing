<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation clear and consistent as witness arbitrating meaning, driving spiral actions to unification; interiority concrete via dictionary handling and path-measuring steps. Lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, rendering her more archetypal than flawed individual. Climax choice to write unifying word feels earned but lacks visible internal cost trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through spiraling circuits and crumbling definitions toward CR closure (blank page word unifies silence/sound). Orientation anchored early (witness in temple library at universe hiccup). One tightening at outermost ring/apex forecloses duality with conceptual cost in library folding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly specific (obsidian shelves, vaulted hush ringing like bell) filters through POV urgency, constraining path via maze/spiral staircase. Recurring dictionary as micro-setting charges final image (warm, bleeding definitions). Sensory hush/degrading pages mirror internal arbitration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel illusions) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via precise definitions amid folding library, narrowing to unification under hiccup pressure. Agency in reading/walking/writing forces conceptual trade-off. Cost legible in erased path and becoming-void realization at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of spiral meaning/unity emerges organically from particulars (apple vs. absence, end/beginning cross-reference). Final image (written word, becoming library/silence) offers resonant CR reweighting duality without moralizing. Subtext in linguistic fossils charges closure non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (wanderingly exact scrutiny of fossils). Rhythmic prose modulates from meandering to crystallized (spiral to blank page). Purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at unification.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud with purposeful repetition (resounding hush, wanderingly exact) building texture without loops obscuring cause. Dense lines integrate image/action (definitions crumbling to dust). Minor overwrite density in mid-spiral slightly dulls peak propulsion before closure clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh cosmic premise transforms end-times trope via semantic arbitration/dictionary persistence. Risky lyric spiral heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at unification. Singular vision coheres without hedging.</comment>
