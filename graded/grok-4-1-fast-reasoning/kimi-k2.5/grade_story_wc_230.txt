<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene as rational mind rebels against ritual yet hands move to bury relic; final endurance of superstition earned by prior internal pressure with cost of shouting raw truths. Interiority concrete and embodied (trembling fingers tracing ink). No safety-hedging flaws; blind spot for science drives mistake into "discredited textbooks."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from soil test to relic discovery to ritual, culminating in on-page CR ("pressure lift...silenced") with felt cost of voiced truths and biological confusion. Orientation anchored early (suspended 30m above ravine). One tightening via glass eye pulsing "cold weight," narrowing to occlusion choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains choices (mycelium buries relic, storms force shouted incantation); recurring swaying trees charge final image under lightning. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (peat brushed from roots, harness creaking). Weather affects action (rainwater in flask), mirroring internal occlusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychological safety) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via relic temptation and ritual risk, forcing renunciation of council report. Cost legible in "devastatingly potent" truths shouted into gale, altering stance. Agency in occlusion paints eyelids, charges poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming private mind emerges organically from ritual events and relic's "private griefs"; final unshared smile offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting viral empathy premise. Subtext in spiraling gold iris vs. shared consciousness. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in fragile "seed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (mycological lens: "fungal network creating biological confusion"). Rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short sentences in storm: "I am afraid," she shouted"). Diction purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (sentences layer action/image: "brushed peat...struck glass"); rhythm varies (lantern light fragments). Minor figurative density ("clung like desperate prayer") purposeful, no muddle or loops in peak ritual. Clean grammar, no scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus, hanging orchard, glass eye relic transforms tropes (post-virus truth as curse) into specific moral calculus of superstition over science. Risky fractured tone heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight via mycelium occlusion.</comment>
