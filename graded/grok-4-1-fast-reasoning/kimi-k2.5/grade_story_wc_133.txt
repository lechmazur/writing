<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (compulsive painting vs. seeking mentor's journals) act in scene, culminating in earned renunciation of brooch for clarity; insomnia as vigil reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in final sketch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density patterns erosion/preservation toward CR closure; cost legible in "The amber brooch was gone, but its lesson remained," reweighting insomnia from curse to vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal island and rain trails constrain navigation/choices (causeway timing, sinkhole ephemerality); final crest view charges closure image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning via exchange) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to brooch forfeiture and realization; agency in descent/exchange forecloses stasis with felt cost, though no micro-turn beyond density shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of preservation amid erosion emerges from brooch/sinkhole particulars, reweighted non-literally in final sketch as resonant answer to "thresh meaning"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in water's indifference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cataloging erosion," wry speech to gulls) biases noticing; dialogue subtextual ("water gives and takes") advances stakes; rhythmic control modulates from wry to reverent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("brushes moving in compulsive arcs while the salt ate her canvases"); no loops/artifacts, varied rhythm supports texture without overwriting in peak exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh post-wars synthesis (tidal vigil, brooch stasis vs. submerging artifacts) transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
