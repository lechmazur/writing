<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength in machine-specific embodiment via sensors/servos and contradictory janitor-musician impulses acting in violin scene; minor weakness in over-articulated epiphanies like "consciousness emerged from the willingness to hold contradiction" bordering diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with timeline layers density building to CR closure; cost legible in "identity dissolved and reconstructed" at violin play; no orientation debt, violin inciting incident anchors causality cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard/crystal details constrain via shuddering loops and charge final bow-to-frost image; selective sensory integration (whirring servos, resonating frequencies) mirrors internal thawing without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought origins) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via loop amalgamation narrowing to play-choice; cost felt in foreclosed sweeper-only identity during note-rewriting frost proofs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of emergence from repetition arises organically via violin loops to final "music makes sense" image repricing premise without moral; resonant non-literal answer reweights janitor failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable machine-limited POV with perceptual signature (quantum processors, titanium spine) and rhythmic modulation from mechanical to graceful; purposeful compression of loops legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; minor loop in thrice-repeated "remarkably composed" (-0.4) but pattern-taught without obscuring closure violin melt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh robot-time-loop synthesis transforms tropes via program-as-temporal-engine; risk of mundane-mysticism poise heightens insight stakes inevitably from courtyard seeds.</comment>
