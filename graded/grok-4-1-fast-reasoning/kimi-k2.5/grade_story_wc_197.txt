<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation through memorized details and key salvage, driving micro-choices like boot retrieval under pursuit; interiority particular via ink-stained hands and stutter reference. Minor slip in unshown contradictory impulses during climax key-turn, leaning declarative over simultaneous tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: unraveling plans → puddle coordinates → tunnel run → key activation → DC transmission with escape cost legible in hydraulic locks and shaft vanish. Orientation anchored early at Fourth/Mercer; single-shard scope flawless, closure reconfigures resistance from unraveling to lighthouse defiance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Auric lagoon bioluminescence pulses responsively to key disturbance, constraining authentication and charging final holographic projection; puddle reflections at dusk guide navigation as micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy selective via Elias's priorities, mirroring internal defiance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcast truth vs. capture) signaled early via radio silence/searchlights, escalates causally through descent and insertion to climax eruption narrowing options; agency in key-turn forces trade-off with felt pursuit cost, charging escape image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory defiance emerges organically from revised archives reappearing in holograms, reweighting indifference premise via lagoon pulse without statement. Final image of waist-deep gold offers resonant non-literal answer, though minor risk of tidy counter-reading in Ministry collapse forecast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in petrichor/oil-slick bias; rhythmic modulation accelerates from street tension to cavern poise, diction controlled and voice-specific. No head-hopping or withholding; elision of compatriots pays off in solitary agency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "water lapping at his knees" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels without monotony. Minor figurative density in peak ("molten gold, spirals of amber") purposeful via pattern-taught lagoon response, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Puddle-map coordinates into bioluminescent switchboard ingeniously synthesize obsolete tech with coded resistance, transforming rebel trope via specific archival smuggling; risk-taking in lagoon mechanics heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
