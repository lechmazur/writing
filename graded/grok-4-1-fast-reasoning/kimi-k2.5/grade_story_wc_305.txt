<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied through tactile handling of hairpin and climbing under grief's weight; contradictory impulses peak in descent to plant, earning change with cost of surrender. Final choice forecloses preservation path on page. No diagnostic labels; flaws (reluctant holding) complicate to resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory/images builds to RR closure via planting ("sapling unfurled immediately"), reconfiguring grief with legible cost (relic buried). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Elias, grotto, duty). One tightening via tree-top realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto/trees constrain choices (climbing for clarity, root-soil for planting) and charge final image (clouds reflect dawn as he sits against bark). Sensory hierarchy reflects POV priorities (vine hush presses like wine). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment via surrender) signaled early, deepens via tree-top study narrowing to planting agency; cost felt in "hollow duty" transformed. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal need; one tightening forecloses grief-path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of endless returning emerges from particulars (pin to sapling), final image ("breathing in time with the grotto's... heart") reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of acceptance. No moralizing; ambiguity in "courageous participation" lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (ripness, cycles bias noticing); rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure. Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early via hush motif pays off legibly. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, rhythm varies (short decisive sentences in planting); metaphors consistent (wine/ripeness pattern) without muddle. Minor overwrite in reflective beats ("vineyard hush deepened, thick and ripe") subtracts slightly, but no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fantasy premise transformed via specific jade pin/scalloped planting synthesizing grief-cycle ingenuity; risk in scalloped ritual heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars, no template echoes.</comment>
