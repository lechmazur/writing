<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to nurture wonder is embodied in adaptive strumming and locket reveal, earning Milo's breakthrough with felt restraint; contradictory impulses subtle in cautious boldness. Milo's silence-to-speech arc credible via trauma cues like white knuckles. Minor slip: reflective backstory slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to eclipse totality with boy's note-hum-word as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, cost legible in trembling finger and endured trauma. Single scene anchors early (Elara, Sage Ridge, pre-dawn), no orientation debt. Persistent eclipse constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge's thin soil/exposed roots and eclipse chill constrain safety pocket, charging closure via sharpened shadows/muted amber. Sensory hierarchy (silver leaves trembling, temperature drop) mirrors POV priorities, evolves causally. Recurring curl glints reweight final image exceptionally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break silence via wonder) signaled early, textural escalation via eclipse deepening narrows to shared music with agency in adaptive playing/waiting. One tightening (boy's note) forecloses isolation path; cost felt in potential distress, visible in knuckles. Charges poise without resolution via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically from eclipse/music/curl particulars, reweighting trauma-to-healing without moralizing; final curl glint offers non-literal resonance to wonder premise. Subtext in silence/hum links past-future via present awe. Complexity lingers in trauma's endurance cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (adaptive grace, biological suspension); rhythmic modulation heightens eclipse pressure poetically yet legibly. Minimal dialogue natural ("Again"); no head-hopping or withholding. Diction controlled, prose-as-character reflects mellow caution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying to eclipse hush; minor loops ("softly adaptive," "dreaming roots") motif-taught without obscuring closure. No heavy artifacts; metaphors coherent (chords as water/cracks). Propulsion clear, minor repetition doesn't dull peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse therapy, baby curl motif, sage roots dreaming transforms trauma-healing trope organically. Risky poetic texture heightens stakes via eclipse poise without gimmick; irreplaceable ridge/eclipse/curl alchemy feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
