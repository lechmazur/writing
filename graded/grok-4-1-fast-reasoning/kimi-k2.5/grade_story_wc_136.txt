<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in "trembling certainty" and embodied precision of aligning ticket, earning final boarding with contradictory fear and conviction; no unearned epiphanies, flaws drive quest without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of cracks widening to punch materializing to archive reveal; on-page CR closure in "cracks blazed silver" with commitment cost, orientation anchored early in station at 3AM.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Starlit vault and cracks constrain path, mirroring internal state via Orion alignment; body/tool (boot, flashlight) charge final image, sensory hierarchy cartographer-specific without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sister's truth) tightens accumulatively as cracks direct to punch/board; agency in "hands moved with precision" forecloses retreat with felt heart-Morse cost, pressure coherent to end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of destruction-as-direction emerges via cracks/ticket to archive image reweighting maps as stories; resonant non-literal answer in infinite filing cabinets, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "mathematics married watercolor"; rhythmic diction modulates pressure, no head-hopping, voice biases notice geometry in chaos.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; minor figurative density ("trembling certainty" reprise) in climax but purposeful, no loops/scaffold dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic ghost train transforms trope via geometric cracks/phantom punch; risk in surreal logic inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
