<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's traits as logical dreamer shown through methodical actions like arranging algae and shells; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values with exhaustion cost at "sat among her decorations, exhausted but vigilant." Minor slip: internal conflict declarative rather than impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal pattern adjustments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from trial balloons to synchronizing timelines; on-page Charged Poise closure at gauge settling into "arrival" with felt exhaustion cost, reconfiguring possibilities. Orientation anchored early in grotto; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto specific and tactile, providing algae/shells/crystals that constrain decorations and charge final "walls reflected... multiple dawns"; sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities, evolving causally with revitalization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to revitalize timelines signaled early, escalates accumulatively via returning balloons and complexifying patterns narrowing to synchronization; agency in adjustments forces trade-off with "burden of knowing... rigorous calculation," cost legible in final vigilance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of engineered hope emerges organically from patterns proving "despair... a coefficient that could be altered"; final image of dawns reweights premise without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer with conceptual cost of endless vigilance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in mathematical metaphors like "elegant geometry of possibility"; rhythmic control modulates serene tone under pressure, diction biased toward logical dreaming without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors integrated but dense figurative layering in upheaval ("quiet revolution... logarithmic curve") slightly overwrites peak without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography/math across timelines transforms parallel-world trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via patterns charging closure.</comment>
