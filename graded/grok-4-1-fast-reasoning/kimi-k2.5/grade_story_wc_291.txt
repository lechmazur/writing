<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between detached precision and emotional penetration act vividly in the sketching beat; final empathy thaw earned by prior struggle, mirroring isolation with embodied cost in "weight of the face... as living, breathing anguish."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to pattern emergence; orientation anchored by ~50 words; CR closure via canvas face reconfigures case/self with legible emotional cost in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry mist/shale constrains descent and smudges charcoal, charging final hush image; sensory hierarchy (wet boots, humidity) reflects methodical POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve via fragments) signaled early, deepens via ribbon match narrowing to rival; agency in unified sketching forecloses detached path with thawing cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges organically through ribbon paradox and canvas face; final image reweights premise non-literally, thawing isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (bone/fabric reconstruction despite prosopagnosia); rhythmic control heightens dawning realization without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "geological wound"; minor metaphor density in revelation beat and "furrowed hush" repeat dock propulsion slightly, but rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's paradoxical method transforms cold case trope into fresh synthesis; risk in empathy thaw heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
