<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's voluntary chaining and non-violent blockade reveal contradictory impulses (patience vs. force) acting in the climax, earning her descent with the felt cost of the chain's limit. Interiority embodied in trembling fingers and worn concrete circle. Flawlessly individual without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: wall fall → scavengers → decoding → vault open → blockade, culminating in Charged Poise RR where scavenger retreats, reconfiguring options with chain's legible cost ("chain would remain above"). Orientation anchored instantly. Single scene flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Carnival micro-setting constrains via chain reach, piano keys, and counter hiding arrow, charging final sunlight-pierced image. Sensory details (dust settling, boots crunching) filtered through Elara's priorities, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect seeds non-violently) signaled early, tightens causally when mechanism alerts scavengers, forcing endurance agency that forecloses violence with on-page cost (immobility). Escalation coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of willing sacrifice for growth emerges organically from chain's circle to green shoots promise, resonant in final image without moralizing. Particulars like seed-fletching shift meaning subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing growing shadows in fletching); voice rhythmic and biased toward preservation. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-heavy ("Below is the future").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "patience worn smooth as stone") without muddle in peak blockade. Propulsion peaks in "floor groaned."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms post-apoc tropes via seed-arrow dial and carnival vault; chained liberator premise fresh, risks non-violence climax that pays off inevitably. Bold synthesis heightens stakes.</comment>
