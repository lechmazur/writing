<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storyteller's motivation intensifies through embodied sensations like copper veins glowing with reverberations, compelling the climax choice to speak the myth quietly; internal competence balanced by time pressure and curse's hunger yields earned stasis without safety-hedging. Contradictory impulses (subtle speech vs. loud trigger risk) act simultaneously in tunnel traversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes, bird patterns, and harmonics builds to resonant reconfiguration closure as diamond sings and curse dissolves into canyon, with conceptual cost of language's near-death legible in "grammar dissolving like mist." Orientation anchored early (tower, canyon, twilight); continuous scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Bone towers and porous ribs constrain choices via acoustic topology, charging final whispering gallery image; sensory hierarchy (texture to harmonics) reflects storyteller's priorities, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save language via diamond) signaled early, tightens texturally through bird-deciphered harmonics narrowing loud/subtle options; agency in placing diamond and speaking myth forecloses sacrifice path with felt cost in accelerating "death of the language" before dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of language preservation via texture/sound emerges organically from particulars like flawed diamond's fracture and bone organ pipes; final symphony image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting curse into harmless echo without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (copper-veined conduction of reverberations) and rhythmic modulation building to climax; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in legible closure, diction biased to tactile acoustics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops, varying rhythm propels via image integration like "throat-like passage"; figurative language consistent and pattern-taught (texture/sound), coherent in peak with diamond "sang... symphony" payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of copper-veined cyborg mythos, voice-collecting diamond, and avian acoustic mapping transforms tropes into inevitable closure; bold speculative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
