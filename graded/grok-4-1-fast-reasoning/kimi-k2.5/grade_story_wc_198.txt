<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in mentor's death compels precise silence-playing with embodied breath and fingers; internal conflict via nostalgic memories tilting present choices earns endurance at closure. Contradictory sorrow deepens silences effectively. Minor slip in over-articulated mentor flashback slightly dilutes peak immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from prophecy stirring in dewdrops to final dissolution via held emptiness; Charged Poise closure reconfigures threat with ongoing cost ("he would return tomorrow"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Lens holds cleanly to evocative end image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto's bioluminescent walls and prism atrium constrain tactics by amplifying un-sound and threatening phonemes through falling dew; final suspended dewdrop charges image. Sensory details (fog ribbons, dewdrop vibrations) filter via Elias's perceptual priorities, evolving with his hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hushing prophecy) signaled early escalates texturally as dewdrops form phonemes, forcing tactical deepening in inverse silences; agency in breath-wind deflection forecloses manifestation with legible cost of perpetual vigilance. Coherent pressure under Accumulative lens peaks decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-absence emerges organically via negative space swallowing code, resonant in final scattering into fog without moralizing. Nostalgia motif shifts from haunting to blanket of loss, reweighting duty. Final image answers silence's authority non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in noticing "spaces around [notes]" and fog patterns; rhythmic modulation heightens hush's texture under stress. Lyrical diction purposeful and consistent, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "dewdrops... threatened to release a phoneme"); purposeful repetition of "negative space" teaches pattern without loops dulling propulsion. Minor paraphrase in silence descriptors ("vested hush," "absolute silence") touches but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic prophecy countered by silence-architecture transforms musician trope boldly; risk in lyric negative-space method heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from grotto's logic to vanishing fog.</comment>
