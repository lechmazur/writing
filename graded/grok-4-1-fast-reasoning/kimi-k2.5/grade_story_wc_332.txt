<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied grief ("chest hollow") compels precise micro-choices like dipping brush in dawn light; interiority particular via librarian's synesthetic perception of whispers. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously cap higher score, though final desperate ray shows struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from whispers to chorus vibrating ribs; on-page RR closure as dream steps into watercolor with cost of eternal wildness ("simultaneously present and absent") reconfigures luminous absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago constrains by naming "exact shade of silver-blue," charging final silence; watercolor palette and silver-tipped brush as micro-settings evolve to "glowing with internal fire," mirroring internal states through goal-action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early tightens via density surge ("cipher intensified... chorus vibrated in her ribs"); agency in faster strokes narrows options, cost legible in dream's tentativeness and wild settling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of longing as luminous absence emerges via shifting negative space creature; final image ("shifting, breathing luminescence... there and not-there") non-literally reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (colors "tasted of nostalgia and regret"); rhythmic modulation under stress via shortening lines in climax breath-holding beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; figurative density in climax ("pulling photons... threads of dawn") borders overwriting without muddle, but "whispering archipelago" recurrences purposeful pattern—minor scaffold drags momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-capture via light-painting alchemy transforms folklore tropes; risk in synesthetic paradox ("brighter than absolute dark") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
