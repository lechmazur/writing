<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied memories tied to rake handle's inscriptions, driving contradictory penance and precise action; final renunciation of handle earned by 40-year arc with clear cost; 9+ test met as impulses act simultaneously in adjustment scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density building to on-page RR (Charged Poise in mechanism's sigh and handle left behind) with conceptual cost of lifelong debt paid; orientation anchored early; closure cost legible in descent and shelf placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and tide constrain climb/adjustment timing, pendulum bob charges final image; sensory details (waves' percussion matching heartbeat) selective via Elias's precision bias; micro-setting of rake handle mirrors internal state through tactile tracing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via inscriptions' calculations during four-second pause, forcing trade-off in handle's abandonment; agency in micro-adjustments with visible cost to town rhythm; cost unmistakable in mechanism's acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via precision emerges organically from errors cataloged on handle to final equilibrium; resonant CR in dawn descent reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in town's ignorance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of mechanical/tidal rhythms; diction modulates from searing memory to relieved sigh; purposeful compression in inscriptions pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic propulsion, varied syntax; minor overwrite in repeated "broken rake handle" phrasing purposeful but borders loop (-0.4); no artifacts dull closure image of steady tick.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwinder penance via inscribed rake transforms redemption trope; risk in tidal constraint heightens ingenuity; inevitable hindsight from 40-year buildup to handle's shelf legacy.</comment>
