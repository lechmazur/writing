<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's inventive precision and singular motivation to escape fate drive micro-choices like mounting the stone, with embodied emotion ("bleak exhilaration flooding her chest") particular to her; internal conflict subtle but present in transgression's terror. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevent 9+; backstory anchors present without flattening pressure. Final transcendence earned via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: tide reveals stone therefore mount yoyo mechanism therefore time reverses into CR closure ("stepped into the beam... vanished into radiance") with legible cost of uncertainty. Orientation anchored by para 1 (Elara, lighthouse, low tide); single scene, one tightening at initiation. Lens holds cleanly to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hunger stone and lighthouse constrain choices (grooves match axle, shaft mounts mechanism) and charge final image (inscription shifts to "Weep no more"); sensory details (kelp, damp sand reversing) selective via inventive POV. Tide's "slow exhale" evolves causally, mirroring reversal. Micro-setting (stone, yoyo) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape fate) signaled early, tightens via activation (time reverses, erases illness) narrowing to transcendence trade-off; agency in "initiated the final sequence." Cost felt in "terror of having no future"; one reversal sufficient under causal lens, charges poise at beam entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of negating predetermination emerges via yoyo reversal motif shifting to consume fate, culminating in CR repricing (no future as liberation); resonant non-literal answer in stone's inscription change without moralizing. Particulars (radiance feeding on shadows) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (inventive lens on mechanisms, time as gears); rhythmic prose modulates to compression under reversal ("stairs unbuilt themselves"). No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene acceleration ("unwinding the night itself"); density high, metaphors coherent (light "imprisoned... liberate... geological sleep"). Minor loops ("slow exhale," "neatly inventive," "bleak exhilaration") paraphrase without obscuring closure (-0.4); no scaffold in peak reversal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yoyo mechanics, hunger stone, lighthouse reversal transforms time/fate tropes organically; risk in counter-clockwise transcendence feels inevitable from particulars. Bold premise commits fully without retreat, heightens stakes via mechanical transcendence.</comment>
