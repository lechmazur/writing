<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions like "cautious enchantment, a wonder tempered by the awareness that this place held both invitation and warning"; final prayer earned via micro-choices in wandering and rebuilding, revealing hierarchy of values with ancestral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page RR/CR closure in "Elara knelt in that shadow, feeling the first genuine prayer move through her"; shadow on great-grandmother's tree legibly costs separation wound, one tightening via fragment collection suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices like "stepping carefully between root and scapula" and charges final image with "shadow fell across the specific roots of her great-grandmother's tree"; sensory details (myrrh, dusty beams) selectively mirror internal restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (faith restoration) tightens accumulatively via deepening discoveries (ledger, shoe, compass), narrowing to shadow/prayer with felt cost of unfinished lives; agency in wandering/rebuilding forecloses displacement path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of exile-to-return emerges organically from particulars like roots "drinking up the stories of unfinished lives"; final image non-literally reweights interruptions into "unbroken conversation" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "skeletal architecture of the branches overhead with a shiver of genetic memory"; rhythmic control modulates from curious tracing to prayer cadence, POV stable and biased toward ancestral waypoints.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loop in repeated "interrupted journey" phrasing across trees slightly dulls mid-section propulsion; no artifacts touch closure, figurative language (roots snaking bones) coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard where "roots had grown through their remains, drinking up the stories"; transforms diaspora tropes via sundial marking severed paths, risk in bone-fruit imagery heightens stakes organically.</comment>
