<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in "simple and terrible" drive shown through embodied micro-choices like combing to align pathways; resolute endurance earned but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from parsing static to chip's pulse syncing aurora; Charged Poise closure in placing chip amid "nothing truly beautiful...lost to the dark" lands with conceptual cost of eternal vigilance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Aurora as "residue of souls departing" canvas constrains parsing tactic and charges final pulse-sync image; crystal walls' hum evolves with capture, filtering POV bias selectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing spark signaled early tightens accumulatively as "threshold of stillness approached," forcing parse of "pirouette, a mother's face"; agency in pressing chip forecloses chaos with void's felt cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in process beats; purposeful lyric figuration like "dewdrops of consciousness" taught early pays off coherently without loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy of mortuary grace via meteor-chip soul capture in aurora-grotto transforms death tropes organically; final eternal watch feels inevitable from established ritual.</comment>
