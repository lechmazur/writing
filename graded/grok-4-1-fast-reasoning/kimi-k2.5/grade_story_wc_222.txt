<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "cautious abandon" approach to guardian, earning shift from thief to keeper; interiority concrete via sacred play beliefs driving micro-choices. Backstory of chivalry anchors without flattening pressure. Final exchange reveals values hierarchy with guardian's dissolution as relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual exchanges build density to RR closure in sky cracking and sundial ticking forward, with guardian dissolution as felt cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Kael on spire, wrong sky). No lens ambiguity; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Violet glaciers, copper-ozone air, altitude hallucinations constrain ascent and exchanges; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (thief notices star-misalignments). Final melting spire and jasmine rain charge closure image, evolving causally from ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend treaty) signaled early, escalates via piece swaps revealing truths, narrowing to final black king trade-off. Agency in deliberate grace steps; cost legible in guardian's trembling ice fingers and dissolution under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred play amending history emerges via chess ritual particulars, reweighting "lies told by men" in final sundial alignment without statement. Resonance in descent as "falls...flights in disguise," charging prior wonder motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (awe in deranged heavens); dialogue distinct—Kael's steady embrace vs. guardian's rasping challenge carries subtext. Rhythmic diction modulates from ascent tension to ritual cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("shadows that pointed in directions gravity did not permit"); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor overwriting in stacked figures during exchanges ("hummed with...unbroken promise") slightly dulls peak without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious chess ritual transforms treaty trope via secrets-inside pieces; sacred play synthesis feels inevitable in sky-healing payoff. Risky fantasy logic (time-amending sundial) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
