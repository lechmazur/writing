<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in "oath to archive history neutrally and the screaming necessity of revelation," embodied in trembling hands and heartbeat like thunder; final choice to upload and stand motionless earned by prior causality with arrest cost. Minor label-speak in "bravely conflicted" but dramatized through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of letter → moral crisis → upload via dormant networks → alarms; Charged Poise closure in Mara standing motionless amid blaring alarms, cost legible in "waited peacefully for them to come" as neural erasure imminent. Orientation anchored early in library vault; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "ice-coated keys" and "cold steel," charges final image where "towers of frozen memory... seemed less like tombs and more like seeds." Sensory hierarchy (absolute silence amplifying heartbeat, humming electricity) reflects archivist priorities; vivid integration like "neural imprints... in crystalline suspension."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vs reveal) signaled early, tightens causally at upload decision narrowing options; agency in scanning letter forecloses oath path with on-page cost of alarms and treason. Escalation driven by internal pressure, cost unmistakable in final peaceful wait amid blare.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation turning to provocation emerges organically from letter discovery to digital ghosts spreading; final image of silence "somehow changed" and truth "flow[ing] liquid and burning" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting frozen oppression without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in quiet's amplification ("heartbeat sound like thunder"); rhythmic control modulates from oppressive to expectant hush, diction biased to archivist's frozen motifs. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motifs ("dizzying quiet" taught early, pays off in shift to humming); minor paraphrase loops in silence descriptors (−0.4) but rhythm varies, no filter stacks or muddled metaphors touching closure. Propulsion clear in upload sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryogenic archive as truth vault with dormant networks upload transforming guardian to liberator; risk in quiet revolution heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from letter's discovery to "digital ghosts traveled... toward every unsuspecting citizen."</comment>
