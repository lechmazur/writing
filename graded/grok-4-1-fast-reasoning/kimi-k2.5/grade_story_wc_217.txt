<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to harmonize incompletes drives micro-choices like binding feather to kite, earning boy's wonder; embodied attention (fingers connecting shells) reveals values without internal contradiction slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: debris patterns build density to kite's snap ("kite string snaps"), yielding resonant reconfiguration in lopsided flight with legible cost of imperfection embraced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon constrains wading retrieval and sand patterns; drake feather as micro-setting charges final "green flame" flight image, filtering through poet's fracture-attuned bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kite ruin tightens stake via trade-off—restoration vs. harmony—foreclosing perfect flight; agency in weaving torn paper shows cost in eccentric spirals that still soar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of "fractures as doors" reweights incompleteness non-literally via kite's dance and poet's circle; emerges organically from feather-to-kite progression without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature fixates on light through tears and petrichor; rhythmic diction ("burnished hush") modulates with dawn-to-day, stable limited POV without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense propulsion weaves image/action sans loops; "drake's feather streaming... like a banner of green flame" varies rhythm, no figurative muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drake feather elevates kite trope into imperfection philosophy; woven dawns practice risks lyric accumulation that transforms debris into charged, inevitable closure.</comment>
