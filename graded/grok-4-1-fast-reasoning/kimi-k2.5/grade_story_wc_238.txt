<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to apologize roots in consistent traits like metaphorical advising, culminating in her raw direct "I am sorry" that abandons her idiom with visible cost to her voice. Contradictory impulses act in scene: metaphors vs. direct speech, earning the closure renunciation. Blind spots in her past shaming drive the struggle without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from bottle vibration to current peak and spirit dissipation, delivering RR closure (forgiveness as seeds) with legible cost in "miracles... leave the scar tissue" and bottle shatter. Single scene anchors orientation early; one tightening via spirit materialization narrows to apology. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sheet music archive and orchard constrain choices: acoustics anchor ghost, shelves enable circuit, roots receive spirit at end charging final image. Sensory details (dust motes, rosin smell) filtered through Elara's priorities integrate with action. Environment evolves causally with events, mirroring imperfect redemption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology before orchard falls) signaled early; agency in circuit setup and apology drives accumulative escalation to cadence shift at currents peak, foreclosing full absolution with on-page cost (partial forgiveness, unwritten column). Pressure coheres, narrowing options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect redemption emerges from particulars: metaphor-to-direct apology, spirit's warmth despite passage-through, seed image reweighting "cut down" premise without moral statement. Resonance ties to Elara's arc, lingering ambiguity in scar tissue. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: ethereal observations like "sound—a pure tone that smelled of rain and rosin." Voice modulates rhythmically under pressure; minimal dialogue natural, subtextual (static to cello regret). No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent without muddle, supporting texture. Minor figurative density in opening ("dust motes swam like silver fish") borders overwriting but integrates without obscuring peak currents beat. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: theremin-circuit exorcism via aria-perfume transforms ghost trope through orchard anchor and imperfect miracle premise. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes organically; final seed reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars without derivative hedging.</comment>
