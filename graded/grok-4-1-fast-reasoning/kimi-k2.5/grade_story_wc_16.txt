<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene ("careful yet reckless"), earning the closure choice with relational cost legible at "they dissolve at sunrise, and you leave with my blessing"; interiority particular and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to Charged Poise closure (symphony swells with hand-touch bridge); orientation anchored early at vault door; cost undeniable in pre-dawn risk of dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive setting constrains choices (selects schism tablets, triggers wards risk) and charges final image (heptagon glows, languages harmonize); sensory details like "ochre and forgotten grammar" filter through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust pre-dawn) tightens accumulatively through ritual deepening, forcing agency in promises; cost felt in exposure ("not with my silence"), charging Julian's arrival without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation via multiplicity emerges organically from particulars (seven schism tongues harmonize); final image reweights silence-to-speech without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (linguistic metaphors like "semantic binding"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You didn't wait for morning"), voices distinct; rhythm modulates pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "chimed like struck crystal") without muddle in peak ritual; minor density thickness in opening descriptions subtracts slightly from perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct languages as reconciliation instruments transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in ritual structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at glowing heptagon climax.</comment>
