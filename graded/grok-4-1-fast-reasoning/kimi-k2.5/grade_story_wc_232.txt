<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arthur's empirically intuitive trait drives micro-choices like trusting ants over maps, earning the closure choice to curate ghost maps; contradictory impulses (hesitation vs. promise) act in the flood-pressure scene. Interiority concrete via cartographic lens on landscape. Final renunciation of mere dealing feels earned by brother's legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ants' glow to cavern's pulse to chip's activation, culminating in CR closure where stepping through reconfigures purpose amid flood cost ("icy water licking at his heels"). Orientation anchored early (Arthur at creek mouth). No lens ambiguity; cost legible in timed fissure press.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming cavern constrains via fissure and flood, charging final glimmer "like sunrise through stained glass"; sensory hierarchy (nectar as "old paper," ants with "petals of glowing fungus") filtered through map-dealer's bias. Atmosphere pulses with foxfire moss, mirroring realization. Micro-setting (chip on stone) guides pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (doorway amid rising creek) tightens via agency: ants observation narrows path, chip press forces trade-off as water climbs calves. Under Accumulative lens, density escalates to flood crucible, crystallizing stance with drowning risk as cost. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting regret into responsibility emerges via mycelium maps of unlived lives; final image ("archivist of might-have-beens") offers non-literal answer reweighting promise without moralizing. Subtext in ants' "reverence" for chip echoes honoring dead's paths. Complexity lingers in purpose's sustaining cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: landscape read "like a rare manuscript"; diction/rhythm modulate under stress (short sentences in flood race). Voice texture via printing metaphors ("typewriter ribbon") biases noticing. No head-hopping; elision of doorway paid off in step-through.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "ant mandibles" advances setting/action/momentum); rhythm varies (long descriptive swells to clipped "twelve minutes, perhaps fifteen"). No loops, coherent metaphors (phosphorescence matching flora). Propulsion peaks in "gears that had not turned since the last century's flood."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: matrix chip unlocks mycelium archive via ants, transforming promise trope into empirically intuitive quest; risk in fantasy-realism blend (glowing cavern defying geography) heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from brother's "following ants home." No derivatives; bold curatorial closure.</comment>
