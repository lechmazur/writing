<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's quietly persistent nature and motivation to interpret silence as possibility drive concrete micro-choices like entering the train and approaching the fragment, earning the singing and realization with embodied emotion in his throat unlocking. Internal conflict subtle but present in feeling the "familiar pull" against 13-year silence. Minor slip in late epiphanic summary ("silence had never been his prison but his workshop") borders unearned but doesn't touch closure change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density builds from wind bells chime to misting hush deepening around song, culminating in CR closure where halo fragment hums post-song, reweighting silence as "pregnant with tomorrow's music" with conceptual cost of prior years reconfigured. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Elias, train, dawn). Single scene with one shard-like deepening (wrong turn oasis); no causality breaks, cost legible in final image of fragment scattering light "like seeds."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (velvet rot, porcelain tongues clicking, ferns unfurling) filter through Elias's carpenter bias (brass gears, oak), with greenhouse oasis constraining choice via "corridor that shouldn't exist." Micro-setting (marble pedestal, halo fragment) charges final image. Environment evolves causally (mist responds to vibration), mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism; 9+ gate met as setting shapes discovery and song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore voice/meaning via mechanism) signaled early, tightens texturally via fragment touch → song resonance narrowing to personal reconfiguration under accumulative lens. Agency in persistent approach and singing forecloses silent isolation with felt cost (13 years "rust" unlocked but song ends, fragment hums ongoing). One meaningful deepening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes ("infinite potential") before pivotal brush moment slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-creation emerges organically from particulars (wood staining lullaby recalled via song, shadows of horses), with final image ("his quietly persistent nature had been a song all along") offering resonant CR answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in mist/ferns responding charges ambiguity of "voiceless or alone." No thematic echo or sermon; complexity in endurance of silence as "workshop" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (notices "wood grain, to wind, to spaces between heartbeats"); lyrical diction ("whispering gleam," "misting hush") modulates rhythmically with intensity, compressing at song climax. No head-hopping or elision issues; prose as character reflects carpenter's patient ear for "what the universe whispered." Minor register elevation in realizations fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences weave action, image, sound (e.g., "pure notes, a lullaby... resonated with the halo fragment"). Rhythms vary (short chime sentences vs. flowing realizations); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Minor overwriting in repeated motifs ("whispering gleam," "misting hush") risks figurative muddle but pattern-taught early and charges closure without obscuring; clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carousel carpenter in circus-train oasis transforms tropes (lost voice, hidden artifact) via specific logic (fragment unlocks song, reconfigures silence as craft). Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes in textural hush-to-hum shift; final "scattered light like seeds" feels inevitable. No derivatives; bold conceit of train as "seed pod" personalizes ruin-to-rebirth.</comment>
