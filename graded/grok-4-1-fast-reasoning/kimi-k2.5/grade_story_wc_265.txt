<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory fear of immensity vs outward push acts in confrontation beat with stranger; gear offering and insertion earn final inner expansion with ongoing straying cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: translocation shards taught early build density to unravel witness; nexus gear insertion as CR reconfigures sense as compass, cost legible in "mapped country he could navigate."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wind through alloy leaves/palms/oaks constrains navigation choice; glass branches/fiber-optic moss charge drop and confrontation image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (inner frontier amid unravel) deepens via insight surge at stranger meet, narrowing retreat; gear action forecloses with network/inner acceptance cost under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Forest breath in "perfect fifths" reweights miracles as "complex patterns not yet fully perceived," resonant non-literal answer via gear-tree without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Philosopher's resonance-pattern signature ("hum of insight vibrated wrong") stable; rhythm modulates insight peaks, dialogue subtext sharp in "pruning dead philosophy."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density in translocation beats ("hung suspended in a cathedral of glass branches"); varied rhythm, no loops, purposeful figures like "cogwork rivers" propel without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mechano-bio synth (gearbox vines, photosynthetic whispers) transforms fantasy tropes; sleep-navigation risks heighten perception stakes organically.</comment>
