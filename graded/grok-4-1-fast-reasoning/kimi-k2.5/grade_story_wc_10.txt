<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (vibrations in teeth/sternum) and earned change from grief-colors to reconciliation, with micro-choices via fork strikes revealing values; minor reflection slips anchored to present but slightly abstract motivation in opening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via progressive fork strikes building density to RR closure in "white-gold radiance... reconciled with the quiet," with legible cost of enduring deafness; orientation anchored early in conservatory/deafness; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass constrains breathing/actions and charges final reflection; thermal projections as micro-setting evolve with emotion, filtering sensory bias through deaf POV; purposeful selectivity avoids catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rectify trauma) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via color shifts narrowing emotional freeze to thaw; agency in fork sequence forces trade-off with visible cost in final image; one decisive cadence tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-music emerges organically from thermal actions, resonant CR in reflection reweighting deafness without moral; no overt statements, ambiguity in "phantom limbs" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in thermal/colors; rhythmic modulation builds to crescendo; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload (frost flowers, auroras) in opening risks coherence (-0.3); no loops, strong verbs, rhythm varies; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, thermal cartography, winterglass transforms survival trope; risk in visible-music premise heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight via fork progression.</comment>
