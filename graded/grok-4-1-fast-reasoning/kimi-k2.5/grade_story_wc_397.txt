<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in rigid tourist desperation yielding to loose grace via shoe moment; motivation intensifies concretely through probing actions revealing lineage continuity. Final endurance of appointment earned by trawling causality with felt cost in shifted internal ice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from marina probing to shoe exhalation as pattern break, cadence-shifting to Charged Poise closure where parasol warms with residual charge, reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of release over desperation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Parasol tip as micro-setting constrains probing choice and charges final tucked filigree image; sensory selection (groaning bergs, clicking ice, stinging snow) purposeful, mirroring internal dissolution without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn ending's sound) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via shoe reversal narrowing to release realization; agency in volunteering/trawling forecloses rigid path with legible cost in "ice had shifted inside her."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of endings as tending/rearrangement emerges organically from shoe exhalation and parasol lineage; final aperture image offers resonant non-literal repricing of premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature of loose-gripped ethereal noticing (thinner light, windborne solace); rhythmic modulation heightens to crunching footsteps closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "hooked it with the parasol tip, lifting it clear"); figurative pattern (ice/wind dissolution) coherent and taught early, minor density thickness in reflective beats but no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism with disaster-trawling divined by heirloom transforms tropes; parasol-shoe turn inevitable from established marina logic, bold lyric risk heightens release stakes coherently.</comment>
