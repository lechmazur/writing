<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied emotions like pulse fluttering under lilac unease and micro-choices in mandala disruption reveal contradictory whimsical-to-serious impulses; final realization of grotto's loneliness earned by prior perceptual decoding without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as mist/sand density builds to on-page RR closure via tile crumbling and patterned silence; conceptual cost of destruction preceding clarity legible in final chalk symbol, with shard-to-disruption tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics and mist constrain diagnosis/mandala choice on floor; calcite shard and violet chalk as micro-settings charge harmony image, evolving causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode mess before erasure tightens accumulatively via shard discovery to eastern quadrant disruption, forcing reception pattern with reconfiguration cost in hush descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mess-as-message emerges organically from sand geometry and tile vibrations; final circuit symbol offers resonant non-literal answer on communication's entropy/order without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward geometry/vibrations (stone's anxiety like trapped bee); rhythmic modulation accelerates in mist thickening, with purposeful compression paying off at hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (sand aligning in ear shape) without loops or scaffold; lilac motif coherent, not muddled, though minor simile density in build slightly dulls peak mandala beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unlearning grotto acoustics fixed by chalk artist's mandala interjection transforms chaos/order trope; risk in disrupting own creation heightens stakes organically to emergent hush.</comment>
