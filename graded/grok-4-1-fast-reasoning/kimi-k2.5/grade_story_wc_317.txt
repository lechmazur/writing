<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to reimagine escape rooms intensifies credibly from frustration to action, with interiority concrete in blueprint-sketching and plant-watching; contradictory impulses (tolerate conventions vs. kill expectations) act in her all-night work; earned change to "curator of liminal experiences" forecloses derivative path with felt creative cost. Minor abstraction in epiphanies like "pure conceptual framework" slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as creative density builds from seed-planting to chambers via growth cycles; orientation anchors Maya, greenhouse, midnight early; mosaic shards (night→3 weeks→autumn→eve) taught by growth motif with legible transitions; closure CR in final image reconfigures innovation premise with conceptual cost of preserved space, legible in "surrendering to the storm."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (ozone, whispering brook, fractured lightning) filter through Maya's priorities, mirroring internal hush/transformation; recurrent brook constrains isolation for innovation, charges final image where rhythm synced her breathing; micro-setting (stilts, glass panes) guides choices like sensor installs without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard innovative space) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via seed→tendril→bud→test success→chambers, narrowing to orthogonal solutions only; agency in her building forecloses linear designs with visible cost (time, gale isolation); pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grotesque beauty in innovation emerges organically from flower-stench puzzles mirroring deception, orthogonal circling; final image resonantly answers via corpse flower's transcendence, reweighting conventions without moral; recurring "orthogonal approaches" shifts from sketch to test fruition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (storm motifs, hush phrasing) biased to Maya's receptive lens; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm from setup hush to gale cadence; no dialogue; purposeful elision of time taught by growth, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pressed the seed into... understanding that her motivation required reimagining"); rhythmic variety in read-aloud, purposeful motif repeats ("storm-born silence," "hush of a possibility"); minor patterned artifacts (−0.4): synonym churn on "innovation"/"discovery" loops in reflective blocks dull peak slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower as biological timer/puzzle dictator transforms escape-room trope via botanical cryptography; risk in grotesque deception motif heightens stakes organically; turns like test groups' orthogonal success inevitable from seed premise without late rules.</comment>
