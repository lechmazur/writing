<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority via dye metaphors and embodied heart pulses, with micro-choices like positioning the wing revealing values under identity pressure; final release earns change via prior observation causality. Minor slip: realization borders on unearned epiphany without sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the pivotal shadow-fracture moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of sun-trail observations tightening to CR closure in wing release, reweighting identity premise with fragility cost; oriented early (dye master, tea house, post-surgery). One meaningful deepening via prismatic shadow suffices; cost legible in height-fear shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating tea house and wing micro-setting constrain choices (rotation enables tracking, height pressures fear) and charge final image (wing as star reconfigures perspective). Sensory selection (iridescent shifts, mist parting) mirrors internal porosity via POV bias; purposeful economy integrates into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrate donor's story-magnetism) signaled early, escalates texturally via observation density to agency in release, foreclosing terror path with felt cost in sternum press. Pivotal tightening: shadow prisms force realization trade-off, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of porosity magnetizing stories emerges organically from dye/light images, resonant CR in wing spin reweighting premise without moral; counter-reading (caution as shimmer) embraces ambiguity. Final village threads drifting upward offers non-literal answer tied to arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (stories as dyes, light behaviors) stable in close third POV, rhythmic modulation heightens quiet pressure; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in realization beat ("quietly explosive truth detonate... soft expansion") risks figurative muddle amid peak density without full pattern offset. No loops; metaphors purposeful and consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of transplant heart as story-translator in dye-master's light-tracking ritual transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative design heightens stakes, inevitable in wing-release hindsight.</comment>
