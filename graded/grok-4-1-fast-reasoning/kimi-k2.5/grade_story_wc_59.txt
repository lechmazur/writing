<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particular through embodied hypothesizing ("bitterly sweet weight of possibility that now threatened to crush his ribs"), motivation intensifies to compel assembly despite shakes; final weeping earns bittersweet endurance with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in anticipation of flawed-world birth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to hatching as RR/Charged Poise; cost legible in "birth into a world of chains and smoke" reconfiguring redemption. Orientation anchored early (Prince crossing bridge in suspended palace); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via swaying palace ("chains groaned," "palace shuddered") pressuring assembly; charges closure with sunlight piercing cracks, dust as pollen. Sensory selective (hissing tears on coils), POV-filtered through Elian's reverie.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hatch egg for beauty) signaled early, textural escalation via assembly tightening to pulse/cracking; agency in persistence forecloses failure with bittersweet cost on chick's inheritance, felt in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (egg in coal dust vs. sunlight/pollen); final image non-literally answers flawed genesis with grace's return, reweighting mechanical world without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with perceptual signature (endless hypothesizing as lens); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity to hatching, no head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "hypothesizing about everything," "bitterly sweet," "quaking reverie" dull peak hatching beat (−1.2); high density but overwriting with mixed metaphors (thunder in silk) obscures propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm varies, but artifacts pervade final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk resurrection in hanging palace transforms tropes via textural DNA-memory math; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative drive heightens bittersweet stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
