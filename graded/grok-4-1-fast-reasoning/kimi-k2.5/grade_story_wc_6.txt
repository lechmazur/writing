<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied scars and micro-choices like pressing kelp reveal contradictory fire legacy vs. renewal drive; final graft endurance earned with felt phantom pain cost. Minor abstraction in reflective backstory slightly dilutes peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: textural density builds from preparation to submersion RR closure ("graft had taken hold... scars finally singing") with conceptual cost of past integration legible in final image. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lagoon minerals and kelp constrain graft success, black sand charges final sediment image; sensory hierarchy (shadows, iodine, cold water) mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scars singing) signaled early, escalates via prickling sensation to submersion deepening under accumulative lens; agency in ritual forecloses numbness path with on-page hope vs. risk cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fire consumption vs. revelation theme emerges organically from particulars like sand ghosts and kelp fusion; final shore stance offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting past without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (scar geography, tide vibrations) stable in close third; rhythmic modulation heightens submersion peace under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short submersion sentences build tension); minor paraphrase loops ("migration of clouds," "gracefully alert") and dense figuration slightly dull peak graft beat density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kelp-scar graft premise synthesizes fire/renewal ingeniously; bold lyric risk (unsanctioned alchemy) heightens stakes, transforming tropes through oceanic ritual logic.</comment>
