<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in unbinding—ruthless cut paired with tender shielding—earning the final realization as historian with complicity's cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from walking to reading, culminating in CR via sunlight on empty squares that reweights pawns' absence with conceptual exposure cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Whispering gallery and oculus constrain voice-projection and charge closure image; penumbra's passage evolves setting to illuminate absence purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind truth vs. lies) tightens accumulatively through unbinding to aloud reading; sunlight cadence shift forecloses performance-path with exposure's felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures vs. kings emerges organically; final sunlight on pawns offers resonant non-literal answer, recharging ledger's ordinary acts without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (half-false penumbra life) persists; rhythmic control heightens pressure in unbinding beat without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with no loops or muddled metaphors; varied rhythm propels to closure image without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of liminal politics, walking alphabet, and pawn-erasure transforms crisis tropes; penumbra-sunlight risk heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
