<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Diligent traits and luminous mind compel escalating choices from transcription to alcove singing; interiority concrete in dust-listening hums, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal dust-swirl beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from lyrics annotation to dust-paragraphs CR; closure reconfigures narrative dormancy via suspended stories with felt cost in dying coals and persistent mist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember alcove constrains singing and hosts dust formation, charging final suspended stories; mist pools tactilely guide action while sensory ink/must/reflection filter through luminous POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to end famine signaled early, deepens via lyrics-to-dust cadence shift narrowing to resonant success; agency in singing forecloses verbal paths with ongoing diligence cost legible in alcove image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting narrative from dust/music emerges organically, resonant CR in children-fingers tingling reweights silence without moralizing; ambiguity in broadcast silence invites lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward luminous melodies in dust/mist; rhythmic texture modulates from transcription calm to swirl intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring accumulation; figurative layering purposeful in lyric mode without muddle, though peak dust beat risks minor overload before payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pirate lyrics embedding dust-stories transforms post-famine trope into vibration-narratives; fresh synthesis of radio/dust alchemy inevitable in hindsight, risking poetic abstraction for ingenuity.</comment>
