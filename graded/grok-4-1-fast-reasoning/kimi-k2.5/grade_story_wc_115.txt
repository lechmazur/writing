<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism clashes with felt "presence of absences" in the tunnel's breathing, earning her shift to bearing witness; contradictory impulses act on-page as she traces beads despite disbelief, with visible cost in sternum's stone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: radio static density builds to CR closure where photographing beads reweights heroism/murder with sternum cost; orientation anchored early in tunnel post-confession; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel ribs "like the spine of some buried leviathan" constrain movement and mirror internal gravity; beaded wheel as recurring object charges final image, filtering through Mara's decay-rush bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (measure swallowed truth) tightens via radio-guided discovery to realization, narrowing options under accumulative lens; cost legible in "ripples through every certainty"; minor abstractness pre-wheel slightly mutes peak agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth's tonnage emerges from 16-bead mandala shifting to absences' negative space; final image reconfigures heroism/murder without moral, resonant via particulars over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (entropy rush, skeptical naturalism); rhythmic control peaks in "silence between heartbeats," modulating drowsy alertness without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., beads "catching her light in fractured rainbows"); minor overwriting in metaphors like "ectoplasm" risks coherence in opening but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious fusion of industrial guilt and beaded prayer-wheel retools ghost legend via chemical sludge preservation; risk of lyric reflection pays off in CR without gimmickry.</comment>
