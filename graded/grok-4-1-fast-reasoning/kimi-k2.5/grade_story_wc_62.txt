<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in family custom and grief-mapping quest compel the final ribbon-tying choice with felt cost of solitude. Grandmother's spectral presence applies precise pressure without dominating Elias's arc. Minor slip: minimal contradictory impulses shown in action, leaning toward smooth realization over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as meditative beats build density to Conceptual Repricing closure: ribbon web across graves reconfigures individual grief into collective mesh, with conceptual cost of infinite dimensions legible in "grief had no single shape but infinite dimensions." Orientation anchored early under glass dome; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting (vents' rhythm, orchids, butterflies against glass) constrains meditative chisel work and charges final image of ribbon spanning graves. Sensory details (violet sun, humid air) selective via Elias's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Body/tool integration (ribbon on wrist, chisel) heightens 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape of collective grief) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via grandmother's "retrace the grief" directive, narrowing solitary carving to web-pattern realization. Agency in retracing grooves and tying ribbon forecloses isolated mourning path with felt winter cost. Minor abstractness in stakes before ribbon beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective grief as woven mesh emerges organically from ribbon, poems, and graves without statement; final image ("mesh, a woven ribbon connecting every story") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting solitary loss. Subtext in spectral dinner custom enriches without moralizing. Complexity lingers in infinite dimensions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (poetic notices like "sun bled violet") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm for meditative intensity. Spectral dialogue natural/subtextual ("ribbon measures more than stone"), advances plot. Minor overwriting in elevated diction fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in image-driven sentences; rhythm varies with scene breath (short chisel beats, longer realizations). Purposeful repetition ("thundering calm") taught early pays off tonally. Deduction for occasional paraphrase loops on ribbon/grief in mid-section ("measurements...dimensions," "sorrow...grief"), dulling minor momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, butterfly migration, and poem-trading transforms grief trope into ribbon-mesh premise, inevitable in hindsight via greenhouse constraints. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; no derivatives.</comment>
