<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solemn archivist's motivation rooted in duty compels descent despite erosion of temporal grip; embodied conflict peaks in "searing reverie burning away boundaries." Minor diagnostic labels like "solemn duty" slightly abstract impulses without full contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise CR at "final black stone clicked into place," releasing trap via parley; cost legible in Elias's bone-settling realization and lagoon's reveal. Orientation anchored early via zeppelin deck over dunes; single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz dunes, obsidian shards, and beach debris constrain debris-arranging choice and charge final lattice-bridge image. Sensory hierarchy (salt/static clouds, warm sand) reflects psychic bleed; setting evolves causally with bubbling lagoon payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge eras to uncover truth) signaled early via psychic tether; accumulative escalation deepens through vision-tightening while arranging debris, narrowing to recitation with legible cost in merged archivist-casualty identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of history as confrontation emerges organically from debris negotiation and name-recitation; final image ("past and present align through lattice") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting preservation premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature of dual vision and psychic embodiment; rhythmic texture modulates intensity purposefully, e.g., feverish short clauses in arranging beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; purposeful motifs like obsidian avoid loops. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors during descent ("clouds that tasted of salt and static") risks coherence but stays voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil-rights massacre, retrocognition, and semaphore debris transforms tropes; risk-taking in zeppelin library and parley across time heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
