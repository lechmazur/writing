<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in "confidently uncertain" appraisal versus mercy choice at closure; internal conflict acts simultaneously via fact-recitation blocking memory. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy with cost in sacrificed precision. Minor diagnostic phrasing in reflections doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of facts/memories breaks at boy's entry, cadence shifts to CR closure ("understanding finally that his purpose...") with legible cost of precision-for-mercy on page. Orientation anchored early (trailer, Marcus's failure). One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quarry/trailer constrains isolation and echoes, mirroring internal resonance; cloth as micro-setting handled tactilely charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (wind whistle, fabric weave) POV-biased to roadie/appraiser. Details evolve with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticate for boy's need vs. Marcus's certainty/peril) signaled early, tightens at photo confrontation narrowing to mercy decision under Accumulative lens. Agency in vocal choice forecloses precision path with felt cost. No reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resonance over verification emerges organically from cloth/appraisal particulars, reweighted in final image ("relic of noise finding quiet meaning") without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures invites ambiguity on value's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (music metaphors, fact-specs under stress) with rhythmic modulation; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Is it real?"). Voice coheres as singular, roadie-inflected without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied syntax/rhythm supports ear-test. Minor paraphrase loops in "after the applause" motif taught early as echo-pattern, no closure dulling. Slight overwriting in valley similes contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh roadie-appraiser synthesis transforms authentication trope via echo/resonance frame; risks reflective mode heightening stakes without opacity. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
