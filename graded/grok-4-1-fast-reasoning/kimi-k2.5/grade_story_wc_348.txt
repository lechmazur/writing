<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via chemist's lens on foam and chrysalis; motivation intensifies through embodied grief shifting from constriction to flow; final polymer sketch earns change with cost of accepting divergence, per "argument as counterpoint."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure in notebook sketch and chrysalis gleam; orientation anchored early ("Dr. Elena Voss stood at the edge of the braided ravine"); cost legible in "grief loosened fully now, flowing freely downstream."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine and foam patterns filter through POV bias, constraining choices (descent, tracing); chrysalis as micro-setting charges final image on stone; sensory hierarchy (surface tension, river rush) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement via connection) deepens accumulatively through foam tracing and chrysalis; agency in placing offering forecloses isolation path; tightening at "divergence was not betrayal but necessary choreography" charges closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of separation-to-connection emerges via river polymers and symphony motifs, reweighting premise in final sketch without statement; resonance from particulars like foam "eddied in isolation, then rejoined"; no moralizing, ambiguity in grief's "ocean" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (molecular vibrations, scherzo bubbles); rhythmic control modulates from fractured sun to flowing resolution; diction purposeful, lyric compression taught early in foam patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (chrysalis "architectural ghost"); varied rhythm avoids loops, metaphors cohere (polymer chains/river braids); minor register elevation in "delta logic" fits chemist voice without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, polymers, and symphonies via foam models transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; final polymer design feels inevitable from ravine particulars.</comment>
