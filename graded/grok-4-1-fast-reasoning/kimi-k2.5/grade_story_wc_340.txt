<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete micro-choices like aligning cipher wheels under pressure, with contradictory impulses (hunger for understanding vs. detachment) acting in scene; final inheritance of captain's secret earned by causal progression through diary revelations. Warmly inquisitive trait shown embodied, not labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: elevator floors mark density increases toward CR closure where Elara reconfigures captain's tragedy into her inheritance, with conceptual cost legible in "disciplined capacity to study one's own pain"; orientation anchored immediately, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (prismatic symbols, frost-coated glass fracture) filter through POV urgency, constraining choice (goggles + light unlock diary) and charging final image of goggles as "crown of broken glass"; micro-setting of elevator spire guides ascent tactics seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (mapping joy beneath anguish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via diary deepening per floor, narrowing to Charged Poise where her stance crystallizes with felt cost of inheriting pain-study discipline; agency in persistent micro-choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty rooting in desolation emerges organically from diary particulars (auroras amid madness) reweighted in final image between "cloud ocean" and "stratospheric space," offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (inquisitive notice of light shades, creaks); rhythmic prose modulates with ascent intensity, no head-hopping, diction biased toward transcendent details in Elara's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring ascent (short hydraulic sigh vs. blooming metaphors); zero loops or scaffolds, figurative light-fracture motif coherent and purposeful, no overwriting in peak revelation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ascent metaphor with prismatic unlock transforms isolation trope via goggles-diary logic; risk-taking in accumulative floor-marked structure heightens inevitability of CR without gimmickry.</comment>
