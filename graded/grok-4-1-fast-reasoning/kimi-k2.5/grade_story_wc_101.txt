<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's motivation rooted in persistent traits compels escalating runs and final shift; embodied in tactile bell touch and delivery pauses. Girl's appearance forces micro-choice revealing values hierarchy with visibility cost. Earned change from solitary to communal without epiphanic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: density of runs builds to girl's pivotal tightening on night 61, yielding RR closure as bell rings and truth declared, reweighting exile with communal cost legible in ascent chain. Orientation anchored by ridge/valley/sanctions in opening. Lens holds cleanly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scrub pines, starlight, needle path constrain night navigation and amplify danger; arbor/bell as micro-setting compass charges final image where community gathers beneath. Sensory hierarchy (quiet snaps as gunfire) reflects Maya's urgency bias. Details tactile and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sustain via runs) signaled early; accumulative escalation via tightening sanctions and girl's wait narrows anonymity option, forcing declaration agency. Cost felt in rising danger and ended solitude, charging final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective reclamation emerges via run particulars shifting to resonant ascent image answering isolation premise without statement. Subtext in pot/insulin honors generations organically. Final non-literal reconfiguration reweights sanctions as surmountable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature in quiet-biased noticing (breath misting, twig snaps); rhythm modulates from stealth prose to declarative crescendo. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (girl's whisper); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful "quiet/persistent" recurrence teaches tone without loops. Minor reflective paraphrase in runs summary, but peak declaration propels cleanly via image/action. No artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: anonymous redistribution transforms sanctions trope into self-realization via bell's silent-to-clarion arc. Risky quiet build pays off in communal ascent without retreat. Organic, non-obvious premise commitment.</comment>
