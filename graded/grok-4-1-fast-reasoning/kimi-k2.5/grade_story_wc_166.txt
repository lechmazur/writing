<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in pivotal writing beat ("body ached to flow with the phantom tides" vs. "absolute stillness"), compelling transformation earned via prior muscle memory preservation. Interiority concrete and particular to tide dancer's gaps-observing lens. Minor abstraction in flawlessness slightly limits mythic depth, but micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from collection to inscription; CR closure lands cleanly in final image ("She had become the tide itself, written into being"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of permanent exile legible in "alarms would soon sound." Single scene, orientation anchored early ("twilight garden under stars"). No causal breaks; pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fountain as micro-setting constrains writing ("observing gaps in her own reflection") and charges closure (pools of luminescence from feet). Sensory hierarchy vivid and POV-biased (starlight gaps, bioluminescent pollen). Atmosphere tensions nostalgia ban with cosmic ungovernability, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve memory vs. ban) signaled early, tightens texturally via dust's "magnetic sorrow" anchoring skin, forcing stillness trade-off with dance ache. Agency in grinding/mixing culminates in permanence cost ("final phase," exile from human realm). Escalation coheres under lens, narrowing to cosmic hybrid reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic memory transcending legislation emerges organically from inscription acts, resonant CR in "living archive" reweighting ban's premise without moralizing. Final dance/image answers preservation question via garden's response, embracing ambiguity in hybrid form. Particulars like moonstone dust avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (gaps between starlight/shadow, atoms) biased to tide rhythm. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing at transformation ("ink burning cold as starfire"). Voice texture distinct, purposeful elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but patterned repetition ("spontaneously anchored" x3, "elective exile" x4) creates minor synonym churn in final third, dulling propulsion slightly; figurative density (nebulae, starfire) borders overwrite without full coherence loss. Closure image clear despite. Strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes tide dance, nostalgia ban, skin-verse in fresh, inevitable cosmic defiance; "pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" turn grows from gaps motif. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick, transforming exile trope via irreplaceable moonstone logic.</comment>
