<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, rooted in her translator's precision for pain (e.g., "dissected human pain," fingers bridging coral to plaster). Contradictory impulses emerge in her shrewd innocence masking defiance, earning the final vigil's endurance. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy, with flaw-driven ambiguity in carrying "smudged lexicon... in her own marrow." No closure unmotivation; fits single-POV excellence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cast notes to collective confession to CR closure in coral placement and "lotus-hearted ache" image, reweighting fragments into wholeness with emotional cost legible ("holds the ache like a lantern"). Orientation anchored early (atrium, translator, child by para 2). One tightening via unknotting suffices; no ambiguity or disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium, twilight mist pressing glass, and brain coral constrain her vigil and charge final image (coral as sentinel on windowsill). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: translator notices "tangled syntax" on plaster amid vapor/shadow. Details tactile (rough plaster, warm coral) mirror internal grafting without overt symbolism; spatial coherence flawless in single scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft meaning onto trauma) signaled early, tightens texturally via note-decoding revelation ("not random... map of trauma"), forcing endurance with cost (ongoing "truest translation" amid ache). Agency in micro-choices (unknotting, placing coral) forecloses isolation path. Pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of life grafting ruin (coral/reef, notes on cast) emerges organically from particulars, reweighted in final image sans moral (lotus line shifts to tenderness amid trauma). Subtext in silences/gestures invites ambiguity without confusion. Protagonist arc inextricable; resonant non-literal answer to survival's encoding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: syntax/decoding lens colors noticing ("unknot the tangled syntax"). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful (Pijin notes, "chemical surrender"). No head-hopping or withholding; compression taught early via mist motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multitask (e.g., coral warms as "neural networks... after shock"). Rhythms vary (short "Unknot this" amid longer builds); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks dull closure. Minor overwriting in metaphors (coral/plaster/re ef recurrences purposeful, pattern-taught), but no muddle in peak reflective beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Pacific translator decrypts war trauma via child's cast as "desperate archive," coral grafting ruin into promise—non-obvious, inevitable hindsight. Bold lyric risk (textural drive) heightens stakes without gimmick; transforms conflict-zone tropes through specifics (copra shed, lotus ache).</comment>
