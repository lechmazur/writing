<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the counting ritual versus station duties, embodied in gripping the key until impressions form skin; final renunciation of the key is earned by causal buildup of realization, foreclosing inheritance with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup in counting and sensory intensification to CR closure; cost legible in "placed the key on the stone railing" and walking into silence, reconfiguring time's illusion with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring granite, hydraulic hiss, and key constrain perimeter walk and charge final railing image; sensory details (frosting breath, dripping water) filter via shepherd's perceptual bias for edges, mirroring internal quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early intensifies via counting cadence shift narrowing illusions; agency in backwards method forces deepening realization, with visible cost of leaving key charging final poise under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as razor-edge present emerges organically from horizon/cliffs/key particulars; final image non-literally answers "what clocks measure" by reweighting gears as resistance, with lingering ambiguity in white silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in edge-obsessed noticing and rhythmic countdown syntax; stable close third-person POV modulates compression under insight pressure, prose texture lyrical yet legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with counting propulsion and paragraph breaths; purposeful motif repetition ("fjord quiet," "razor edge") taught early avoids loops, though minor density in metaphors slightly dulls peak zero beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydraulic-timekeeper epiphany via backwards counting transforms isolation trope; risk in lyric CR heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early key/edge setup.</comment>
