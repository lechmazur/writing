<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via tapping embodiment and data-driven curiosity; motivation singular and intensifies to earned CR via assembly; final sending of atlas as renunciation forecloses solitary hoarding with conceptual cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in-scene keeps under 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: data gaps yield CR on social forgetting, legible cost in "grief to become understanding"; orientation anchored in first para (Elena, station, post-2043); single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station console, drives, Pacific tide constrain reflection and charge final tapping image; atlas page as micro-setting evolves from relic to transmitted witness; sensory hierarchy (tactile salt/metal over visual) reflects scientific POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) deepens accumulatively via staccato tapping to halted realization, narrowing from physical loss to social; agency in assembly/sending forecloses isolation with felt memorial cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as navigation emerges from coral bleaching gaps and atlas reprise, reweighting premise in CR without statement; final image answers "why paths disappear" via witness transmission, resonant and oblique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (rhythmic noticing of tide/echoes) modulates with intensity; syntax echoes tapping cadence purposefully; no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm mirroring tide; purposeful "periodic" recurrence taught early, no loops/artifacts; closure image ("resumed her tapping, slower now") clean and charged.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief as institutional amnesia via atlas witness; risk in lyric accumulative CR heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable maritime-grandfather thread transforms trope.</comment>
