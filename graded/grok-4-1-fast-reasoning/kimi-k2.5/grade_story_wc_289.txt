<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in "fingers itching with the phantom weight of pens," driving motivated change from ghostwriting to public creation; final reunion earned by prior isolation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building from nest discovery to installation core placement; closure as Charged Poise in "two silences finally learn to speak," reconfiguring solitude with legible emotional cost of severed thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lily pond and temple petals constrain descent and courtyard work, charging final prism windows; selective sensory details like "rain hammered the pond into a silver froth" mirror internal states through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unaddressed heart signaled early, escalates accumulatively via nest tightening that narrows options to public weaving; reunion forecloses isolation with relational cost, though pressure internalizes softly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of secrets-to-connection emerges organically from nest spiral motif shifting to shared writing; final thrushes reprise reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of enduring whimsy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual signature in spiral/noticing patterns; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual at "I never knew," distinguishing voices cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative rhythm like "prismatic quiet," varying syntax without loops; minor overwriting in descriptive runs but coherent and voice-motivated, propelling to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter premise with thrush nests transforms isolation trope; risk in whimsical public arc heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via spiral pattern.</comment>
