<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scar-mapping and palm-linking reveal contradictory impulses (connection vs. release) with earned renunciation; abstract diagnostic phrasing like "teach suffocating to breathe" slightly undermines embodied crisis without full deduction as closure choice lands motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early pattern-teaching (burns/bridges/scars); closure as Charged Poise in "I can breathe now" and her departure reconfigures absence into integration, cost legible in Elias's settling vigil and fading threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary under starlight anchors early, constrains via "hollow heart" and "trembled with vibration," charges final image as "crucible" evolving from vacuum to vessel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching breath via absence) signaled in arrival whisper, tightens accumulatively through palm transmission narrowing dependency options; cost felt in her lighter steps and his phantom pressure lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of destruction-as-liberation emerges organically from bridges/smoke/scars, resonant non-literal answer in final integration image reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in fire/ash diction modulates rhythmically under pressure; dialogue subtextual ("burned the bridges so you would learn to swim") advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload in peak palm beat ("voltage passing through keloid") borders muddle; minor loops in "fading threshold"/"burned bridges" phrasing accumulate without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fire scars as conductive map transforms abandonment trope; risk in sustained metaphor web heightens stakes inevitably toward breath-from-suffocation reconfiguration.</comment>
