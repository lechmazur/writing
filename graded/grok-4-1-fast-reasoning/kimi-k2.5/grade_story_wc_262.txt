<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied psychometry ("celluloid teeth biting softly") and consistent motivation to map unused love; realization earned via deepening focus without unearned epiphanies. Minor abstraction in "emotions as architecture" feels slightly diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, limiting 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from touch to vision to CR in beam of light ("where possibility lived suspended"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost ("every cinema... bank for emotions never withdrawn"). Orientation anchored early (booth, film strip); single scene fits scope; cost legible in "carried the knowledge heavily."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Projection booth and film strip constrain action (ladder climb, palm press) and charge closure (booth as "skull," light beam as storage); sensory hierarchy vivid (ozone, dust, heat). Details filtered through spatial imagination (seats as "vertebra"); no white-room—evolves with psychometry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love storage) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening (heat, taut snap, pressure); agency in incubation narrows to CR with felt cost (heavy knowledge foreclosing naivety). One tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes—visceral in "hushed thunder."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of suspended love emerges organically from particulars (letters in emulsion, light beam); final image offers resonant CR ("medium that carries image from source to surface") reweighting prior visions without moralizing. Subtext in velvet seats absorbing heartbreaks; complexity in pooling intention vs. damage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (mapping as "warehouse," "neural pathway"); rhythmic prose modulates (short taut snap amid lyric flow). No elision issues; voice texture character-specific (spatial metaphors coherent under stress).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; refrain "while forgotten lyrics..." taught early as pattern, pays off in hummed songs. Minor overwrite in figurative density ("hushed thunder" x2, "crystal veins") coherent in lyric mode but borders muddle in peak vision; no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: psychometry on celluloid grief transforms storage trope into light-beam CR; risk in spatial lyricism heightens stakes (suspended possibility). Inevitable hindsight from early film touch to vault realization; no derivatives.</comment>
