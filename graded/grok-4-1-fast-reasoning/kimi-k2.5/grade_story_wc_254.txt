<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to reclaim transformative poetry intensifies through embodied palm contact and incantation, compelling the climax dissolution; interiority concrete in physical vibrations but slips into abstract epiphanies like "tremor of certainty crystallized into absolute knowledge" without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density escalates from hush to singing pillars and self-scattering; on-page CR closure via realization of self-imposed ban reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of materiality's dissolution in final shadow-dance image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt tiles, quartz hum, and frozen lake constrain choices (palm recognition activates, ice groans responsively) and charge final image of pollen-like scattering; sensory hierarchy (subsonic ache, thinning air) reflects poetic POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to activate via paraphrase signaled early, tightens accumulatively as phrases brighten pillars and blur form, forcing agency in stepping into liminal space; cost legible in self-dissolution foreclosing material self amid unbearable light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphic language reclaiming prohibition emerges organically from paraphrase action and colonnade response, resonant CR ending reweights "ban had never been external" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in ephemerality's eternal poetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of shadows, syntax, and frequencies modulates rhythmically with intensity; stable single POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's fractal shadows without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines but −0.6 for figurative overwriting in peak (mixed dissolving/light/shadow metaphors blur coherence around "scatter into patterns"); minor paraphrase loops like repeated "dissolving boundaries" dull propulsion before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic censorship fantasy with lyric transformation feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in boundary-dissolving premise heightens stakes via irreplaceable quartz mechanics without gimmickry.</comment>
