<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "merrily melancholic" humming amid chest-weight, embodied in clutching spinning compass; final renunciation earned by journey's micro-choices like paddling past breakers, confronting hubris without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via poles' progression to cove, closure as Charged Poise in beaching and setting compass down—"needle hunt for north and find only the magnetic pull of his own grief"—with legible emotional cost reconfiguring celestial pretense.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coastal specifics (damp sand, salt spray, humming wires, shale strip) constrain via poles' path and kayak strokes; final rocky outcroppings charge image, mirroring internal grounding without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align heart/action via poles) deepens accumulatively through surf breakers and cliff-face paddle, narrowing to terrestrial acceptance; cost felt in "penance" of forgoing stars, agency in endurance to cove.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hubris vs. earthly limits emerges via shifting compass/poles images, resonant non-literal answer in "broken things could still cast light, like a cracked lantern," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (stars betray, poles anchor) with nautical rhythm; purposeful lyric compression taught early, modulating to charged poise at "he smiled then, truly merrily melancholic."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short strokes in surf, longer reflection post-beach); minor density slip in stacked metaphors ("waves...shark...wet sail") early but purposeful for texture, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigator-by-poles post-failure transforms celestial trope; risk in solo accumulative journey heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via compass/poles contrast charging redemption.</comment>
