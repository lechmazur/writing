<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses in grief vs. ritual (e.g., "scream" confession to "whispered treaty"); pendant renunciation earned by prior micro-choices like moss-pressing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure; pendant placement on spiral ledge as decisive reconfiguration with forfeiture cost legible in "settled into its new context."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moss servers and icicle patterns constrain ritual choices (kneeling, tracing, placing); charge final image where pendant catches drop, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of private rewriting tightens accumulatively to pendant forfeiture, narrowing public repair option; cost felt in "protection did not require hardness" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truths needing soil emerges via decay/renewal images; final "thaw, drip, pool, absorb" smile reweights viral shame non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature on patterns (e.g., "erosion could be a form of language"); rhythmic hush-to-growth modulation purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates figuration (e.g., "fossil wasp") without muddle or loops; propulsion via image cadence, no scaffold in peak ritual beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moss-garden data center transforms tech shame trope into fungal grafting; risk of lyric solo-scene pays off in inevitable pendant image.</comment>
