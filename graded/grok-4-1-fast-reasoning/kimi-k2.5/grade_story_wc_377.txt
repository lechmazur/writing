<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve wonder drives precise adjustments and release of brake; seasonal muteness embodied as sharpened vibration sense enables work. Internal conflict subtle in age/altitude stiffness vs vigor, but lacks simultaneous impulses acting in pivotal release moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to mechanism activation; CR closure in "final bell rang... color of wonder settle over the bluff like snow" with conceptual cost of isolation felt. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment as micro-setting constrains bell tones via prisms matching "undertones she sought"; bluff's winds and thermal currents enable preservation and drive sculpture motion. Sensory details (hum through boots, groan of ice) filter through Elara's sharpened perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of perfect resonance signaled early tightens accumulatively via adjustments to activation; agency in "released the brake" forecloses failure with decades-hauling cost felt in final image. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of awe's necessity vs wordless efficiency emerges from particulars like iceberg's blue reminding "humans they were small"; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (vibrations via boots, ice groan) stable in close third; rhythm modulates from setup density to climactic brevity at "final bell rang—a clear, piercing note". No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwrite in repeated "glisten" and stacked metaphors ("symphonies of truth... physics of mass and motion") borders coherence dip pre-climax. Propulsion clear; no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-verbal world, bell physics as truth, and ice-preserved awe; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off inevitably in final reconfiguration.</comment>
