<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in prism-mind intensifies via recognition by her own seeds, compelling the alignment choice; embodied sensations like "stomach lurch upward" ground emotions. Minor slip in backstory summary ("she had planted the seeds... centuries ago") lacks micro-choice tilt, but doesn't touch closure. Final snatch of seed earns endurance with future cost implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links (inversion → threshold entry → seed alignment → inscription reveal); orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with legible cost in "the hour waned" and reversion forcing exit. Persistent time constraint shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains via mist as "permeable membrane" and rippling tunnels during inversion; sensory hierarchy prism-filtered (refracted angles). Seeds and doodle as micro-settings charge reveal and pocketed seed image. Evolves causally from latent blaze cooling at end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve combinations) signaled early, tightens via seed recognition narrowing to doodle alignment under time pressure. Agency in micro-choices forecloses delay with reversion cost felt in waning hour. Escalation causal, one decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of refracted loyalty emerges organically from self-planted vigilance recognizing her prism-mind, reweighting past insurance in final calculation. Resonant non-literal answer in emerging with combos/seed, ambiguity in "before the next inversion stole her chance." No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with prism perceptual signature ("refracted angles of possibility"); diction/rhythm modulates intensity (short tumbling sentences to pulsing lights). Purposeful fantasy compression legible, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mist coiled... like breath from some sleeping beast" advances atmosphere/action); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in inversion ("world turned inside out") coherent, no muddle at peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion, phosphorescent doodle-map, and self-vigilance seeds transforms retrieval trope via prism refraction. Risky physics consistent and inevitable to closure; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
