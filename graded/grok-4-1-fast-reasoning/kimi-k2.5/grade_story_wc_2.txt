<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the stone-crossing climax, where calculations fail and intuitive rhythm-matching yields the compass with embodied sway and leap risks, earning her reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragment breadcrumbs accumulate to greenhouse reveal, calculations' failure forces improv tightening, landing Charged Poise RR in compass alignment and chronometer's song with conceptual release-of-control cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall's irregular pulse and shifting stones constrain climax choices, while leaves' vortex reveals stairs and final constellation charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to retrieve compass tightens when measurements lie, forcing intuitive endurance across tilting/submerged stones with physical fall-risk cost legible in sway and leap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final compass-in-chronometer image offers resonant answer to planning-vs-chaos question, reweighting uncertainty from conquest to collaboration without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with clock-tinker perceptual signature ("frozen gears," "schedule spontaneity") and rhythmic modulation syncing to water's "chaotic music" in peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures like "vortex of ochre" woven into action; minor early figurative stack but no loops/artifacts dull propulsion or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Waterfall-stones improv synthesizes clockmaker precision with hydrodynamic chaos into fresh intuitive triumph, transforming relic-quest trope organically.</comment>
