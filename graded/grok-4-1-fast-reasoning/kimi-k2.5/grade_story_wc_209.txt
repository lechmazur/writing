<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in viewing mother as dark vs. hopeful, embodied in persistent postcard handling and repaint choice with emotional cost of reckoning; sexton adds pressure via revelation without dominating. Minor epiphanic summary ("truth settled... like sediment") borders unearned but doesn't flatten closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from postcards to glass layers to mural, with sexton revelation as tightening reweighting stake; CR closure lands on-page in "radical hope" realization and final brushstroke, cost legible in foreclosed misunderstanding of mother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (burnt sienna leaves, beeswax hands, steaming soil) filter through artist's eye; cathedral glass layers constrain revelation and charge final mural image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand night-blooming flowers/mother) signaled early, deepens via glass revelation narrowing misbelief; agency in daily returns and repaint forecloses path with felt grief cost, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of radical hope emerges organically from glass flowers pointing east, reweighted in final mural image without moralizing; postcards shift from melancholy maps to faith compasses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with painterly perceptual signature (colors shouting, honeyed light); brief sexton dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing revelation without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful painterly figures, but minor overwriting density in realization beat ("sediment clearing... pristine and resonant") risks coherence without stronger propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass lamination as faith metaphor transforms grief trope; layered flowers yearning eastward feels inevitable and risks bold lyricism heightening closure.</comment>
