<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory descent/ascent impulses embodied in crafting sensations; final self-release earned via decades of polishing and grief-folding micro-choices. No unearned epiphanies; interiority particular to lantern maker's tactile worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from shadow detachment to crane release; RR closure in "empty hands, now translucent" with conceptual cost of self-dispersal legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating tea garden and upward petals constrain final work and mirror ascent; basilica chimes integrate into action, charging closure as cranes pass spire.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grief-transformation stake signaled early deepens accumulatively through successive crane folds; agency in release forecloses corporeal self with translucent hands as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crane flight as grief-to-hope reconfigures descent/ascent duality without statement; emergent from particulars like ruby heart-blood crane, resonant and non-literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature fixates on gem textures and folds; rhythmic control modulates with crafting intensity, POV stable without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful ascent/descent refrain; figurative layering coherent in lyric mode, no loops, though peak beats border overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gem-origami cranes synthesize lantern craft and floating isle into fresh grief-flight premise; risk in abstract lyricism pays off inevitably at dispersal.</comment>
