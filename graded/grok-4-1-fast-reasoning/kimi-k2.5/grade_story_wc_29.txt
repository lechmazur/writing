<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices under pressure, like trembling hands patching the generator despite fear, earn the interference decision; interior conflict between hope and dread acts simultaneously without tidy resolution. Minor flaw in repeated "cautiously hopeful" label slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal linkages hold tightly from chart calculations to subsonic initiation and amplitude increase, delivering on-page Decisive Change at peak ("the cosmic entities would lose their anchor") with legible cost in sparks and temple pressure. Orientation anchors early; single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constraints like ancient equipment and transmitter limits shape tactics and charge closure (console sparks, flapping charts); sensory hierarchy narrows to thrum in boots and ozone under crisis. Micro-setting of console and window coheres spatial choreography without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timely interference tightens causally via 17-minute window and 90-second hold, narrowing options through amplitude risk; agency in modulation forecloses rage-inversion threat with on-page cost (overworked fans, personal pressure). Escalation driven by her choices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of human ingenuity outlasting cosmic malice emerges organically from subsonic discord mirroring tricksters' harmony; final smoothing of charts offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Particulars like mob faltering avoid simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature biased toward astronomical signals and frequencies; rhythmic texture modulates from swirling dust to deepened hum without filter stacks. Voice coheres as gritty-precise scientist under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensory, and reflection without loops, though minor figurative density ("dust motes danced... galaxies") borders overwrought in opening; propulsion peaks crisply at "subsonic frequencies peaked." Varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio as cosmic battleground with subsonic counter transforms discord trope through grounded mechanics and Elena's expertise; risk in quantum interference feels inevitable from charts. No close template echoes.</comment>
