<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's steadily curious precision and methodological drive compel higher-stakes confiding, embodied in tracing tape and multiplying paths; Elias's hollow-eyed foil applies relational pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously weakens peak interiority, but endurance in mapping earns closure stance. Final reverence from Elias crystallizes relational reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from card spreads to confiding demo, yielding Conceptual Repricing in "forward, but with careful attention to proportion" with legible conceptual cost of unchecked paths to void. Single scene anchors who/where/when early; no orientation debt. Closure image of charting next configuration reconfigures past refusal to measure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and oak table constrain choices via diffused light on ink and precise intervals, charging final image as storm passes; sensory hierarchy (drumming rain, clicking tape) reflects Mara's perceptual priorities. Evolving environment mirrors internal mapping, with thunder introducing Elias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping patterns to explain crashes) signaled early, tightens texturally via confiding revelation of widening Desire-Satisfaction distance, forcing forward methodology with cost of acknowledged past delusion. Agency in demo and snap retraction forecloses backward stability; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of measuring human geometries vs. digital calculation emerges from card distances and exponential paths, resonating non-literally in "every system contains the seed of its own unraveling." Final image reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of relearning proportions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in quantified archetypes and ink gleam; rhythmic modulation accelerates in snap retraction. Dialogue natural/subtextual—Mara's "Not back" pursues goal, Elias's question reveals status shift; voices distinct without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (soft clicks to decisive snap), high density integrates action/atmosphere; purposeful lyric metaphors taught early (neural network of cards). Minor figurative density in opening risks coherence, but no loops dull closure image of drying ink.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-crypto cartomancy as reverse engineering transforms tropes organically; risk in quantifying archetypes heightens stakes via irreplaceable tape measurements. Turn to forward mapping feels inevitable from exponential paths.</comment>
