<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in locust shell reminder drives micro-choices like heart-rhythm playing, with hesitation showing contradictory impulses. Embodied emotions via pulse echoing in shell. Final change earned as shell crumbles, foreclosing remnant with felt loss. Minor abstraction in epiphanic close prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: resonance density builds from soft music to orchard eruption. Closure as RR via trees uprooting and statues dreaming, with legible cost in shell crumbling to dust. Orientation anchored early on sky-bridge. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sky-bridge cables and orchard grates constrain signaling tactic; statues' grinding joints ground sensory hierarchy. Final swaying bridge and rusted gears charge image, mirroring wild return. POV-filtered details purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken wild vs. mechanical) tightens via music cadence shift slowing statues then erupting trees. Agency in escalating play forecloses detection option with shell's amplification cost. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens to closure charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tarnished wonder emerges via music rebellion, culminating in statue catching blossom as non-literal answer reweighting mechanical stasis. Particulars like welded blossoms vs. writhing roots build resonance without moralizing. Counter-reading in "taught it to dream" adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in organic/mechanical contrasts (honey with oil). Rhythmic prose modulates from hesitation to chaos without distance slips. Voice distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job sentences; rhythm varies to propel from hover to eruption. Figurative language consistent in lyric mode, no muddle or loops in peak (trees shuddering). Minor overwrites in setup don't touch closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin vibrations waking statues transforms music-magic trope via heart rhythms and locust amplifier. Risk in subtle rebellion heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from shell's evolution to dust.</comment>
