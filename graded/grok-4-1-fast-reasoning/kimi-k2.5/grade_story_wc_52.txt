<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deeply embodied interiority through carving micro-choices and mantra "here and gone," revealing contradictory impulses of grief and containment; final endurance earned via ritual's visible shaping of wood into handle, foreclosing clutching with cost in rust-hued peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build in carving and rain motifs to Charged Poise closure; final image of chisel pickup reconfigures absence into "furniture for the soul" with undeniable conceptual cost in transformed wood.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash wood constrain carving light/perception and charge final image, with sensory hierarchy (sawdust/man conditioner) reflecting Mara's widowed lens; purposeful selection mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief containment signaled early, escalates accumulatively through carving progress and boiling kettle tightening to deepened mantra realization; agency in endurance forecloses raw sorrow path with on-page cost in practical immortality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-woodworking emerges organically from ash blank's transformation, culminating in resonant final image repricing grief as "handle, heft, and daily use" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in rain-crystallized prisms and wood grain "rivers and canyons"; rhythmic modulation builds lyric density under accumulative lens, eliding action purposefully to heighten closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm and purposeful motif repetition (e.g., "weeping" skylight); no loops or artifacts, figurative coherence in rain lenses sharpening crystallized time without muddling peak carving beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-taming rituals into woodworking grief-processing, with risk-taking stillness heightening stakes; "hauntingly practical immortality" of kettle handle transforms widow trope inevitably from circus-tree origins.</comment>
