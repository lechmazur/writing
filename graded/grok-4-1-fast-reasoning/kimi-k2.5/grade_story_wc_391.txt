<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of restrained wildness act simultaneously during crossing ("pounding of her heart" vs. "boots never hurrying"); final endurance earned by prior mapping causality with cost of predecessors' haste.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure; viaduct dissolution ("promise kept and released") reconfigures options with legible cost of fleeting timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake constrains slow crossing choice ("groaned beneath them"); viaduct distortion charges final image of receding sanctuary as milestone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Six-minute viaduct window tightens stakes under Accumulative lens, forcing trade-off in restraint; cost viscerally felt in "pounding heart" amid deliberate steps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density propels via varied syntax, coherent metaphors like "wolves dressed in meditation" in buildup beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic viaduct from rain/iron/moon synthesizes fresh, inevitable world logic; risks abstract patience via concrete crossing heighten stakes.</comment>
