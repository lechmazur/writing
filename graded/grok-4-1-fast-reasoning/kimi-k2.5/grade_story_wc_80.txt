<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait yields contradictory impulses acting in scene (no gasp at toy yet imagines girl's heartbreak), earning final endurance with physical cost of shivering triumph. Interiority particular via surveyor's precision amid grief. Final note placement as micro-choice reveals values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to door-wresting to note-sealing, culminating in Charged Poise CR where surfacing reconfigures lost permanence via enduring notes. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in "building is slowly kneeling" and dawn shivering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains choices (wading to floor, straining rusted hinges) and charges final image (notes in "fissures that resemble broken sheet music"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: chill grips fingers amid professional measurements. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map lost dreams before collapse) tightens texturally via toy discovery and door-opening, forcing endurance with strain cost. Cadence shift reweights via final theory note. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interlaced absence theme emerges organically from eroded marble names, toy horse, architect's fiancée, answered non-literally by notes' endurance amid inevitable fall. Final image reweights premise of joy's durability. No moralizing; ambiguity in permanence lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: surveyor's eye filters ruins as "Victorian bones," "interlaced absence." Rhythmic control modulates from stoic measures to hushed intensity. Stable limited third-person; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: each line weaves action, image, interiority (e.g., "silver lid resisting" advances multiple layers). Varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught in lyric mode. Minor thickness in "hushed blaze" repetition risks overwrite but serves tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: surveyor as "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" transforms ruin trope via inkwell notes in foundations. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes of oblivion vs. endurance. Inevitable hindsight from early "interlaced absence" to final sealing.</comment>
