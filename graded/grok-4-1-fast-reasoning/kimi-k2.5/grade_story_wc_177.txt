<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preserving the directive and surrendering to the path act vividly in the dream reversal; final renunciation of the bunker is earned via embodied preparation and ingestion costs. Interiority particularized through tactile details like wax softening in her palm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: seal's melting and her departure reconfigure watcher-to-walker stance with conceptual cost of dissolved vow. Dream shard taught early via wall etchings pays off legibly; orientation anchored in opening paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest constrain choices (vines "recognize her scent," withdraw in dream) and charge final image of electric green humming. Sensory hierarchy narrows under storm urgency to vibrations, steam, rain's ancient language.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcend directive's cage) signaled early tightens accumulatively via ingestion and dream reversal, narrowing to renunciation with legible cost in unsteady legs and ignored light patterns. Agency in brewing/lying down forecloses preservation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of directives decaying into path-chosen surrender emerges organically from particulars; final image of dancing over logs offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise via absorbed seal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("precisely playful" rhythms) stable in single close-third POV; diction modulates from jittered shadows to tapping rain in skull under stress, no elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wafer seal clutched... seemed to breathe" advances emotion/object/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels without loops or figurative muddle, even in dense dream.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Name "Foresight Hindsight" and "precisely playful" synthesis transform post-apoc trope into fresh inward transcendence; risky Accumulative lyricism heightens stakes via dream reversal without gimmickry.</comment>
