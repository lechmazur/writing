<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular through embodied micro-choices like pressing glass to chest, revealing hierarchy of values; contradictory impulses (scientific maintenance vs soul-seeking) act in scene; final renunciation of fear earned by buildup of stellar empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to shower as pattern break; CR closure in "vulnerability no longer a wound but an atmosphere" reconfigures isolation with felt emotional cost; orientation anchored early in observatory/night.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass as micro-setting constrains choices (filtering, catching light) and charges final image as compass; sensory selection (amber shadows, trembling glass) reflects POV urgency; spatial choreography coherent on deck/console.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kinship in descent) signaled early, tightens via shower forcing stance crystallization; agency in attention/dance forecloses fear-path with legible cost under textural lens; internal conflict weaves without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of power in surrender emerges organically from stellar debris images shifting to personal trajectory; final image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing; earned from particulars like burning non-essential mass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (stars as kin, descent intuition); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to primal dance; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at charged poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "scattering light like seeds" advances image/stake); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative density coherent in lyric pattern without muddle at peak shower beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor's neglect as nursery for surrender; yellow glass transforms tool to compass organically; risk-taking in lyric choreography heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
