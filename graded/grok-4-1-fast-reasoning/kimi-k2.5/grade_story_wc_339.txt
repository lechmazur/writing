<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Julian's analytic micro-choices (calculating 37Hz) reveal contradictory impulses toward precision and surrender; realization of letting go earned by prior Death camaraderie, with embodied cost in deliberate breathing on surface.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening discoveries to CR closure (snow globe message reconfigures holding-on as drowning); cost legible in captain's release and Julian's return of globe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains choices (tilted shelves, pressure on globe); recurring light refraction and snow flakes charge final surfacing image, filtered through analytic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock transmission) tightens accumulatively at 37Hz vibration, forcing renunciation (return globe); agency in harmonic adjustments drives escalation with felt cost of untethering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of surrender's physics emerges from particulars (copper filament, captain's voice); final image of surfacing reweights premise without moral, resonant via globe's reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with analytic perceptual signature (wave equations, specific gravity of grief); rhythmic diction modulates from precise to poised without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in action-integrated details; minor figurative density (physics metaphors) in peak unlock risks overload but supports voice without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library as elegiac archive transforms wreck tropes via snow globe physics; risk of poetic conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in analytic surrender arc.</comment>
