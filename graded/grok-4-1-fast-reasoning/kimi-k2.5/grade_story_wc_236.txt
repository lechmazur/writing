<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in visual mapping of loss ("breath fogged and cleared"), with contradictory impulses (scent nostalgia vs. new noticing) driving micro-choices like examining screw; final perceptual shift earned with visible cost of "change in medium."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from gear exam to screw discovery to reassembly realization; CR closure lands on-page ("ordinary miracle... in the noticing") with conceptual cost of reweighted loss, fog lifting as resonant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog, water chambers, and loupe constrain choices (e.g., "occluded view through milky glass" transforms screw), charging final image of lifting fog mirroring clarity; sensory hierarchy (visual primacy post-smell loss) perfectly POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveiling miracles sans smell) signaled early, deepens via screw discovery narrowing to new language of "visible drips"; agency in patient repair/endurance forecloses scent-path with felt cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss as "change in medium" emerges organically from particulars (screw's birth-time link, clock drips); final image non-literally answers "humanizing the world" question, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (refraction/distortion noticing); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density, elisions (e.g., imagined midwife hands) taught early and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images ("silver comma suspended in amniotic fluid"); purposeful repetition (fog, drips, occluded) taught as pattern, but minor metaphor density slightly muddles peak reflection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory loss, water clocks, and birthing screw transforms adaptation trope; risk in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes of noticing, inevitable in hindsight via screw-time-birth motif.</comment>
