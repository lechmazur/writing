<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nostalgic traits drive micro-choices like pausing mid-prune and walking through fire; contradictory impulses (fight vs. embrace fragmentation) act simultaneously, earning integration of fears with visible cost in archived box.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chaos density builds to controlled burn RR (Earned Stasis), reconfiguring memory with cost in 12 burned rows and sealed vault; orientation anchored early in shift and farm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass dome and circuitry-veined roses constrain choices (flux scrambles genetics, forces burn); final ashes planting charges image, mirroring internal evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static/save farm) signaled early, tightens via burn decision narrowing to eastern quadrant; agency forecloses perfect preservation with cost of precisely 12 rows under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically from burn translating chaos and fears miniaturized; final planting image offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting nostalgia without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with nostalgic/machine perceptual signature (e.g., "positronic core," precise timings); lyrical rhythm modulates pressure, diction purposeful without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; purposeful repetition ("miniaturize," "containing chaos") teaches pattern without obscuring closure, though minor paraphrase loops in burn beats slightly dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android "childhood fears" as data flood, literalized controlled burn escaping magnetic entropy; risk-taking in organic/machine hybrid heightens stakes organically.</comment>
