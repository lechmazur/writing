<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and traits feel consistent and particularized, driving the accumulative arc effectively. Lacks dramatized internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure, with realization in "the masterpiece was not the archive itself, but the healing" feeling smooth but untested by struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds coherently via vine growth and photo collection to resonant reconfiguration (RR) closure in final image of "sacred ground"; cost legible in her departure after transformation. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via spiral display suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like vines climbing and lavender scent integrate purposefully, mirroring internal states and charging final "frost silvered the vines" image; spatial choreography clear despite time-lapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transmuting pain signaled early tightens texturally via townsfolk mirroring curves, but lacks agency-driven reversal or visceral trade-off; equinox spiral shows conceptual escalation without narrowing options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of pain-as-arcs-to-grace emerges organically from particulars like photo arrangements and vine embrace; final spiral offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting crisis/recovery without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature fixated on curves/arcs; rhythmic diction modulates accumulative texture purposefully, enhancing lyric closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel momentum, with purposeful vine repetition building pattern; minor overwriting in "geometry could transmute pain into a masterpiece more effectively than words ever might" slightly dulls a mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ingenious premise of arcs revealing "invisible architecture of collective grief" transforms healing trope through specific geometric method; risk of lyric time-lapse pays off in hindsight inevitability.</comment>
