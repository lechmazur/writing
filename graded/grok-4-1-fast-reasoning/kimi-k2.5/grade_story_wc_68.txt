<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the "agonize" paragraph, balancing ego-driven myth-making against rational observation of councils' power abuse; final renunciation of surfacing is earned through cog-handling micro-choices with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from water-drinking to cog discovery to sketching; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in final image of unmoved papers amid rising tide, with legible cost of flood-trusting endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sewer micro-setting (rust water, calcified walls, rising tide) constrains choices throughout, charging final image where cog gleams as "small sun" against flood; sensory hierarchy (taste of rust, bell-tone ripple) reflects Elias's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve precision vs. mythic confusion) signaled early, deepens decisively via cog discovery narrowing to underground rebellion; agency in endurance forecloses surfacing with war-over-memory cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically as geological strata compressing to "diamond of unbearable density"; final sketching reconfigures premise non-literally, reweighting chaos-praise with precision's verifiable north, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in geological metaphors ("sedimentary layers," "ribcage of a concrete leviathan"); rhythmic control modulates from calm description to charged poise in ending without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax, but minor motif repetition ("abrasive calm" x2) borders paraphrase loop without full payoff; no artifacts dull closure image of gleaming cog and rising water.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh post-plague world blaming clocks transforms trope via sewer philosopher's cog excavation; risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens stakes through layered rebellion without gimmickry.</comment>
