<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's guarded traits drive micro-choices like assuming the border-wars stance amid tightening vortex, revealing contradictory serenity vs. chaos with embodied cost in her "guarded heart unbent just enough to feel sorrow." Interiority concrete via vial's warmth and katas; final endurance forecloses forceful taking. Minor slip in abstract "warlike serenity crystallized in her bones," but 9+ test met via on-page impulses and earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oriented early ("Elara stood at the water's edge"); situational lens holds as vortex pressure forces stance crystallization, causal linkages via ripple-sync entry to seed-release climax. Closure as RR (Charged Poise in calm-water walk) with conceptual cost (truth's angle revealed, lake freed). Cost legible in "sorrow" and empty vial readiness; no orientation debt, lens clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting (crystal vial, ice block) constrains choices—seed pierces stagnation; recurring circles charge final image of expanding ripples to shore. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (druid notices roots/rot, thresholds); choreography coherent (inward pull to frozen air). 9+ test met via vortex constraining katas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal hidden truth) signaled early, tightens situationally as "vortex resisted, tightening its spiral" forces stillness renunciation over force. Agency in katas nullifies chaos; cost visible in seed consumption and heart-sorrow. Escalation coherent under situational lens to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (illusions reverse truth's direction) emerges from particulars: mirror-trick failure → inward spin → outward unbending via circles. Final CR reweights premise (lake imprisoned, not cursed) without moralizing, resonant in orchard settling. Subtext in confession gasp; 9+ test met via non-literal ending answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (threshold-keeper notices "moments trapped between heartbeats"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates (slow-motion sabers to steam gasp). No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early (ripples/vortex pattern) pays off legibly. Under stress, syntax tightens consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate action/atmosphere (e.g., "branches whipped past with the sound of sabers drawn in slow motion"). Varied rhythm, no loops; minor overwrites in stacked metaphors ("green tornado of roots and rot") but coherent/voice-motivated, not obscuring closure. Propulsion peaks at seed germination.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: physics of circles/spin direction + flesh-seed vs. ice ingeniously transforms curse trope into perceptual revelation. Risky stillness amid violence heightens stakes; irreplaceable "unbend" logic inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold perceptual ingenuity.</comment>
