<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied visions and ache of displacement; micro-choice of giving valve earns change with relational cost. Reactively visionary trait shows contradictory impulses in processing vs. acting. Woman's pressure reveals Kael's values without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artifact collection densifies to CR closure where loss becomes legible via valve's reprise. Orientation anchored early in harbor post-exile. One tightening via woman interaction narrows to shared meaning; cost felt in "navigated absences."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's wet luminescence and driftwood constrain searches, mirroring internal absences; valve as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory details (salt-crusted, ocean-spray) filter through archivist bias. No white-room; evolves with light shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile meaning) signaled early, accumulates density to woman's encounter tightening via relational test. Agency in handling artifacts forecloses isolation; cost legible in displacement ache and endurance. Coheres under accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of assembling meaning from fragments emerges via valve's shift from failure to connection, reweighting absences without moralizing. Final image of woman wearing valve answers exile's erosion non-literally. Subtext in silences and implications avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in visionary bursts; diction modulates from clarity to stuttered visions. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("It waited for you"); distinct voices. No head-hopping; rhythm fits accumulative poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("staggered intervals," "compile fragments into meaning") creates minor loops dulling propulsion in reflective beats (−0.6). High density in visions; rhythm varies but template echoes in artifact lists. Closure image clear despite overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visionary archivist in post-exile rebuild transforms absence trope via tactile fragments. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. No derivatives; valve's evolution feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
