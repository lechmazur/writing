<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied sensations like "rough linen dragged across wet skin"; final integration of urn earns change with conceptual cost of archived existence. Contradictory impulses in hoarding vs. embracing timelessness act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragmented timekeeping to CR closure where urn dissolves, reweighting premise with cost of sovereign continuity over borrowed increments. Orientation anchored early; pattern pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald silo and urn constrain choices (breach extraction) and charge final image (dissolving into chest); sensory details like "oxidized verdant hue" and "smells like grandmother's unfulfilled promises" filter through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) signaled early, escalates via textural density to pressing urn—agency forecloses fragmented existence with legible cost in "endless texture of the moment." One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as accumulative fabric emerges organically from particulars like garage ads and urn; final image ("traced the urn's absence") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (temporal textures, numbers as colors); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, prose-as-character reflects timekeeper's mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language consistent and pattern-taught (time metaphors), propels to closure without muddle in peak beat of urn dissolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time fracture via garage-sale codes and urn as "concentrated chronology"; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, feels inevitable in emerald silo climax.</comment>
