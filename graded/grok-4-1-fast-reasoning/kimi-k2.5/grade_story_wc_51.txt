<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in whalebone reverie state; motivation consistent and intensifies through annual ritual. Final endurance as vessel earned by weaving process. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal calcification beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from paralysis to calcification clarity. CR closure in "boundary-lessly trapped nature momentarily clarified" with conceptual cost of purposeful imprisonment legible in final dreaming image. Orientation anchored immediately; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bronze grotto constrains choices via starlight alignment and northern aperture; dust motes and fissures charge calcification beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects weaver's priorities. Final grotto exhale recharges setting as living entity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (calcify fractals to escape recursion) signaled early; accumulative density tightens to completion with agency in orienting/weaving. Cost felt in clarified entrapment foreclosing escape. No reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of form from formlessness emerges via sorrows-to-weights; final rosary image offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moral. Particulars drive complexity. No overt statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with fractal-perceptual signature in noticing threads-between-moments. Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; motifs purposeful without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in "shingled hush" repetitions dull mid-beat slightly. No artifacts touch closure; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal-weaving sorrows into weights transforms recursion trope. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; bold voice commits to premise. Final exhale image heightens ingenuity.</comment>
