<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is embodied and particular, with contradictory impulses in her abdication; Mara applies relational pressure. Final renunciation earned by prior climb and commands. Minor epiphanic summary at "mystery unraveled itself" slightly abstracts peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dreams/climb to grotto realization. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. CR closure on-page ("abdication and rebirth") with conceptual cost of renounced power; pool-reaching image makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (wind's "rot and ending," pulsing walls) filter through Elara's priorities, constraining choices like climb and pool-touch. Grotto cobalt menace transforms to workshop, charging final image; fireflies reweight sky/earth gap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream unraveling) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via grotto/Mara/pool to renunciation. Agency in commands/reach forecloses earthly rule with felt abdication cost. One deepening suffices; no reversal overload needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice-weaving emerges organically from bleeding light to new patterns, without statement. Final pool act reweights dreams from dread to purpose non-literally. Fireflies bridge ambiguity with resonant cost of power-loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (commanding elements, tasting whispers). Voice texture poetic/rhythmic, modulating intensity; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("dreams never yours alone"). No head-hopping; diction fits lyric fantasy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via image-chains, but figurative overload ("cobwebs of silver dread... liquid light") borders coherence strain in opening climb beat without full pattern-teach early. No loops; rhythm varies, closure image sharp. Minor scaffold in reflective phrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of queenly fall into cosmic-weaving; lacy menace to firefly bridge transforms prophecy trope boldly. Risky lyric escalation heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without gimmick.</comment>
