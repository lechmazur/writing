<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interior reverence and students' embodied tremors (e.g., miner's daughter's hands) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure, earning their harmonious shift. Students feel particular despite archetypal roles, with micro-choices like damping strings showing value hierarchy. Minor slip in refugee's backstory feeling expository slightly undercuts immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to students' playing, landing Charged Poise closure in final harmony with cost of unlearned grievances legible in "looking at one another not as enemies." Orientation anchored early (library, students introduced). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn light selectively constrain mood and choices (shadows across zither heighten stillness); rosette as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory details (plucked strings hanging like incense) reflect Elias's priorities without catalog. No generic placeholders; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation via subtraction) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through students' tentative playing to harmony, narrowing options with agency in omission. Felt cost in trembling restraint and risk of failure charges peak. One deepening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-through-absence emerges from rosette's "gaps" and final music without statement; resonant answer in students' shared gaze reweights premise. Subtext in silences and restraint avoids morals. Particulars like "subtracting noise" build complexity organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (Elias notices rosette's pulse, traveled stillness); lyrical diction modulates rhythmically to pressure. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven ("The rosette marks the silence"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful repetition ("subtracting noise") taught as pattern without loops obscuring cause. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "incense or memory") slightly dulls peak plucking but closure image clear. No scaffolds or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music as reconciliation map (rosette's absences) transforms war-torn tropes; risk in quiet subtraction heightens stakes organically. Final image inevitable from early pattern, no derivatives.</comment>
