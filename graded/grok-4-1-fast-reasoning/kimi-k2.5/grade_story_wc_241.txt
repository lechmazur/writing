<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via embodied tremors and heartbeat tempo; contradictory impulses act in scene as math rigor meets scrawl surrender, earning final teaching shift with mortality cost. Father's legacy flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scrawls and reflections densify to CR closure: candle guttering reconfigures probability as fractured grace, cost legible in "losing could also be a form of necessary, lucid grace." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rainwashed library and mica lantern constrain choices (slow climb, light-fracture observation) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (humid paper, drumming storm) reflects post-heart urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (widening perspectives via scrawls) deepens accumulatively through calculations and storm cadence, forcing endurance of contradictions with heart-cost legibility; one tightening suffices but minor abstractness tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of disciplined uncertainty emerges from particulars like mica ghosts and scrawls, resonating non-literally in final walk without moralizing; counter-readings (father's failure vs. survival) embrace complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (probability in clovers, mutations); rhythmic modulation peaks in "mica splitting the flame into four distinct ghosts," distinct from generic lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "lucid contradiction"/"fracture" (e.g., repeated in library beats) dull closure image slightly; no heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gambler-math legacy via scrawl curriculum transforms introspection trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
