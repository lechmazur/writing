<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Characterization strong with embodied emotions (trembling fingers, gasp at root release) and earned change via scar alignment compelling higher stakes; relationship crucible forces mutual release. Minor flaw: "purposefully curious nature finally rewarded" diagnostic label-speak at pivotal realization dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure ("let's dream carefully" crystallizes duty with profound binding cost legible in final image). Orientation anchored early (~50 words); tightening via Kael's "eclipsed" realization reweights options without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glade constrains choices (roots anchor Elara until scar circuit, glade rotates paths); dusk light stretches impossibly, charging final node image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hummed trees, ink shadows), integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rewrite timeline) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via root release and clipping burn narrowing to node entry; agency in joining hands forecloses paths with felt relational cost ("bound more profoundly").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of scarred restoration emerges organically from events (scars merge agonies into strength), final image reweights eclipse premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance in stacked realities invites ambiguity on temporal negotiation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature poetic/selective (bruised sky in eyes); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("heed the warning in your eyes") advances plot. Diction modulates intensity consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload in peak beats ("shadows pooled like ink," "realities stacked like translucent pages") muddles coherence without pattern payoff; minor paraphrase loop in "anxious elation" repetitions dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal scars and topiary maze transforms tropes (eclipsed covenant reweights future-arrival premise); risk in rotating glade heightens stakes organically.</comment>
