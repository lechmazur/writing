<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—from suturing wounds via surgeries to opening them via descent—act simultaneously; final witnessing choice earned by telepathic urges and ring-reading, with embodied cost in screaming nerves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perceptual density tightens from waking clarity to cavern CR; shattered hourglass makes binding cost legible in final image, with persistent constraint via roots/hourglass.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower roots and cavern meteor constrain descent choice; geological coffee rings on floor recharge waking motif, charging scar-alphabet closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to reverse miracle deepens texturally via plants/telepathy into scar-reading; descent agency forecloses closure path with on-page perceptual cost, reweighting options at cavern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scars-as-alphabets reconfigures displaced miracle premise through ring/frost images; final touch/shatter offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("meteor hush," ring constellations) biases toward stone/scar noticing; rhythmic control heightens descent pressure, stable POV intimacy intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to cavern; scar/ring metaphors cohere purposefully without muddle or loops, though figurative weight slightly taxes peak descent propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cosmic scar-reading and plant-telepathy synthesize miracle tropes into fresh textural arc; cavern payoff inevitable from early rings, bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
