<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority embodied and particular (teeth humming with infrasound), motivation intensifies via jar releases earning surrender; minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "poverty was not punishment but preparation" abstracts contradiction without full micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening per jar release to CR closure (ash burial reconfigures life with conceptual cost of anonymity/fertility); oriented early (obsidian sand, jars by ~50 words), single scene coherent, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (black sand voids suspend bioluminescence, volcano hush invites releases) and charges final image (ash rain on warm sand); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (sulfur boots, bug Morse), selective/evolving with cosmic sync.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of transformation) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening realizations per jar narrowing to renunciation; cost legible in "empty hands now cupped to catch the falling ash," agency in releases forecloses control path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of alchemy (sand to glass, giving to keeping) emerges organically from releases/images, resonant CR in final surrender without moralizing; earned via particulars, though "giving everything away had been the only way to keep it" borders echo (−0.2).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (geological/biological fusion: "helical patterns matching double-helix"), rhythmic control modulates hush to crescendo; stable close-POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early/legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload in release beats (e.g., "light-poetry that spelled out words in extinct languages," "microscopic gears") risks coherence without full pattern payoff (−0.6); no loops, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bugs/volcano/prophet reweights tropes (philanthropy as catalysis) inevitably; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, no derivative echoes, closure feels organic/non-obvious.</comment>
