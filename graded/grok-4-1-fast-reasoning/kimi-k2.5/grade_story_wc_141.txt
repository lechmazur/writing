<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's myth-busting skepticism contradicts her pull toward wonder, embodied in lifting and playing the cello despite denial; internal conflict acts simultaneously in the playing beat. Final renunciation of skepticism feels earned via prior micro-choices like reimagining memory during the bow strokes. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphanies ("her career... had been the real fiction") borders diagnostic without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as motifs (shell, cello, fog) densify toward CR closure in shell cracking and cliff-edge step, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of dissolved skepticism legible in "ready to reimagine everything." Orientation anchors immediately in observatory/cliff/shell. Single scene coherent, no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's shattered telescopes and rusted charts constrain via spatial choreography to cello's center, charging final image as dust shakes and she steps to cliff edge. Sensory details (boots crunching glass, bow hums into granite) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal decay-to-beauty shift. Micro-object (cello/shell) as setting evolves causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle via persistence post-ending) signaled in opening, escalates accumulatively as playing tightens pressure, shell spins/cracks narrowing skepticism to acceptance. Agency in bow strokes forecloses myth-busting path with felt cost in "skepticism finally dissolved." One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transforming stories emerges organically from particulars (half-finished cello as incomplete songs, shell's map), culminating in resonant CR: "every ending is just a compass pointing toward the next beginning." No direct statement; ambiguity lingers in fog-walk invitation to reread. Protagonist arc inextricable from riddle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (e.g., "gloomy cheerfulness settled... like a familiar blanket") modulates rhythmically with intensity, stable single POV. Purposeful compression in reimagining beats taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue; diction biased to myth/science tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., cello's "weight of incomplete songs" advances motif/character/action); rhythm varies read-aloud. Figurative density in playing beat ("resonant hums shaking dust... echoing through the wood") overwrites slightly without muddle, but repeated "reimagined" stems near loop. Clean grammar, no scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: myth-buster retells via cello hums in story-ending timeframe transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes in fog-disappearance echo without gimmick. Final CR inevitable from shell/cello particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
