<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's retrocognitive visions and pattern-seeking create concrete interior contradiction, embodied in temple pressure and trembling hands at climax. Final validation earns a meaningful change with felt cost of decades' solitary vigil. Contradictory longing for understanding drives micro-choices like climbing the tower.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions and coincidences densify to prism revelation and star alignment. Closure RR (beacon ignites, distant glints answer) lands on-page with conceptual cost of reversed endings legible in unraveling light. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Glass pavilion's hum and fractures constrain climb and prism placement, evolving to resonant chord at climax. Sensory selectivity (tremor, wind-song, gold threads) mirrors urgency; thistle final image charges closure. Micro-setting (console, tower spiral) tactilely lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove pattern meaning) signaled early, tightens via prism unlocking star timing under accumulative lens. Agency in positioning prism forecloses doubt path; cost in vigil burden felt in empty-yet-full hands. Escalation coheres to charged poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of masked coherence emerges organically from spiraling debris, clustered visions, and beacon answer. Final thistle image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting chaos with hope's root-taking cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in "might be found" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via backward echoes and star syntax biases noticing. Rhythmic control modulates from hum's hush to chord's radiance without head-hopping. Compression purposeful and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., prism facets "catching darkness"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language consistent in lyric mode without muddle at "prism home" climax. Zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms post-apoc custodian trope via retrocognitive lexicon and Thornwheel alignment into inevitable synthesis. "Shard of hush" and thistle callback risk poetic boldness heightening stakes organically. No derivative echoes; fresh conceptual integrity.</comment>
