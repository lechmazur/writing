<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's embodied trauma (trembling fingers, freeze) and micro-choices (observing rather than fighting the freeze) reveal contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final thaw into "conscious motion" with smile at photo is earned by somatic progression, foreclosing denial with acceptance cost. Quiet talent shown precisely in grafting and planting resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from tending to wind-triggered memory to thawing realization; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in photo opening/smile with felt cost of confronted loss. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in arboretum/cliff. Lens holds firmly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum constrains via wind/salt (roots clutching like Elias's grip), charges final cypress-edge moment and photo thaw. Sensory hierarchy (teeth ache from wind frequency, light through needles) reflects botanical/somatic bias. Micro-setting (soil, saplings) mirrors internal cultivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate stillness amid grief) signaled early, deepens texturally via somatic freeze to deliberate thaw narrowing denial path. Agency in endurance/observation forecloses escape with cost in "acceptance that the wedding had happened, that the strike had happened." Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of growth/resistance emerges organically from human hands vs. automation/machines of destruction; final photo smile non-literally answers optimism-as-denial vs. realism. Pearl motif reweights irritant to luminous without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like oyster calcification ties arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with somatic/botanical perceptual signature (e.g., "somatic marker that tightened his throat"). Rhythmic control modulates from freeze suspension to thawing propulsion; purposeful compression in reflections legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/reflection (e.g., "fingers... moved through the needles"); varied rhythm breathes with emotional beats, no loops or artifacts. Figurative layer (pearl, roots) purposeful without muddle in peak thaw. Propulsion peaks cleanly at "He smiled at the image, small and real."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone grief, botanical existentialism, and automation obsolescence transforms survivor trope via somatic cultivation. Risky lyric reflection heightens stakes without obscuring; pearl/cypress images inevitable in hindsight. Bold human-vs-machine angle feels singular.</comment>
