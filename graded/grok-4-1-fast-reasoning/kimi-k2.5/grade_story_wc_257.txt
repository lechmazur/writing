<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in loss, embodied in stained fingers and precise folds, compelling her to guide the young man through projection; contradictory calm exterior hides burning drive. Internal conflict surfaces in teaching impermanence without theatricality. Young man's hollow voice tests her, forcing micro-choices that earn his transformation. Final calibration of instruments by rock bottom anchors earned stasis with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from rituals to projection climax where stencil merges stars, parting curtains for RR/Charged Poise; young man's recognition reconfigures grief as gateway. Orientation anchors Elara/observatory early. Closure lands on-page: his departure and her vellum selection recharge prior patterns with endurance cost in polished reflection. Persistent constraint of dying stars shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory dome and projector constrain rituals, charging projection where stencil overlays brother's stars. Vellum and magnets tactilely guide choices; fossilized wood mirrors internal decay-to-bloom. Sensory hierarchy (sepia ink, copper rotation) biases through Elara's archivist eye. Final image of fresh vellum against dying stars recharges setting with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief signaled in cranes; young man's arrival deepens via projection reversal, narrowing to eternal return pattern aligning stars. Agency in her rotation/pinning forces his stance crystallization. Cost legible in trembling hands to folded crane departure, foreclosing raw pain path. Lens escalation via textural density suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of artificial memorials as truth emerges via interlocking circles and star alignment, reweighting loss as cartography without statement. Subtext in "genuinely artificial" dialogue implies via projection payoff. Final crane on threshold answers withering-to-bloom non-literally, lingering ambiguity in manufactured permanence. No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in "curtains of intention" and ink-stained precision biases noticing. Voice texture rhythmic, modulating subdued ardor to warming air. Dialogue subtextual ("This is genuinely artificial"), goal-driven, distinct idiom. No head-hopping; elision of backstory paid in calibration image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense propulsion: sentences layer image/action (vellum pinned, dome rotated) without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies for ear, peaking in "face transform" projection. Figuratives purposeful (translucent veils), no muddle. Final line recharges motifs cleanly, zero artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of observatory as grief cartography, stencils projecting extinct stars onto personal loss transforms tropes organically. Risk in timeless nonlinear light/coordinates heightens stakes via hybrid map. Inevitable hindsight: rock bottom calibrates ascent architecture. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
