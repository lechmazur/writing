<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under subtle pressure, like breathing to cultivate "sharp gentleness"; motivation intensifies credibly to earned renunciation of interference. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak scene beats, leaning meditative over conflicted. Final sitting and leaving glass feels earned but without rawer flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from sun patterns to lantern spectra revealing timelines, landing CR closure in leaving glass as beacon with felt cost of non-disturbance. Orientation anchored early in oasis at dawn. No causality breaks; persistent constraint of thrumming shapes revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (vibrations in teeth/throat, contradictory shadows) filters through Kai's priorities, constraining choices like inclining lavender. Recurring lantern glass charges final image as new beacon. Atmosphere tensions wasteland entropy against oasis devotion seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening revelations (bees' net across time, lantern beams splitting spectra) narrowing to acceptance. Agency in raising glass forces trade-off of non-interference with visible cost in leaving it. One decisive intensification suffices; cost legible in "would not take honey... set the lantern glass upon the central hive stand."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resistance as devotion emerges organically from bee consciousness and timelines, reweighted in final image of thrumming many nows without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to central question via lantern left as beacon. Complexity lingers in illusion of change, tied to Kai's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: noticing sun patterns contradicting light, fractured doublings. Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically ("precise as a blade, soft as ash"), purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to zen potter lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture or insight, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (kintsugi fractures splitting spectra) without muddle in peak beats. Minor register elevation fits lyrical voice; rhythm varies naturally, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of zen bees weaving time-nets in wasteland oasis transforms tropes boldly; lantern kintsugi as timeline reveal inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise fully.</comment>
