<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in activating sworn-forbidden protocols amid vibrating equipment, earning the tether choice with embodied guilt as cost; interiority concrete via "dissonant chord that had screamed beneath her ribs."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from cabinet/letters to temporal fold; on-page closure as "younger Elara to turn back" delivers resonant reconfiguration with timeline regret cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lab's quantum equipment and glass dome under meteor hush constrain tether attempt, charging insect's twitch in amber as final anchor; sensory hierarchy sound-biased via "firmware...wail...through bone-conduction."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to resolve guilt escalates via pattern break as cries translate to forgiveness, forcing agency in air-etching; cost unmistakable in "collapsing the wave function of regret" foreclosing abandonment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Baby cries resolving to forgiveness reweights lost sounds theme non-literally; amber insect's completed flight offers resonant answer to memory/guilt question via particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("sound seemed vacuumed...time folded like heavy origami"); rhythmic control heightens pressure without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "etched a new constellation—not on skin, but across the surface of the folding air" propels closure with varied rhythm, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Time-tether via sound-tattoos and amber firmware synthesizes fresh premise organically; risk of folding timelines heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via guilt-haunted circuits.</comment>
