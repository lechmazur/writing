<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's erasure drives concrete micro-choices like speaking "Mara" aloud and reaching into the canvas; interiority embodied in "touching smoke that remembers it was once bone." Contradictory grief/exhaustion anchors feel particular; final unfastening earned with visible cost in loosened tethers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lens raise to eternal instant expansion, revelation of hidden nanny, climax unfastening, CR closure as "painting now altered... in collective memory" with cost in hot lens and elusively tangible touch. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rope bridges and wind constrain stance, mirroring suspended stakes; market frozen mid-gesture charges eternal instant. Lens fragment as micro-setting handled tactilely, refracting rainbows into final sway; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (grief's weight, exhaustion's hue). Rooftop height subtly parallels unfastening from oblivion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to honor overlooked history signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hidden details revelation and name-speaking that loosens anchors. Agency in reaching through canvas forecloses obscurity with cost in "flood of sensory memory" and hot lens; pressure coheres to Charged Poise reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bridging overlooked histories emerges organically from particulars like lace-encoded name and ghosted hands; final image of altered collective memory offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting brushstrokes' weight without moralizing. Subtext in painter's compassion layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition") stable in single close-third POV; rhythm modulates from setup to peak compression in unfastening beat. No dialogue; purposeful repetition taught early, legible at closure; diction reflects translator's liminal mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (long suspended sentences to short releases); purposeful patterned repetition ("elusively tangible") taught early without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in reflective phrases ("between childhood and now") slightly dull mid-section propulsion, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical market, lens refraction, and painting as memory-prison transforms ghost-story tropes; unfastening via hidden details feels inevitable from setup. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick; premise commits to elusively tangible rules throughout.</comment>
