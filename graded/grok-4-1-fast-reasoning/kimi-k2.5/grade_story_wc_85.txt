<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to measure "the weight of a withheld truth" drives concrete micro-choices like raw-handed sifting; contradictory impulses peak in rejecting redemption yet bearing witness via arrangement, earning closure stasis with embodied cost in bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as carving discoveries densify to CR closure in "specific gravity of his crimes," reweighting forgery premise; orientation anchored instantly in terrace/watch hand; no lens ambiguity, cost legible in final row and watch punctuation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and driftwood constrain sifting ritual, charging final gallery image; dusk progression (bruised sky to stars) mirrors internal settling, sensory hierarchy (salt-splinters, wood grain) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (life's unlived weight) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via final carving find narrowing to witness-role crystallization; cost felt in "tempered regret settling into his bones," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of persistent truth emerges via carvings defying forgery, resonant CR in wooden lineage unbroken; final image reweights premise without moralizing, subtext in "sieved hush" deepening ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "sieved hush" and wood-curl noticing; rhythmic modulation (short dusk sentences to expansive close) heightens pressure, diction biased to forger's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands raw from salt and splinters" advances action/embodiment); purposeful "weight" recurrence taught early avoids loops; minor fig lang density in opener contained, propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of black-market genealogy via driftwood totems transforms redemption trope; risk in poetic conceit ("specific gravity") inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
