<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation fuses commerce with ambition for insight-empathy fusion, embodied in static prickling and final commitment; contradictory detachment yields to wonder at "authentic wonder," earning change with cost of craft uncertainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from vial arrangement to grotto resonance; on-page CR at "counterfeit had become real" reconfigures half-truths with conceptual cost in "feeling will fade by morning" uncertainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber grotto's resinous walls and static constrain sensing and catalyze anomaly, charging closure; sensory hierarchy via Kael's professional priors vivid from opening "resinous walls glowing."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of empathy sans understanding tightens via resonance anomaly reweighting options; client agency in petal use forecloses fear with felt cost in resin tears, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Half-truths to wholes emerges via petal evolution and resin tears image, reweighting premise without moral; resonant non-literal answer in Kael's vow ties to central fusion question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in static-bodied noticing; dialogue subtextual ("half truth I sell you") advances goal, rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (silk around knife) integrated into action; no loops, propulsion peaks in "static electricity coalesced into visible arcs," varying rhythm flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synthetic emotions, amber resonance, static sensing transforms alchemy trope organically; risk in anomaly payoff inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes inventively.</comment>
