<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Singing from "pure logarithmic calculation...infused with every memory" marries logical-emotional duality at climax, earning decisive choice with embodied cost (trembling hands, racing pulse).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: accidental broadcast → shadows hunt → sprint/activate → sonic resolution as DC; cost legible in "body shaking with the aftermath," reconfiguring boundary with price paid on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice constrains flight ("could not outrun them across the shifting ice plates"), fresnel lens catches sunset to charge final image of saved marina settling into darkness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect key) tightens via realization of "sonic absolution," forcing song agency that forecloses fight/flight; shadows clawing base escalates under causal lens with on-page cost (harmonic release shakes her).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of flesh/spirit union emerges implicitly through key's "second heartbeat" to song's forgiveness, final glowing key reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as "thrumming against her palm"); rhythmic modulation builds to climax intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density peaks overwrought in climax ("liquify the air into visible ripples") without obscuring closure; no loops, scaffold clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sonic absolution via engineered song transforms lighthouse trope into fresh causal ingenuity, risking ethereal physics that heightens stakes organically to inevitable close.</comment>
