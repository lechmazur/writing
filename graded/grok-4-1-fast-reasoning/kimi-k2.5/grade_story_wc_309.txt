<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels with Elias's contradictory impulses—ignoring algorithmic corrections while tracing mist patterns—culminating in an earned renunciation at the keystone embrace; motivation rooted in underachievement intensifies organically without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from monitoring to keystone discovery and final CR closure ("He embraced the stone as the gantry dissolved"); orientation anchored early, cost legible in forfeiture of safety metrics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via mist-walking negotiation and gantry dissolution, charging final image of exposed keystone weathering storms; keystone's warmth pocket mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (obsolescence vs. human purpose) tightens at irregularity spotting and unstrapping, with agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "unstrapped his certification seals" foreclosing mechanical return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacred imperfection emerges implicitly from keystone's "asymmetrical flourishes" vs. automated symmetry, resonant CR in sightings and chisel sounds reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person perceptual bias (e.g., "lingering luminance warming his skin where the machine cold could not reach") with rhythmic modulation under stress; no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in dimming shift beat slightly risks coherence without obscuring closure; no loops or scaffolds dulling pivotal embrace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated magic vs. human relic in keystone's "hand-hewn spirals," transforming obsolescence trope through Accumulative CR; risk-taking in lyric closure heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
