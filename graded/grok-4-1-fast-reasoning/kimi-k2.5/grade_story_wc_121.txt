<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority particular through embodied sensations like trembling hands and burning tablet; unification earned via procedural steps with felt cost of integrating ghost selves. Contradictory impulses in fractured timelines act in scene, driving micro-choices like committing weight to void steps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via procedural path generation narrowing to CR closure: tablet crumbles to tattoos, viaduct fades in unified acceptance with conceptual cost of embraced multiplicity legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct with bioluminescent algae and post-rain slickness constrains choices by procedurally generating underfoot; recurring "darkening brightness" paradox charges final image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-unification signaled early tightens accumulatively through deepening rune generations and collapsing timelines; agency in foot-committed descent forecloses non-integration path with visible cost in fading ghosts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of labyrinthine self emerges organically from procedural maze and multiplicity; final tattoos reweight premise non-literally as design over curse, lingering with ambiguity of infinite becoming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in squirming runes and pleading ghost hands; rhythmic prose modulates from hovering poise to descent intensity, diction biased toward quantum-fractured idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure beats (e.g., runes "squirmed like living things," "quantum foam") without consistent pattern payoff, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops in labyrinth motifs, but syntax varies rhythmically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Procedural generation of psyche-maze synthesizes fractured timelines and periodic eternity into fresh, inevitable CR; risk of lyric paradox ("darkening brightness") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
