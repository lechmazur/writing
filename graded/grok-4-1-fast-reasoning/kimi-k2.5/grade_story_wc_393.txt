<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in guilt compels micro-choices like confession and oath; contradictory impulses (doubting redemption yet seeking proof for Marcus) act in scene, earning final renunciation of past failure with ministry cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: entry due to 17-year burden leads to examination, inscription DC changes knowledge/options; CR closure lands on-page ("weight...shift from burden to purpose") with undeniable cost in "whatever remained of his ministry."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm/light constrains reveal (piercing windows illuminates inscription); sensory hierarchy (thunder/rain hush vs. brass gears) mirrors internal shift, evolving causally from violet desperation to ozone/possibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exonerate Marcus) signaled early, tightens via causal inscription reversal narrowing ignorance to action; agency in seeking repairman forces trade-off (3 weeks vs. ministry), cost felt in archival confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical redemption emerges via particulars (gears as mercy); final image ("Marcus's legacy would finally play its true melody") non-literally reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Elias POV with perceptual signature (rain-soaked hush as emotional filter); dialogue sparse/natural/subtextual (repairman's "I can fix this" advances goal); rhythmic modulation under revelation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density/propulsion, varied rhythm; deduct for patterned artifacts ("vibrant hush" x3, "aptly deliberate" x2) bordering loop in reflective beats, minor overwriting (e.g., "violet desperation") dulls peak reveal slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clockwork heart as innocence proof transforms wrongful execution trope via chaplain's arc; risk in poetic compression heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
