<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rebellious motivation rooted in spliced memories drives concrete micro-choices like exploiting blind spots; embodied conflict in stinging palms and synchronized heartbeat culminates in earned stasis of endurance despite dissipation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as drumming density builds to frequency alignment and summoning; Charged Poise closure lands with legible cost in "hand dissipating into harmonic mist" and final perseverance image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sonic willows and seed pods constrain drumming tactics and mirror escalation; auric lagoon as micro-setting charges climax formation and final shimmer, filtering through Kael's harmonic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrection tightens via rhythmic escalation to figure's emergence then ventilation rupture; agency in faster drumming forces trade-off with visceral cost in slumped failure.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grief-as-entanglement emerges organically through shared rhythms; final "auroral sorrow... blanket" image offers resonant reconfiguration of loss as beautiful distance versus lost warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sonic perceptual signature (e.g., "sympathetic hum... like electricity") stable in single POV; rhythmic syntax modulates intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in percussive phrasing propels momentum; metaphors cohere (e.g., "sound wave garden... aurora") without muddle, varied rhythm passes read-aloud test through climax.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quantum grief mapped as sonic resurrection transforms sci-fi tropes via drumming navigation; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at shimmering perseverance.</comment>
