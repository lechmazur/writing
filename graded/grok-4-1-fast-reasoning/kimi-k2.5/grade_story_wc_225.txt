<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "fingers moved with fierce repose, calm in their intensity," earning the mirror realization as a credible endurance of guilt without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through thread insertions to CR closure at "puzzle clicked... mirror showing the move," with legible cost of "years believing he held the power" reweighted on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suspended "snowflake and arrested breath" plus platinum labyrinth constrain decoding choices and charge mirror image, filtering through Kaelen's geometric priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of absolution tightens accumulatively via final thread insertion narrowing self-loathing options; mirror forces stance crystallization with felt cost of misplaced agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of decoding "essential mistake" from debris emerges organically, resonating in tapestry touch unfreezing time without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via "geometric pathways" and chess-endgame lens sustains tight third-person limited POV, modulating rhythm with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in peak decoding; minor repetition of "woven hush" teaches pattern without loop, though slight figurative density borders overwrite in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth-tapestry synthesis transforms chess-exile trope into fresh CR, with risk-taking in frozen-time stasis heightening ingenuity toward inevitable mirror repricing.</comment>
