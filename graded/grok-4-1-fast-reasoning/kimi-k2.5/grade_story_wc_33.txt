<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in persistence drives micro-choices like tracing empty slots and using the bottle precisely, with embodied tension ("hair stand on end"). Internal endurance forecloses direct confrontation path with felt risk/cost (rations, timing). Minor slip in late epiphanic summary ("memory survived digital erasure") borders unearned insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of absences builds to storm release and deposit beat, culminating in Charged Poise closure as Marek retreats, sealing bottle amid reconfigured border image. Orientation anchored early (mailman in arcade at twilight). Cost legible in "three months of rations" and 3-minute window risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade constrains choices (unwatched slots during shift), with sensory details (ozone scent, wobbling drones) integrated into action. Twilight hush and marble pillars charge final exhaling image, mirroring persistence. POV-filtered (scuff-mark borders, empty slots as constellations).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breach drone border via mail) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through storm release narrowing to 3-minute window, forcing precise deposits. Agency in timed subversion; cost in black-market forfeiture and detection risk alters tactics. Minor abstractness in "foster connection" but charged by specific envelope in slot 31.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of human persistence threading algorithmic gaps emerges organically from empty slots, storm mercy, and final arcade exhale. Resonant non-literal answer in "borders crossed by storms in hands and empty spaces in hearts," reweighting absences into net without moralizing. Particulars like slot 31 letter avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (absences as constellations, drone corridors mapped). Prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax ("vaulted ceiling absorbing... brittle hush"), modulating with pressure (short sentences in storm beat). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/action ("twisted the cap, releasing... ozone and rain"). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("thunderstorm in a bottle... roiling with contained voltage") slightly muddles peak release beat, but purposeful and non-obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman smuggling analog hope via EMP bottle in drone-partitioned world, transforming post-apoc tropes through "negative space" net and mercy scramble. Ingenuity peaks in slot-tracing to reunite family, inevitable from setup. Bold lyric risk in absence motif heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
