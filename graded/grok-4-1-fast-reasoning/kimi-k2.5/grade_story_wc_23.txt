<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied contradictions like prosthetic leg drumming in arrhythmia matching heart, revealing flawed endurance; final stasis earned by cognitive tide filling "cracks with silver light" to solder wire, foreclosing evacuation with felt cost of staying in ruin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from backstory shards to activation; on-page CR closure in "palm on the warm bronze, feeling the throb," reconfiguring reverse migration with undeniable cost of internal topography over external nav.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdigris corrosion matching censer foot constrains repurposing of hydraulics into memory engine, charging final image; selective sensory hierarchy (thrum through joints) mirrors cognitive fluctuation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to build fulcrum signaled early, tightens via moon-enabled soldering that narrows to inward signal; agency in activation forecloses outward navigation, but cost legibility slightly diffused by reflective layering before peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss cartography emerges implicitly from salvage assembly to final "geography left that recognized her name"; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing, counter-readings in indifferent stars adding ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "neurological tide tied to lunar pull" biases noticing; rhythmic modulation under stress consistent, single POV stable with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative consistency (e.g., "bone settling" click integrates salvage motif); zero loops, propulsion peaks in activation hum without overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-flood grief compass from censer pivot transforms migration trope; risk in lyric stasis heightens stakes via irreplaceable patchwork cognition charging inevitable ruin-home realization.</comment>
