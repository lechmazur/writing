<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority through sensory micro-choices like feeling tide on wrists and stitching as meditation, rooting motivation in layered vow; minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously keeps from 9+, but endurance earns closure boarding with felt cost of patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from rain ticking to fog lift, delivering Charged Poise closure as coachman boards after cable hum; orientation anchored early in tollhouse/river; cost legible in "crystalline permission" distilling years of waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Environment (river currents, pilings, fog drifts) and body (cheek coolness, wrist temperature) constrain waiting and charge final cable pulse; selective sensory hierarchy via ambient awareness filters POV perfectly, evolving causally to enable boarding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safe ferrying tightens via cadence shift in rain silence and fog thinning, forcing stance crystallization to board; agency in patient endurance forecloses unsafe crossing with conceptual cost of vow; one deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of distilling complexity/mercy emerges organically from stitching palimpsest vow to final "movement and rest"; resonant non-literal answer in boarding image reweights promise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of layered oaths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature of ambient awareness (e.g., "skin rather than his ears"); rhythmic modulation builds serene intensity to closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "reducing" motif, but minor overwrite in stacked figures like "tea through water, staining atmosphere" slightly muddles peak realization beat; propulsion clear, no loops, varied rhythm supports meditative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric waiting via ambient sensing transforms ferryman trope; bold risk in textural build to Charged Poise closure feels inevitable, with yarn needle/palimpsest adding specific ingenuity.</comment>
