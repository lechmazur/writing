<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene as empirical measurements clash with grief-stricken memories ("methodology faltered now, because she recognized the dead man"), earning the final renunciation of apprenticeship with visible emotional cost in her trembling hands steadied for the camera.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layered observations and memories build density to Charged Poise closure ("She sealed the lantern in an evidence bag, feeling its weight"), with legible cost in the "definitive end of her apprenticeship"; orientation anchored early in first paragraph, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel's mud, dripping concrete, and displaced gravel constrain choices (e.g., kneeling amid runoff) and charge final image (lantern's weight in bag); sensory selection reflects POV urgency, filtering through investigator's empirical bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of institutional negligence vs. personal liberation escalates accumulatively through deepening realizations (reports in satchel reweight mentor's death), driven by Maya's agency in documentation; cost unmistakable in foreclosed path of his "clinical shadow."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empirical detachment as liberation emerges organically from particulars like sediment layers and frayed rope, resonating in final non-literal image of carrying "history and present" forward without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in grief's entanglement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in empirical phrasing ("measuring the distance between rail ties") biases noticing toward oxidation and rigor mortis; stable close third-person modulates rhythm with emotional intensity, prose syntax reflecting fortified mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "water dripped from its base into the pool below, the sound reverberating... like a pulse from the past" advances sound, image, theme); minor paraphrase loops in "empirical observation" repetitions purposeful as motif, no scaffold or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad lantern in drought-revealed subway death transforms mentor-apprentice trope via institutional cover-up angle; risk in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight through particulars like maker's mark.</comment>
