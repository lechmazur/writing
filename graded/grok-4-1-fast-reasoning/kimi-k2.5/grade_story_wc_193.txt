<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in "virtuously mischievous instinct" enabling past siphon and climactic volunteer, with embodied cost in palm pressing; epiphany earned by prior scheme trauma without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>On-page CR closure as bolt-to-diamond transform merges timelines with legible conceptual cost ("etched with the faces of everyone she'd failed"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density to "concepts had finally, irrevocably, become physical."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Farm's bioluminescence constrains and charges closure by shifting to violet then prisms, mirroring internal alchemy; body as micro-setting in "skin learned the memory of deep-sea containment."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of debt-transformation escalates via text cascade and air hardening, agency in volunteer narrowing options under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in trauma crystallized as diamond weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-alchemy emerges organically from pyramid-multiverse motifs to resonant CR final image of planted diamond seeding light, reweighting promises without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic notices like "blue-green constellations that never quite matched the geometry of her ruined investment portfolios"; rhythmic control heightens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with zero loops, metaphors coherent (pressure/carbon); minor figurative density in climax ("lattice structure etched with faces") purposeful under taught pattern, no scaffold dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh quantum-pyramid synthesis transforms tropes via mushroom/bolt alchemy, inevitable in hindsight; bold poetic risks heighten stakes in "shadowseam wonder" without gimmickry.</comment>
