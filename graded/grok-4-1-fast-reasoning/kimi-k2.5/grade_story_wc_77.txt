<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's guilt-driven motivation intensifies credibly to confession, with embodied conflict in clasp heat and luminance pulse; advisor forces micro-choice pressure. Child-orchestrated murder reveal feels abruptly told rather than fully earned through prior micro-actions, slightly undercutting pivot flaw depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (luminance, mirrors, souls) building to RR closure in clasp absorption and glass crack—"the luminance flowed into the silver like water into sand"—with legible cost of self-exposure. Single scene, orientation anchored by entrance; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors and glass constrain revelation (faces pressed, final crack), charging closure image; sensory hierarchy (smells of cotton candy rot, cold clasp) filters through Mara's cursed perception. Micro-objects like camera hum evolve causally, mirroring internal rot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear via unbosoming) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through advisor's whispers and luminance flare, forcing agency in confession that forecloses denial with cost of "raw honesty of her self-betrayal." Pattern break reweights soul-consumption threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honesty poisoning shame emerges organically via paradox notes and confession—"the beauty of her sin had kept her frozen, but its ugliness set her free"—offering resonant CR without moralizing; final emptiness reweights curse premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dream-logic phrasing ("wet silk," "phosphorescent mold"); advisor dialogue subtextual and goal-pursuing. Rhythmic modulation heightens confession pressure, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; purposeful gothic metaphors cohere without muddle or loops. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught early supports accum lens without dulling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photographic soul-theft and ouroboros clasp transforms haunted funhouse trope; risky paradox-logic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "to kill the shadow, you must first become the knife."</comment>
