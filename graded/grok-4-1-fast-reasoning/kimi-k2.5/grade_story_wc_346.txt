<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to vouchsafe peace via lullaby compels all actions with embodied emotion in trembling hands and cheek on brass; earned endurance at closure shows change without unearned epiphany. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, tilting toward resolute summary over tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from gear adjustment to song rippling hush; closure as Charged Poise in gears stopping and stardust dissolution reconfigures existence with felt cost of final stillness on page. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse and role; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse at dusk, gears, and puppet constrain choices (alignment, placement) and charge final image of beam carrying whisper; sensory hierarchy narrows to grinding mechanism and pane ripples under crisis urgency. Recurring brass and crystalline interfaces evolve tactilely without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of merciful end signaled early tightens via mechanism groan and pane transformation under accumulative lens, foreclosing violent extinction with agency in song; cost legible in slowing gears and her fading voice. Single deepening suffices, no reversal needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of endings as love emerges organically from puppet memories and lullaby unifying souls, resonant in final golden thread image reweighting decay without moral statement. Particulars like flawed craftsmanship avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in bruised awe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in entropy poetry and biased noticing of whispers/gears; rhythmic modulation accelerates in song amid hush. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short crescendo sentences in climax; density high but patterned repetition of "nested patterns"/"pane of hush" borders paraphrase loops across three+ instances without full causal advance. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; closure image propels clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday clock as lullaby resonator transforms apocalypse trope via puppet quantum strings; risk in lyric end-of-time frame heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable premise inflection feels inevitable in stardust dissolution.</comment>
