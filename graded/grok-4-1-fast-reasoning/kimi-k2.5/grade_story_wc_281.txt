<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic shines in embodied conflict ("I don't believe in telepathy... but I believe in your pain"), with skepticism warring against protective love, earning final softening through prior discoveries; contradictory impulses act in scene, final renunciation of pills compelled by brother's recalled voice and neighbors' desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via somatic detections to pattern revelation in light paintings; on-page CR closure ("willowglass hope crystallizing") reconfigures skepticism with emotional cost of severing false intimacy, geode cooling as legible price in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Studio, geode, and body constrain choices (perimeter tracing, radiator pivot); final paintings charge closure image, mirroring neural pathways and desperation spirals through POV-biased sensory hierarchy (vibrations, warmth over visuals until dawn).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pill recall) tightens via accumulating markers (stomach clenching at radiator), forcing endurance with cost (charting "geography of desperation"); agency in fractal dance narrows options, convergence in spirals reweights under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of true connection emerges organically from geode-guided search to painting spirals, final image resonantly repricing pills' "false intimacy" without moralizing; subtext in silent language of hiding charges emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (fractal logic, somatic conduction); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, though minor elevated diction drifts in reflective peaks ("somatic markers grew stronger").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative density overwrites high-pressure search ("illuminating hidden pathways where the pills had been stashed") without full pattern payoff, minor paraphrase loops in "fractally precise" echoes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of geode dowsing, light painting documentation, and pill spirals transforms sci-fi trope into somatic art; risk in fractal method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via studio constraints.</comment>
