<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in traits drives micro-choices like rerouting via carnival pumps, with embodied stoic wonder; minor slip in lacking dramatized internal contradiction acting simultaneously, as competence dominates without visible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as decay patterns densify to resurrection; on-page CR closure via sunlight measurement confirming viability, with felt cost of night's redirection against design in "rerouting the emergency generators through the carnival's abandoned filtration units."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via carnival remnants enabling pumps and hydroponic rails; charges final image as "maze of intentions... now guided nutrients through spiral gardens," mirroring internal states through tactile salvage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hope equations tightens accumulatively through deepening success at dawn; agency in mapping and testing forecloses obsolescence path with visible night's cost, legible in hydroponic cycling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope as "pressure differential... correct channeling" emerges organically from redirection; resonant non-literal answer in margin equations and sextant paperweight, though "Hope, she concluded" borders echo without heavy penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in engineering geometry ("angles measured against stars"); rhythmic control modulates from hollow silence to stoic wonder without slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "fossilized hearts" and "mathematically precise" avoids muddle but slightly drifts register in peak revival beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi decay into greenhouse via precise salvage; risk in lyric repurposing feels inevitable, transforming tropes through "equations for hope" without hedging.</comment>
