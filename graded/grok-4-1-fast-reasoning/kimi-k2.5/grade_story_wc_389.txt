<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "believer who worshipped not the prophet himself, but the fracture," compelling the counter-words whisper that earns closure with loneliness as perfect cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of signals/storm builds to shadow projection as Conceptual Repricing, seeding cobalt rain with undeniable complication cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains projection choice and charges closure rain; storm sensory hierarchy (hail drumming, lightning charging glass) mirrors internal grit under POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadow dawn via prophet fracture) deepens accumulatively through coordinates to projection, narrowing to Elian's agency with loneliness cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of complicating certainty emerges via particulars; final cobalt rain reweights prophet's rise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mushroom-beard trembling," "grit in a gear") and rhythmic modulation under storm pressure sustain single POV texture perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative density ("origami swans made of smoke") in climax borders overload without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-prophet-shadows transforms tropes; portico projection fork risks bold ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight for gritty-whimsy dawn.</comment>
