<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied tremors and deliberate imprecision under pressure, with contradictory confidence driving micro-choices like imprecise strokes. Final humility earned via editing her failure. Minor label-speak repetition ("confidently uncertain") borders diagnostic without full deduction as it acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural Hybrid lens holds: density builds to pen crumbling as CR, reweighting past error with cost (pen's inkless sacrifice, contingency dissolution). Orientation anchored early (observatory in anomaly). Closure legible in ships' emergence and her recording on ordinary paper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Anomaly and pen constrain choices (nib drinks light on glass, pulses digest changes), charging final image of empty space. Sensory hierarchy (starlight as mercury) reflects her priorities. No white-room; lived-in via groaning metal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save ships) signaled early, escalates via ghosts and anomaly reaction under lens, narrowing to release via imprecision. Agency in strokes forecloses recursive trap with cost (pen dust). Minor abstractness in contingent mechanics softens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of error-harvested wisdom emerges via particulars (wrong seeds to bridge), resonant in final humility without moralizing. CR reweights certainty as barrier. No tidy binary; ambiguity lingers in "confidently uncertain" poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (celestial metaphors like origami time). Voice modulates rhythmically, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping; ghosts peripheral.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motifs (unbending images), but exact phrase loops ("dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib" thrice, "confidently uncertain"/"strange comfort"/"wrong seeds" churn) dull propulsion mid-beat, −1.2 total. Rhythms vary; no filter stacks. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of iridium pen editing spacetime origami transforms time-travel trope via anomaly logic and humbled interpreter. Risky lyric sci-fi pays off in charged CR. No derivatives; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
