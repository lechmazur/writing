<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength: embodied olfaction and contradictory endurance (planting despite future stench) compel choices with visible cost; weakness: occasional diagnostic phrasing like "emotional architecture of her ambition" borders on unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure (planting and germination detection reconfigures ambition); cost legible in anticipated olfactory suffering; orientation anchored early in bridge scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Treetop sway and hollow crook constrain planting choice and charge final germination image; olfactory hierarchy reflects POV urgency; sensory evolution from mist to golden song mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant seed amid motion/contradictions) tightens via doodle-map recognition narrowing hollow choice; endurance agency forecloses easy escape with felt future cost; lens-consistent density escalates to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of contradictory wisdom emerges organically from doodles-to-planting arc; final germination smile offers non-literal resonant answer to serenity-in-motion question, reweighting ambition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with olfactory perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation (lyric swells to crisp final image) sustains texture under meditative pressure; no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sense/action; purposeful repetition ("wildflower hush") builds tone without loops; minor register elevation fits voice but risks drift in reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory herbalism, ancestral doodle-maps, and treetop physics transforms corpse-flower trope; risk-taking in scent-driven lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
