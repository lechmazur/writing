<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to interrupt destiny roots in consistent hopelessness balanced by persistent micro-choices like adjusting temperature after failures; embodied emotions in "trembling hands of prelates" touch and smoke-reading show contradiction. Final evolution earned by prior approximations with cost of decades' regret. Minor slip: abstract "stoically sensitive" labels slightly dilute peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of failed approximations builds to cadence shift at "the wood did not burn but rather surrendered," delivering Charged Poise RR with legible cost in crystallized possibility versus calcified regret. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Single continuous scene fits defaults perfectly; closure reconfigures options undeniably on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains via crucible heat syncing heartbeat and temperature thresholds shaping approximations; twilight's "frozen bloom of violet and copper" charges final lattice image. Sensory hierarchy alchemical: smoke as "cryptic alphabet," obsidian floor tactile. No generic placeholders; details evolve causally with process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interrupt destiny via crozier transformation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through two failed approximations narrowing options before final deepening; agency in "increased the heat one final, calculated degree." Cost legible in retained fire versus ash, charging poise. Entry to 8+ via trade-off foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Creative destruction theme emerges organically from particulars like "burning away the dogma," reweighted in final lattice as "neural pathways or river deltas." Resonant non-literal closure in "frozen bloom stood—a testament" answers destiny interruption without moralizing. Complexity lingers in evolved ambiguity of power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with alchemist perceptual signature: notices "temperature at which faith became vapor." Rhythmic prose modulates from methodical to exalted at "profound silence"; diction purposeful, no head-hopping. Voice texture distinct in fractal metaphors like "spectral rainbows."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action, perception, adjustment without loops; rhythm varies for tension, e.g., short "He increased the heat one final, calculated degree." Minor figurative density in early approximations borders overwriting but coheres thematically; no scaffold or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical creative destruction interrupting personal/crozier destiny via carbon glass lattice; transforms trope through "successive approximation" ingenuity. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from "penny dropped" realization grown from particulars.</comment>
