<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through tactile filtering ("pressed these auditory fragments against their palms"); final endurance as layered identity earned by sensory accretion, with embodied cost of void-filling hunger; contradictory impulses in erasure-as-liberation subtle but scene-active.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via layering motifs to CR closure ("to discover the texture of memories was to become the texture itself"), reweighting erasure premise; conceptual cost legible in "histories are written in water, not stone"; orientation anchored early ("green container, seventh stack").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Labyrinth setting constrains navigation ("corridors where voices echoed and frayed") and charges final image ("pressed their ear against the corrugated steel"); sensory hierarchy POV-biased (texture over sight); salt wind, tides evolve with internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct memory texture) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density ("layer upon layer") to stance crystallization; agency in collecting/filtering forces trade-off of nameless endurance; cost felt in "porous boundary between living and being archived."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-accretion emerges organically from particulars (rust, silt, tides); final image resonant non-literal answer ("become the texture itself") reweights erasure without moralizing; subtext in poison label's evolution avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("sounds had grain, silence had weight"); rhythmic modulation heightens density (long layering sentences to crisp end); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "poison warnings bleeding into the fabric like a tattoo" advances prop/character/theme); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherence in texture pattern, no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synesthetic archivist premise transformed via port textures (bureaucratic erasure as container mismatch); bold lyric risk in metaphor-density heightens stakes, inevitable at closure; no derivative echoes.</comment>
