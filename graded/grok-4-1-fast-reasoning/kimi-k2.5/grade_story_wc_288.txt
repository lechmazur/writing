<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied motivation culminate in earned change at "the last fragile piece of her old self snap cleanly away," with contradictory fear of loneliness acting against drive for independence. Final choice reveals values hierarchy with visible cost of renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (sundial, hum, clouds) tightening to CR closure in "She was the first librarian of a new solitude," with conceptual cost of accepting dispersed consciousness legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stone circle's hum and tidal library's drift constrain ritual choice and charge climax; selective details like "shelves of living coral breathing" mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming isolation escalates via ritual deepening (sundial placement to hovering), driven by agency; cost unmistakable in "snap cleanly away like frost from a branch," foreclosing old self under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of translating isolation emerges organically through shifting sundial image (self to sky), offering resonant non-literal answer in final reflection without moralizing; reweights prologue realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in atmospheric noticing (e.g., "hum... vibrated in her teeth"); rhythmic control heightens pressure, elisions purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; purposeful repetition of motifs like "brittle awakening" integrates without muddle, clear in peak hum crescendo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud-tides consciousness and reincarnation memory transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via sundial payoff.</comment>
