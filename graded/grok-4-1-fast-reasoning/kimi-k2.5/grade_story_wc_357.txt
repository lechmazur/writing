<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in pilot's expertise intensifies credibly under time pressure; interiority embodied in "stomach lurched" and sensor calibration. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal discovery beat, limiting to strong but not exceptional. Micro-choices like touching stone reveal values with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations densify toward CR closure: realization of "resilience as memorial" reconfigures premise with chronometer's urgent cost legible on-page. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene causality tight without breaks. Final descent image pays off constraint pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward rivers constrain navigation/clamps, charging final dive; bioluminescent groves and "mossy underside" filter through pilot's priorities. Sensory hierarchy vivid under inversion urgency. Recurring water flow evolves causally, mirroring internal discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find resilience source) signaled early, tightens via chronometer beep narrowing options before gravity shift; agency in rig calibration forecloses extraction path with time cost. Escalation accumulative under lens, pressure coherent to CR. No reversals needed; endurance suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited endurance emerges organically from echoes and arrow tip, reweighted in final orchards "singing with echoes" without moralizing. Resonant CR answers premise via image, not statement; complexity in temporal cost lingers. Particulars like spectral farmers drive insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with pilot's perceptual signature (e.g., "magnetic clamps engaging with shuddering clang"); diction/rhythm modulate from charged tension to poised resolution. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in revelations legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "accelerated growth surged through her rig's hull, repairing micro-fractures"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("frozen lightning") purposeful without muddle in peak beats. Minor density in revelation beat avoids artifact cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of inversion physics, temporal anchors, and memorial resilience transforms sci-fi tropes; arrow tip's frequency as "beacon of inherited endurance" feels inevitable. Risky geological conceit heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
