<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "furiously tranquil" steady hands amid chest storm, compelling song choice; earned dual-role realization at kneeling with felt burning patience cost. Minor abstract diagnostic phrasing like "quantum probabilities" slightly detaches peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from hatch to thaw spiral staircase; CR closure in tasting borrowed time reconfigures inheritance with undeniable burning patience cost, legible in final kneel and shoot image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atrium constrains via frozen rim depression and evolving ice-to-dew; starlight filters to illuminate shoot, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (breath fractals, crunching boots) mirrors reversal urgency through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to reverse decay tightens texturally via songs pulling order from chaos, narrowing to descent trade-off; agency in cap placement and singing forces endurance with patience-burn cost legible on page. Single decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance as entropy defiance emerges organically from seed stir and upward fountain; final granular taste image offers resonant non-literal repricing of borrower-lender duality without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases to chlorophyll memory and spirals, with rhythmic modulation under reversal pressure; stable close-third POV filters entropy mechanics through Elara's noticing, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density weaves image-action like "frost retreated from terracotta pots"; purposeful lyric metaphors (time as taffy, bark under nails) taught early without muddle, though thaw peak borders overwrite density. Zero loops, varied rhythm propels to charged end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bold entropy-reversal synthesis via songs and vortex transforms eco-inheritance trope; risky lyric risk heightens texture stakes, inevitable in hindsight from acorn key to green shoot under glass.</comment>
