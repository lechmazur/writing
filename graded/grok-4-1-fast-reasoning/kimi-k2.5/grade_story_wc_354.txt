<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between past precision and newfound feeling act in scene via magnetic-path moves; final placement earned by exile's causal arc. Worry stone's dent aligning with fingerprint reveals character under pressure without epiphany shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence/images builds to CR closure in stone split and reconfiguration, with conceptual cost of reframed exile legible ("silence felt like invitation"). Orientation anchored early; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus constrains knight's curved trajectory and bishop's impossible gap, charging final stabilization image; twilight violet bends light tactilely through POV's strategist lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore covenant) deepens texturally via silence translation narrowing options; agency in non-standard moves forecloses standard play with past-failure cost felt in warm stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of split stone as "book finally opened" resonantly reweights light/shadow tension without moral; emerges organically from puzzle struggle, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chess-magnetic diction ("vectors of force but the poetry of constraint"); rhythmic control heightens meditative pressure, stable close-3rd POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images without loops or muddle; rhythm varies purposefully, e.g., short sentences in moves ("He moved his knight") accelerate to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess, magnetism, lunar covenant transforms exile trope; risk of physics-bent moves heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via nexus rules.</comment>
