<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via peripheral observation and trembling hands at winding, rooting motivation in consistent traits; micro-choices like filing the escapement tooth align with locksmith precision and compel stakes. Minor flaw in repeated motivation phrasing slightly abstracts embodiment, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light mappings and realizations builds to DC closure as timer ticks with legible cost in nine-day effort and scarred geometry. Orientation anchors early (Elias in Echo Garden); one tightening via timer's "harvest" purpose narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: light skittering at 32 degrees constrains repair choices, quartz vein and fractured acoustics charge final exhale image. POV bias shapes hierarchy (professional angles over direct stare); no white-room, evolves with quake scars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore echoes via timer) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through crack revelations and gear resync, forcing trade-offs in reverse-engineering. Agency in filing/winding forecloses failure path; cost felt in "trembling hands" and season's lull, unmistakable at tick.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-in-reason emerges organically from particulars like peripheral cracks and echo harvest, reweighting premise in final resonant tick/smile without moralizing. Returning light/echo images shift meaning, inviting ambiguity on magic's logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (peripheral glimpses, shadow lengths); rhythmic texture modulates from mapping calm to winding tension. Prose as character: syntax mirrors locksmith precision, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in light-gear interplay, but −0.6 for paraphrase loops on "wounded season," "peripherally," and "store wonder" across beats, dulling some momentum without obscuring closure tick. Varied rhythm passes ear test; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: timer as echo-harvester fixed via light angles transforms locksmith trope into resonant physics-magic frame. Risky accumulative repair over days heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight at exhale/click.</comment>
