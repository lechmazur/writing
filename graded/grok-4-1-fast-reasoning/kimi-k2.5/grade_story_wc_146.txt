<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength in embodied endurance via 17 years' walking concentrated at keystone, aligning actions with motive; weakness in minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with patience mostly told rather than clashing in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from footsteps to polyrhythm/dance tightening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "seventeen years of walking concentrated in that single point," reconfiguring exile to potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain choices (rhythm generation, keystone placement) and charge final image (archway sings, new structure rises); sensory hierarchy (vibrations, notes, glow) filtered through tuner's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival vs. collapse) escalates accumulatively via dissonance detection to quickened dance narrowing options; agency in rhythm intensification forecloses dominion path with patience's felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges organically from rhythm teaching stones to listen, culminating in non-literal final image of "newborn" archway reweighting conquest to balance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic syntax/prose texture mirrors footsteps (e.g., "polyrhythm that spoke of rivers and root systems"); stable close-POV with perceptual bias toward resonances; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., footsteps advance plot, embody emotion, build rhythm); minor deduction for "infinitely patient" repetition and "wild hush" echoes as untaught tics dulling propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic ecology and restoration (footsteps as mortar, fork as nexus) feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
