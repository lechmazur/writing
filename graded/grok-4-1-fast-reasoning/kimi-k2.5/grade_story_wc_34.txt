<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to articulate needs intensifies through micro-choices like pressing the plate harder, earning her fulfilled isolation at the map reveal; embodied rusty voice reveals disuse concretely. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in the pivotal duet moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as etchings glow → mist shapes → duet → dust swirls to Charged Poise closure in graffiti map, reconfiguring ghost's trap with conceptual cost of mechanical sorrow voiced via plate. Orientation anchored early in misty courtyard; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty courtyard with steam vents, obelisk receptacle, and static air constrain encoding choice and charge final shiver/map image; sensory hierarchy (mechanical heartbeat, fossilized gardens) reflects Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating needs signaled early tightens accumulatively via ghost's mist response forcing duet adaptation, narrowing digital/organic gap with agency-cost in time compression; legible price in ghost's apology felt via plate rotation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bridging unspoken needs emerges organically from graffiti notes (water/sunlight/touch) to duet resonance, final map reweighting isolation without moral; earned via particulars, invites lingering ambiguity on mechanical violence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward mechanical-organic fusion (clockwork chimes, fossilized petals); rhythmic poetic diction modulates with pressure in rusty song, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in encoding sequence, varied rhythm passes ear test; purposeful motif repetition ("between lightning and thunder") taught early pays off at thunder crack without obscuring closure, minor overwrite in stacked metaphors around plate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh steampunk synthesis of code-ghost graffiti encoding transforms tropes via fossilized gardens and pneumatic emotion; map reveal turn inevitable from prior particulars, bold risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
