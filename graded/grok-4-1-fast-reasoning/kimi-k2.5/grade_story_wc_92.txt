<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in preparation drives actions, revealed through precise micro-choices like aligning the quill holder; embodied calm under pressure feels character-specific. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with competence dominating over struggle or flaws complicating the peak execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure at sundial completion ("seeds of rebellion... geometrically inevitable"), reconfiguring power with felt risk cost in silence and timing. Orientation anchored early; single scene causality intact via preparatory beats to final painting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial's half-painted grooves and gnomon shadow constrain positioning and reveal angles, charging final image; selective sensory details (cold wall, phosphorescent ink) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal poise. Twilight blackout evolves causally, guiding choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revolution ignition) signaled early tightens via blackout-enabled deepening, narrowing to sundial quadrant with on-page risk cost in undetected precision. Agency in painting forecloses exposure path; pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silent reconfiguration emerges organically from geometric intrigue and shadow-pointing armory, resonant in final "quiet click of understanding" without moralizing. Particulars like coded angles reweight power subtly, inviting ambiguity on revolution's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (inventive grace in noticing mortar dust, impossible angles); rhythmic prose modulates tension purposefully. No dialogue; diction biased to conspiracy (winking hush), consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense, propulsive sentences vary rhythm but figurative density in peak beats ("heartbeat of the coming change") risks overwriting (−0.4); minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "calmly inventive" reprises). High info density integrates action/image cleanly overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial-coded revolution via quill ink transforms intrigue trope ingeniously, growing inevitable from particulars; bold geometric premise commits fully, heightening stakes through subtle misdirection.</comment>
