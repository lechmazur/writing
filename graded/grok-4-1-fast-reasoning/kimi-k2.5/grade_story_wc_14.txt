<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—incandescent restraint versus accelerating against the lamp's stutter—act in scene, earning the final sealing with visible cost of fabricated continuity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via hum-charted vibrations to stutter-induced final adhesion, delivering Charged Poise closure where refraction layers all times against leaking void, cost legible in "sealing a letter to the future."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth constrains circulation back to bench and leans into climax, charging final dawn-prism image on gilded pages.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of textural preservation escalates accumulatively via lamp stutter narrowing options, protagonist agency in restrained pressing reweights void with on-page cost of invention's fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final refraction image offers resonant answer to preservation-through-fiction, reweighting invented histories as sedimented anchors without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of bending light/gold/time holds under pressure; rhythmic control modulates from vigilant charting to closing incantation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax; refraction motif coheres without muddle, though figurative layering risks minor overload in stutter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Gilding invented histories via lamp hum transforms memory trope into bold, inevitable synthesis charging closure.</comment>
