<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's scavenger trait drives concrete micro-choices like winding the wheel and pouring regrets, earning the trade-off climax; minor abstraction in "motivation eroded into something sharper" summarizes rather than embodies pivotal regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as whisper density builds to rejection and confession, delivering on-page RR closure in the transfer ("Mara grew light and translucent") with legible cost; orientation anchors early in lagoon and halted carousel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Violet mist clings whispers and guides collection, carousel pole mirrors youth to constrain negotiation site, charging final resumption image; sensory hierarchy (creak, hum, swirl) filters through scavenger bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to bargain for continuity tightens via ghost's rejection of stories, forcing personal confession with agency-driven cost (translucence); escalation coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Regret trade reconfigures eroded ambitions into "fertile ground," resonating non-literally via crystal narratives and seed chest image without moralizing; subtext emerges organically from failed bargain to acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV lyrical voice with perceptual signature (time pooling, whispers as seeds) modulates rhythm under pressure; sparse dialogue carries dissonance subtext cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels from mist advance to final spin with varied syntax; surreal metaphors cohere without muddle, though opening figurative density borders overwrite but teaches pattern early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal wheel-as-story-currency and self-ghost trade transform regret trope boldly, synthesizing time fracture with negotiation into inevitable reconfiguration; risk heightens stakes legibly.</comment>
