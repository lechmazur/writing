<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of jealousy vs. control act vividly in the scene, embodied in "jealousy heated his blood until the cabin seemed too small"; final crystallization of motivation earned through ascent with visible endurance cost of accepting fragmentation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as emotional density builds to Conceptual Repricing in "motivation crystallized... merely to chronicle it with... detachment," reweighting timeline chaos with conceptual cost of detachment; orientation anchored early in cabin post-grave.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moss on walls, wind carrying "pine and decomposition," cabin pressing inward constrain choices and mirror internal pressure; mountain air "bit his lungs with... truth" charges ascent and final return image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to distill chaos signaled early; jealousy-fueled ascent deepens under accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance via agency in "let the jealousy expand"; cost legible in foreclosed linear certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of narration taming chaos emerges organically; final scroll "curled against his chest" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting jealousy and time without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in time-looped observations like "moss... older than the stubble... or... sprouted simultaneously"; rhythmic control modulates from feral clawing to gentle snowflake descent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("ouroboros," "tapestry") taught early; varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor jealousy repetition risks minor churn offset by motif payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time paradox via jealousy-as-wings transforms trope; ascent revealing "shimmering constellation" feels inevitable from prior particulars, bold risk heightens stakes.</comment>
