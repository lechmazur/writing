<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Elara's grace as "weapon against brutality" clashing with surrender to the whale's call; final detachment earned via scrimshaw's hum building to fusion with her sternum. Mako's secondary pressure via recognition reinforces without stealing focus. Minor abstraction in "barometric pressure of her soul" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (ripples as syllables, horizon shimmer) builds to Charged Poise closure where island solidifies and Elara surfaces transformed, cost legible in "farewell... to the fortress... now finally breached." Single scene anchored immediately in docks and mist; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe vividly constrains via retreating tide exposing pylons and tidal pools mirroring internal dissolution; recurring water/foam charges final image of sovereignty "between tides." POV-filtered details (liquid silver, barnacle-crusted) integrate seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (detach false self) signaled early via scrimshaw ache, escalates accumulatively through intensifying whale calls and "lines slipping," narrowing to cable release with vulnerability cost. Agency in stepping off forecloses harbor life, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as freedom emerges organically via guarded heart motif shifting to "bone calling to bone"; final hand-raised farewell reconfigures without moralizing, resonant answer to safety-vs-truth question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (water's language, marrow vibration) stable in third-limited POV; Mako's dialogue distinct in "combative tenderness," subtext-laden. Rhythm modulates from mist-trailing grace to fluid surfacing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-packed sentences; purposeful metaphors (spiral map, liquid silver) cohere without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening mist description doesn't dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of selkie myth with post-Treaty world and scrimshaw-as-key transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via whale's "persistent, loving summons."</comment>
