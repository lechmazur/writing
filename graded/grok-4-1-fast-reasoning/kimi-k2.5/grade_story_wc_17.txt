<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara's sensitively perceptive trait drives consistent micro-choices like ear-to-stone and vibration detection, rooting motivation in occupational specificity. Interiority shows embodied emotion (chest pressure from legacy). Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; realization feels poised but summary-like without peak struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer density toward CR closure in final image ("burden settled upon her shoulders"), reweighting her mapping premise with emotional cost legible on page. Orientation anchored early (para 1). Single-shard exploration fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (damp stone pulse, roots cracking marble, moldy darkness) filter through her perceptual bias, constraining navigation (careful steps, flashlight use). Recurring ivy-veiled passage bookends and charges final exit. Environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover walls' dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing to personal burden. Agency in pursuit forecloses ignorance with felt cost at end. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges organically from particulars (diaries, negative, Elias's guilt), culminating in resonant CR: her maps chart memory, reweighting prior echoes without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibrations, wall breaths); lyrical rhythm modulates beautifully with intensity. Voice texture (poetic syntax) reflects her mind, consistent under stress. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("film negative strip," "half-burned diaries found in a fireplace," "ivy-veiled passage" repeated verbatim) and synonym churn (burden/legacy) dull density in reflective beats. Rhythm varies but template cadence in discoveries. No closure harm; high info density otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise (echo cartographer mapping wall dreams) transforms post-climate tropes via specific perceptual tools and memory topography. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR; singular vision coheres without hedging.</comment>
