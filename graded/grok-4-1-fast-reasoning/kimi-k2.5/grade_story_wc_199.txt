<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied "old urgency" in his chest evolving to "mossy delight"; micro-choices like collecting dust and rearranging monuments reveal a hierarchy of values shifting from cataloging loss to renewal, earning his transformation with visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from sorting to prodding bark—"the tree shuddered"—culminating in CR closure where Elias becomes the seed, reweighting loss as chrysalis with legible cost in "ribs becoming galleries for wind"; orientation anchored early, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "leaves tumbling... sideways, caught in the arbor's peculiar gravity" constrain choices (prodding heartwood on main branch) and charge final image of blooming arbor; body/setting integration via tactile bark crevice and drifting leaves mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode leaves signaled early tightens via dust discovery and prodding reversal, forcing transformation trade-off; agency in rearranging monuments forecloses sorter path with felt cost in bodily change under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memorials as receivers for renewal emerges organically from rearranging "tiny monuments... into a new configuration, a mandala," offering resonant non-literal answer in final ascending leaf without moralizing; complexity lingers in wild/orderly synthesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature—"veined architecture" of leaves—modulates rhythmically under rising pressure; purposeful lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density peaks in transformation beat ("ribs becoming galleries... skin... bark that breathes") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops, strong propulsion to "scattered the last... seeds into the rising wind."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore and ecology in skyborne arbor transforms trope of lonely curator into self-seeding renewal; risk-taking in bodily metamorphosis heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from monuments' reconfiguration.</comment>
