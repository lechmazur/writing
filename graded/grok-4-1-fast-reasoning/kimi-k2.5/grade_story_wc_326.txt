<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between defiant counting and trusting integration act in scene, culminating in stopping at "one hundred and twelve" as earned renunciation with visible cost of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from static clearing to ink shifts and ghost integration; CR closure lands on-page as Elara integrates ghost into chest, reweighting existence with conceptual cost of transcending binaries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal dome and snowdrifts constrain light/manipulation choices; porcelain shard and ink lattice charge final image where shard completes circuit, mirroring internal reclamation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming identity tightens accumulatively via heartbeat-accelerated ink reorganization, forcing integration trade-off; cost legible in foreclosed survival ritual at "trusting for the first time the rhythm."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of existing "in the spaces between certainties" emerges organically from ink neural maps and ghost dissolution; final image offers resonant CR repricing of "administrative death" without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in heartbeat translations and ink interpretations; rhythmic prose modulates with pressure to charged poise, stable single POV throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but figurative density (e.g., "frozen tear," "dendritic patterns") borders overwriting in buildup without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clerical erasure and ink-defragmentation transforms digital ghost trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative form heightens stakes of anomaly realization.</comment>
