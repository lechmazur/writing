<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied contradiction in "foxglove regret, that exquisite sorrow... slightly poisonous to her sanity," driving her endurance despite known costs; final hand on child's name orchid earns stasis through prior micro-choices like pruning and tapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine to anomalous tube discovery, climaxing in atrium tap with RR/Charged Poise closure as tube crumbles to dust, fortifying orchids temporarily with legible conceptual cost in fading light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (air "tasted of violet nostalgia," orchids' "faint hum") constrains climax ascent and charges final image; cloud-mist floor and prismatic shelves evolve with light bloom, mirroring internal preservation drive without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names vs. entropy) signaled early, tightens via tube's perfect resonance forcing atrium choice; agency in precise tap yields visible cost (tube's sacrifice, sanity poison) charging poise under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation's poisonous beauty emerges organically from particulars like "names sang themselves awake," resonant in final orchid touch reweighting extinction's inevitability without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("petal holding a syllable"); rhythmic prose modulates from calm ("steps that barely stirred") to peak intensity ("light bloomed from the sound"), stable close third-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("tapped it against the opal railing, and the crack... refracting"); no loops or muddle, metaphors cohere (sound-to-light via imperfection) in climax without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic memory-crystals and imperfection-as-salvation transforms trope of lonely archivist; bold lyric world commits fully, with tube's crumble inevitably charging bittersweet poise.</comment>
