<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of joyful sorrow in Elias's chest ache and tears at climax; contradictory impulses in mapping vs. signing resolve into earned CR. Mara as crucible forces micro-choices via signs, deepening motivation. Minor poetic abstraction in interiority doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from camera frames to signed symphony CR with conceptual cost of accepted obscurity. Anchored early (pier, Elias, night); no orientation debt. Final "I can hear it now" reconfigures silence with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescence sparks and pier-end horizon constrain mapping choices and charge final frame. Sensory hierarchy (visual absences, tactile warmth) reflects deaf POV bias perfectly. Environment evolves to mirror internal crescendo without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to disrupt forgetting) tightens via cadence shift to signing; agency in gestures forecloses noisy disruption path. Cost felt in "sweet ache" and tears at "Then play." Minor abstractness in early stake signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-song emerges organically via camera staves and signed notes; final image reweights forgetting without moral. Resonant CR answers premise non-literally through particulars like empty shutter clicks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mapping silence into geometry" biases noticing absences; rhythmic control modulates to peak in signing dance. Stable single-POV, no leakage; whispers/signs carry subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: each line layers texture toward closure image. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful "silence" recurrence taught early. Zero figurative muddle in climax gestures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf ex-musician mapping silence via empty camera to sign-symphony transforms obscurity trope. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from opening coat/pier solitude.</comment>
