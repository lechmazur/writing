<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in breath fogging dome and pressing petals embodies grief; realization earned via brother's telegram causality, foreclosing solitary burden with universal distribution cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "healing with words" borders therapy-speak but ties to micro-choices like speaking/recording.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stellar pulses build density to CR closure ("temple was not a place but a process") with conceptual cost in reframing brother's death. Orientation anchored in first line (observatory, Cepheids); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chilled dome, brass eyepiece, iron stairs constrain observation and charge final descent/archive image; sensory hierarchy (fogged breath, scratching pen) reflects urgency. Details evolve causally from midnight to dawn, mirroring realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode brother's stellar temple) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via pulses-to-lullabies; agency in writing forecloses isolation with felt cost of shared grief. One tightening sufficient, charges poise in archiving telegram.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from stars encoding dreams/inscriptions; resonant CR in final image reweights grief as light points. Final sentence ("we survive... sharing them") echoes thesis too overtly, docking explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with stellar syntax/rhythm specific to Elara's perceptual bias (light pulses as syllables); stable close-third POV, no elision; modulates from tracking to solace descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short pulses vs. flowing realizations); minor paraphrase loop in "she wrote of merchant... widow... brother" but purposeful list advances healing. No major artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: variable stars as grief Morse code chronicled in dreams transforms tropes; inevitable hindsight from brother's telegram to universal ledger, risks lyric astronomy payoff.</comment>
