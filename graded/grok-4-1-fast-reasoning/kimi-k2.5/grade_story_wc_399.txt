<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in vulnerability (removes mask, forehead to sand) and micro-choices under pressure reveal humility and patience; motivation consistent but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ test. Competence balanced by desert's hunger, yet no blind spots compound visibly. Final endurance earned by prior spirals and listening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vibrations/sand patterns to ritual sync, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as parapet accepts echo with conceptual cost of human smallness legible in "some echoes are not meant to be kept by human hands." Orientation anchored first paragraph. Single scene tightens meaningfully without micro turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurrent kinetic parapet and sand constrain ritual choices (rises protectively, accepts burden) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (visible/hidden eye, murmurs, gears grinding) reflects POV bias perfectly. Micro-setting (mask, footsteps glow) guides spirals/peripheral tactics. Evolves causally with consecration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echo) signaled early, escalates texturally as clearing contracts/desert presses, forcing endurance with agency in binding song; cost felt in shrinking circle and vulnerability. One decisive deepening suffices; no coincidence resolves. Charges final reconfiguration under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom's preservation via humility/machinery emerges organically from ritual vessel-role and final image repricing human limits ("patient machinery of the earth"); resonant non-literal answer to echo's fate without moralizing. Complexity in desert's indifference lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (peripheral awareness bias) with rhythmic modulation matching whisperfield calm to peak sync; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure. No head-hopping; diction reflects mind's patient poise under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but patterned repetition ("kinetic parapet beneath the dunes" x4 exact, "peripheral awareness" x3) borders template cadence without full offset (−0.6); minor scaffold in redundant honesty mentions dulls slightly. Closure image clear despite; no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of line walker/peripheral sight with mechanical earth-memory transforms desert trope into inevitable ritual poise; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels earned from particulars, not template.</comment>
