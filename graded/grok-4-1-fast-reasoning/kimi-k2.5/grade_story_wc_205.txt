<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's arc from defunct revolutionary to tender custodian earned through shard discovery and mirror refusal, with embodied contradiction in fighting past versus elegizing; motivation intensifies via causal anchors like the shard's poetry. Minor label-speak ("poetically inclined") told rather than fully shown in tradeoffs. Final weeping moment seals change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (shard, storms, mirrors) build density to CR closure in Kaelen's weeping and decision to remain, reweighting premise with emotional cost ("for the first time since the revolution's failure, he wept"). Orientation anchored early (asteroid chapel, post-revolution). One tightening via shard suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and visible time constrain choices (mirror covering, shard handling) and charge final image (shard on sill amid streaming time). Sensory specifics like "amber wine" and "molten honey" filter through poetic POV, evolving with events. Micro-setting (shard, mirrors) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine civilization vs. Voss's domination) signaled early, escalates texturally via shard experiments and presentation narrowing options to recognition. Agency in refusing mirrors then covering honors cost. Climax presentation forces stance crystallization with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reverence over conquest emerges organically from particulars (vases as apologies, ornamentation as valves), resonant CR in final shard-whispering image reweighting without moralizing. Shard motif shifts meaning across beats, inextricable from arc. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in forgiveness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature ("time pooled like amber wine"); diction/rhythm modulate intensity (short storm sentences). Brief Voss dialogue implied natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; voice biases toward grace in ruins.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density but figurative overload ("burnished sorrow," "metal against velvet") in most sentences risks coherence without pattern payoff, docking prose propulsion in reflective peaks. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies. Clarity holds at closure shard image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time as reverent garden transforms sci-fi tropes via poetic archaeology; baroque asteroid's ornaments as "pressure valve" turn inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
