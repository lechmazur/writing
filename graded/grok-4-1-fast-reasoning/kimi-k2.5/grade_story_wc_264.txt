<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation sharply rooted in duty replacing dreams, embodied via clock as "stopped heart"; final endurance as distributed sentinel earned by accumulative realization. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to CR closure: clock placement reconfigures Kael as eternal spark with conceptual cost of dreamless vigilance in "fractured lullaby." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via self-realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dune constrains quantum steps and charges final clock rings freezing lichen; archive's "crystallized time" mirrors internal persistence. Recurrent wave functions filter through POV urgency, selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate sparks via archive) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when Kael realizes "become the spark himself"; agency in whispering/placing clock forecloses solitary duty with felt eternal distribution cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistence amid ash emerges organically from seed/pollen images reweighted in archive opening; final image offers resonant CR answer to loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (e.g., "phosphorescent lichen... breathing giant"); rhythmic modulation builds pressure poetically. Stable close third-person with clean free indirect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative layering in most sentences (e.g., opening dune/forest metaphors) borders overwriting without crisp payoff in peak whisper beat. Minor wave-function repetitions paraphrase without escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quantum archive keyed by frozen clock transforms post-fire tropes into pollen-distributed prayer; risk of lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
