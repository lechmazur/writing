<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Embodied shift from pulsar racing to sediment patience reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene; final rewiring renunciation earned by prior observations with visible cost of forsaking old papers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust density patterns deepen knowledge; CR closure lands in neural rewiring image with conceptual cost of humility reweighting cosmic premise, constraint of greenhouse decay persistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust and greenhouse fractures constrain observation choices and charge final layers image; sensory hierarchy (microscopic scales to constellations) reflects astrophysicist's bias, evolving with causal decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stripping drama tightens accumulatively through dust gradients narrowing to flood path revelation; agency in sustained attention forecloses violent-scale pursuits with felt cost in rewired patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of miniature grandeur emerges implicitly via butterfly dust tracing decay; final image reweights violent cosmic change with non-literal conceptual cost of humility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters wreckage as data matrices; rhythmic modulation matches slowing timescale, POV stable with scientific diction consistent under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in dust-pattern beats propels via varied syntax; minor paraphrase loop on "accumulated dust patterns" dulls one mid-section without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron-star math and butterfly-dust entropy transforms tropes of epiphany; risk in lyric timescale shift heightens stakes inevitably from greenhouse particulars.</comment>
