<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses as discoverer/beast act in weaving threads and accepting threshold identity; final hand grasp earned by prior micro-choices with identity cost legible. Interiority concrete via mismatched eyes and pulsing card.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via memory shifts and fog thickening to CR closure at "ship began to dissolve around her," reweighting narrative reality with conceptual cost of plural mythology.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rotting carousel horses and candy-floss residue constrain dream-kin path; fog presses hull as unkindled solace, mirroring internal shifts and charging crow's nest ascent to garden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture shared narrative) tightens via braid-rope to garden, forcing trade-off acceptance of trapped freedom; agency in pulling threads forecloses singular self with felt dissolution cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of woven identities emerges via thread-braiding events; final "two voices sang in one throat" resonates as non-literal answer to conjoined shadow, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "threads from the air...vibrating with different versions"; rhythmic lyric voice modulates from drift to flame-catching closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (planks to pages, fog to ink) taught early and paying off at dissolution; minor density overload in sustained surreal beats slightly dulls propulsion but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chimera myth, carnival decay, and narrative-as-fabric; risk-taking surreal weave transforms tropes, with ship-to-story dissolution inevitable from early threads.</comment>
