<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the wrong-turn panic pressing against grief-driven resolve, earning the final painting choice with embodied cost in trembling hands and shell placement. Interiority particular via seashell tracing and cave "muscle memory." Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from cave entry density to CR closure in shell shimmer and painting resumption, reweighting grief with undeniable cost (shell dissolution, past release). Orientation anchored by word 50 (Elias at cave mouth post-Marguerite). Wrong turn causal pivot tightens without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and black-sand beach constrain wrong-turn choice and charge final easel setup image. Sensory hierarchy (salt-flower air narrowing to sunbeam) reflects painterly bias. No white-room; lived choreography in boot scrapes and pool wade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (promise completion amid loss) signaled in shell clutch; wrong-turn deepening forces endurance with legible cost (panic flutter, no retreat). Agency in forward press and shell reveal narrows options under Accumulative lens. Tide high on emergence pays forward pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" recurs from shell to cave oasis, reweighting impermanence without statement; final beam-shift image answers grief question non-literally. Emerges organically from particulars, ambiguity in "permanent impermanence" lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases to painterly negatives ("teeth instead of curtains"); rhythmic modulation peaks in shell "spiraling inward." Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in "frozen lightning" shards and "oils reacting" propulsion; rhythm varies read-aloud without loops or muddle. Minor figurative density purposeful in discovery beat. Zero scaffold, clean syntax propels to beam-shift cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cave grief-tropes transformed via biolum oases and shell alchemy into non-obvious CR. Risky lyric accumulation on impermanence feels inevitable. No templates; quay-painter lens freshens loss arc.</comment>
