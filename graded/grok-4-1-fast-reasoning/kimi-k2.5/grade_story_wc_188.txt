<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elian's contradictory impulses—feeling despair's "gravity" in his knees yet accelerating into a "caper"—act in the spiral dance, earning the closure renunciation of the mosaic with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as chant-fire-spiral density culminates in shard reconfiguration (CR), with legible conceptual cost of "burning the map to find the territory" on the final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mosaic floor as micro-setting constrains ignition via rainwater depression and charges closure shards, filtered through POV's ambient awareness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake against hopelessness deepens via knee-gravity pressure forcing chant acceleration under Accumulative lens, with knot exhaustion as on-page cost charging transmission image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final shards reweight "defiance" premise non-literally, answering via children's latent frequencies without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct "filtering" perceptual signature biases sensing (e.g., "despair pooling... heavy as mercury"), with rhythmic tightening in spiral modulating intensity cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in lines like "blue and gold tendrils... filtering upward through the fibers" advances propulsion and image without loops; varied rhythm supports spiral build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mosaic-frequency-to-shards synthesis transforms ritual trope via specific combustion logic, with risk-taking lyric payoff inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
