<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in daughter's disappearance compels weaving and sacrifice with embodied cost (fingers bleed, tears salt); final self-unraveling earned via prior failed recommencements, revealing hierarchy of maternal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from discovery to weaving failures to closure's charged poise (fabric lifts, body transparent); cost legible in "existence becoming the final thread," with orientation anchored early in orchard/bamboo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bamboo forest/orchard constrains via fibers and isolation, mirroring internal fracture; skeletal trees and rotting fruit charge final cyclone image, with sensory hush/sway selective to wistful perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message delivery) tightens accumulatively through seven recommencements narrowing to self-sacrifice; agency in persistent weaving forecloses life with visible cost, though external opposition subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love bridging raveling silence emerges via weaving particulars, reweighted in final image where sacrifice knits void without moralizing; resonance from blood/tears sealing unspoken farewell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in silence/weaving motifs; rhythmic prose ("clicked against the warp threads like bones whispering") modulates intensity, perceptual bias character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor overwrite in peak ("swirling with concentrated weight... holding its light steady") risks muddle; no loops obscure closure, phrasing propels to dissolving fabric.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of amber sounds, jigsaw shuttles, self-unraveling transforms loss trope; risk-taking in mythic texture heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pattern-taught silence/weave.</comment>
