<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism radiates through concrete actions like clutching the amber and rejecting institutional narratives, rooting motivation in particular traits. Interiority shows embodied doubt via the amber's weight as timestamp. Limited contradictory impulses acted simultaneously on page; group characters archetypal without distinct micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via convergence and data to CR closure in Vance's whisper ("Homecoming isn't a return; it's a reaction"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of eternal skepticism. Orientation anchored early (Elara at tower post-contact). Single scene scope fits defaults; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (bronze patina gleaming wetly, moss-softened arches) filter through skeptic's eye, constraining pilgrimage via overgrown path and tower shelter. Recurring rain evolves causally, charging final image of washing footprints. Environment shapes convergence and lab work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode homecoming chemistry) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through convergence and data readouts, narrowing to reconfigured perspective. Agency in tracing footprints and illicit setup; cost felt in refusal of stasis. One tightening via group arrival suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of home as artificial pilgrimage emerges organically from particulars like amber and footprints, culminating in resonant CR without moralizing. Final image reweights premise via synthesis of past/future. Subtext in Maya's nod enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with skeptic's perceptual signature (luminosity in evidence like amber light). Prose rhythm modulates from quiet description to hushed revelation; minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Seventy million years of stasis"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sentences advance via integrated image-action (e.g., amber under microscope). Minor figurative density in opening ("bronze quiet") risks overwrite but consistent. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms first-contact trope into psychological displacement via amber-fly metaphor and illicit pilgrimage. Risky lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
