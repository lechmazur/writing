<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode family mystery intensifies credibly through embodied actions like fingers separating fibers; heart quickens as pattern emerges reveals internal conflict between solitude and revelation. Micro-choices align with blithe traits under pressure. Final realization earns closure with conceptual cost of mapped sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from soil-wiping to tapestry decoding, culminating in CR closure where blueprint revelation reweights premise of cemetery as acoustic instrument. Orientation anchored early (Mara in graveyard evening). Cost legible in "geometry of sacrifice" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt silo with bullet-hole moonlight constrains solitary decoding and charges final image of folded tapestry under stars. Sensory details (groaning hatch, thick dust) filtered through gardener's tactile priorities integrate with action. No white-room; spatial choreography clear from ladder to stool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover ancestor's intentions) signaled early, tightens via emerging pattern that narrows to revelation under accumulative lens. Agency in untangling forecloses ignorance with conceptual cost. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice's geometry emerges organically from tapestry blueprint mirroring Mara's precise flower-arranging; final image of listening differently reconfigures prior echoes without moralizing. Subtext in misdirection sovereign case enriches complexity. Resonant non-literal answer to intentions' shape.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: thorns "known by name," echoes as grief dissipation. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from blithe humming to quickened heart, consistent under revelation pressure. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in decoding build tension); high density integrates image/action. Minor overwriting in repeated motifs ("velveteen gloom" twice purposeful but dense); no loops obscure closure. Propulsion clear to final folding image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tapestry code hiding acoustic blueprint transforms inheritance trope via textile mechanics and silo's isolation. Risky lyric compression of decoding pays off in hindsight-inevitable CR. No derivative templates; particulars like ivy/ravens anchor originality.</comment>
