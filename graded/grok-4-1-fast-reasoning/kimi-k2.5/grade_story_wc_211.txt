<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to archive emotions intensifies compellingly through embodied actions like placing wax under tongue; interiority concrete via sternum hum and unknown Linear A whisper. Internal conflict emerges in forgotten patterns resurfacing as prophecy. Minor slip in unearned epiphany ("the archive was not a library but a conversion") borders diagnostic without full struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from peculiar shaving to blossoms in autumn; on-page CR closure reconfigures life's work with conceptual cost in "orchard...rotating slowly around his heartbeat." Orientation anchored early in orchard/skyscraper. No lens ambiguity or shard excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting's rooftop orchard constrains via urban wind tremors and canopy immersion, charging final image of shuddering trees releasing petals. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (bark, moths, foghorn). Micro-setting (wax shaving as cartography) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive emotions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shaving vibration to memory immersion narrowing to prophecy realization. Agency in tasting wax forecloses mechanical archiving path with felt cost in bloodstream dissolution. Escalation coherent under lens, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of human feeling as vegetal memory emerges organically from particulars like wax-fed trees; final image ("ships would navigate by different stars") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in dead languages as pure frequencies lingers with ambiguity. No tidy resolution or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (moths pause, roots in Hittite); rhythmic modulation heightens immersion ("falling upward through the canopy while remaining perfectly still"). Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy realizations amid fluid metaphors); purposeful lyric figs like "velvet disquiet" propel without muddle. Minor overwrite in immersion paragraph ("memory shifted, becoming fluid") dense but pattern-taught. No loops, scaffolds, or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oath scribe, phonograph waste as prophecy, skyscraper orchard transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric build heightens stakes in CR without gimmickry; "blossoms that should not exist in autumn" inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
