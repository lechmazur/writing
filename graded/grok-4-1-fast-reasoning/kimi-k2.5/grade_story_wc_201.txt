<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via proprioceptive details grounds Elena's motivation to map mercy through pain's geometry, earning transcendence at closure. Contradictory impulses emerge in somatic memory clashing with forward movement. Minor abstract phrasing like "mathematics of mercy" borders on diagnostic but doesn't flatten pivotal body-led choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in strap snap and scar image, reweighting trauma with conceptual cost of "integral of pain divided by willingness." Orientation anchored early in forest awakening. One tightening suffices via clearing's "blinding white equation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>UV forest and body-as-micro-setting constrain proprioceptive navigation, charging final image where "roots dangling with silverware of suffering." Sensory hierarchy (hum aching teeth, pulsing bark) reflects urgency. Details evolve causally with movement, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy's math) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to blinding equation forcing stance crystallization. Agency in trauma-led navigation forecloses victimhood path with felt scar-cost at "light through a broken place." One deepening via somatic cascade suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trauma-to-mercy transformation emerges organically via pain's "geometry" to "inverse algorithm of compassion," resonating in non-literal final formula. Returning proprioception motif reweights without moralizing. Complexity lingers in scar's precise measurement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in micromovements ("exact angle of wrists") biases noticing toward somatic bias. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with intensity, compression taught early as forest pattern. No head-hopping; voice distinctively embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but metaphor density in peak (clearing revelation) risks coherence with mixed vehicles like "stars of damage"/"voltage generated." Minor paraphrase loops on "mathematics"/"equations" across paragraphs dull slightly. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioception, UV penance, and mercy's math transforms torture trope into navigational method. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes via body-forest coherence. Final "displaced rooted" image inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
