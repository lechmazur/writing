<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve hope roots choices like isolating stone frames and editing sequences, earning the shadow's metamorphosis; interiority particular via dusk-noticer lens but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the editing climax, softening peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density builds to editing realization and shadow's wing-like lift of the stone, delivering Charged Poise RR with legible conceptual cost in "forcing the transformation would break the spell"; orientation anchored early in library ritual; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent shelves and archival controls constrain editing choices and charge final exhale of petals/starlight; violet twilight and glass walls filter through dusk-noticer bias, mirroring internal transition without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving hope escalates accumulatively via anomaly pattern to editing tightens options with "softly deliberate" risk of breaking spell; agency in sequence arrangement forecloses destruction path with felt cost at metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hope's shadow-metamorphosis emerges organically from stone's journey and shadow's evolution, resonant CR in final flying-child image reweighting loss to guardian without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV with perceptual signature of light/dark boundaries; syntax/rhythm modulate from deliberate ritual to dawn urgency, perceptual bias sharp and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery without loops, purposeful "softly deliberately" refrain teaches pattern; varied rhythm propels to closure image, zero artifacts dulling stone-lift payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Shareable dreams as crystalline vaults and unbound shadow as hope's form transform surreal premise into inevitable stone-loop synthesis; risk in editing loop heightens stakes organically.</comment>
