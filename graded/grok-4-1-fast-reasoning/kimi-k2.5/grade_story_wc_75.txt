<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve arts intensifies credibly through concrete actions like cataloging fungal blooms and gathering elders; interiority particularized in "rosewater dread of beauty succumbing to entropy." Elders as secondary group apply collective resistance without deepening individual status dynamics. Final documentation choice earned by revelation, foreclosing silence with felt cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from beekeeper's departure to bread-map revelation tightening knowledge/options. Orientation anchored early in atrium/grotto. Closure as CR lands on-page in "some record would survive the deluge," reweighting preservation premise with conceptual erasure cost visibly felt in final documentation image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto setting (damp limestone, phosphorescent moss, falls' vibration) constrains choices via mold/entropy on artifacts and humidity on bread. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Elara notices cultural decay). Final image charges with calcite stairwells/lens magnifying ink against "coming dark."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue dying arts pre-isolation/flood) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bread revelation narrowing options to communal thaw. Agency in gathering elders/documents; cost legible in elders' "heavy" glances and "trembling hands." No live antagonist needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-thaw vs. erasure emerges organically from bread-map coordinates and lens on fading ink; subtext in "we cannot thaw the ice without drowning." Final image offers non-literal resonance: record survives deluge, reweighting heritage premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited POV with perceptual signature in cultured diction ("rosewater dread," propolis scent). Voice texture distinct: syntax modulates from descriptive to urgent ("her cultured diction cutting through"). Announcement dialogue goal-driven, echoing stakes; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; metaphors coherent ("black rivers devouring woven rivers") without muddle in peak revelation beat. Minor overwriting in opening sensory stack, but woven into action; no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image of "trembling hands" on manuscripts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bread initials as navigational archive transforms refugee trope via grotto specifics. Bread revelation turn inevitable from prior cataloging; risk in metaphorical thaw heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; singular vision in dying arts preservation.</comment>
