<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's forgiving skepticism drives contradictory impulses from doubt to mercy, embodied in clutching the tooth and splinting the arm; final dual mending earns her transformation with cost to old certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from maze entry to fountain reveal and dawn mending; closure CR lands in "stitched together from old wounds and new understanding," reweighting skepticism with legible personal cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Secret garden's impossible geometries and iron/lilac scents constrain path to yew roots, charging final constellation image; sensory hierarchy reflects Elena's biased perception narrowing to bone-work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with bone-setting and astronomical mercy; hedge maze as constellation inevitability transforms tropes boldly.</comment>
