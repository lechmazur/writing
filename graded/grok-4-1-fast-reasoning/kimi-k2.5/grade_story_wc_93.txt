<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via curse's visions compelling the final step into the field; embodied interiority strong in "futures unfolded behind his eyes before they existed, each vision burning like collapsed star dust." Minor slip: internal conflict more summarized than simultaneous impulses acting in scene, slightly unearned at closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to aurora's 4:47 touch and CR closure ("He stepped into the field... became the pattern"); cost legible in "scatter his consciousness across time." Orientation anchored early (tidal bluff, post-Smoothing); single scene, one tightening via final stone suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frictionless world vividly constrains via "boots smeared with eel-slime" for traction and stones generating "temporary friction"; tidal bluff/aurora charges final image of permanent friction pockets. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (eels' paths, visions); no white-room, all integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise via patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as curse reveals cost ("understanding them would scatter his consciousness"); agency in stepping into field forecloses path with on-page price. One deepening via alignment suffices under lens; cost unmistakable at dispersal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterns in loss emerges organically via math sequences and star dust revelation ("inscribed in the mathematics of loss"); final image reweights premise without moral ("stones remained... charging the rocks with enough memory"). Resonant, non-literal answer to sacred patterns question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (precog visions as "burning like collapsed star dust"); rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at "I understand," with purposeful lyric compression taught early. No head-hopping; diction biased to herder's math/eel lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/scaffold; propulsion strong in climax ("Star dust swirled around him, stinging where it touched"). Minor figurative density ("shadows that fell upward") risks slight muddle in peak beat but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless physics, precog curse, math-harnessed star dust feels inevitable; bold risk in topological field payoff transforms tropes. Final reconfiguration ("eels rose... dispersed into the borrowed light") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
