<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Internal conflict excels in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—"rigid one" vs calculating deception—earned by prior honesty vs father's influence; final choice to deploy ink forecloses innocence with felt cost. Minor slip in abstract diagnostic phrasing like "mathematically honest mind ache" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands on-page in final smile/calculation reconfiguring justice calculus with conceptual cost to innocence; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from vigilance to breach opportunity. Single scene oriented early (prep room, shift change); one tightening via 2:17 guard spotting narrows to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prep room's "chemical preservation tanks and hum of refrigeration" constrains waiting tactic and charges final "chemical glow"; ink pot as micro-setting tool handled tactilely shapes choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects mathematical POV bias toward precision (e.g., "seven minutes ahead").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (asylum via ink) tightens via agency-driven vigilance spotting guard breach, foreclosing stealth/force for precise drops; cost legible in innocence trade-off. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with cadence shift to movement, narrowing options without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of "mathematics of a fair trade" emerges organically from con/redemption tension, resonant non-literal answer in final image reweighting secrets' worth vs innocence without moralizing. Complexity lingers in ambiguity of justice as "another con"; prior particulars like ink formula anchor insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mathematical filters ("trajectory of justice," "algebraic proofs") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from reflective to propulsive in "moved through the shadows." Stable close third-person POV with no leakage; voice coheres under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated detail, but overwriting in figurative strings ("sugar in warm rain," "oil on dark water," "skeleton key") muddles peak planning beat coherence (−0.6); minor "waiting actively" loop drags rhythm once. Read-aloud varies effectively overall; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious ink compound synthesizing con artistry with chemical agency transforms asylum trope via precise moral calculus; risk-taking in "liquefies rigid thinking" heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from father's history, no derivative echoes.</comment>
