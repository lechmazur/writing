<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Mara characterization with embodied actions like tracing the vial and concrete motivation to catalyze healing; architect's grief shown via red-rimmed eyes and blueprints, with earned change in shoulders dropping. Minor passivity in architect limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to perfect stillness; closure as Conceptual Repricing in vial clearing with emotional cost legible ("dissolve the calcified architecture of regret"). Orientation anchored early in prism terrace transit; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting specifics like resonators and thermal currents constrain choices (adjusting trim) and charge final image (crystals settling). Sensory hierarchy via Mara's professional bias vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of catalyzing silence comfort escalates accumulatively via noise drop to negative three decibels and crystal lattice; agency in Mara's adjustments forecloses grief path with felt cost in architect's breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as alchemical presence emerges organically from particulars like feathery crystals and velvet vacuum; final image reweights regret dissolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in fluid observations (dendrites feathering); voice rhythmic and biased toward acoustic precision. Sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven ("Listen").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Purposeful repetition of "vaulting hush" and "fluidly logical" builds texture but creates minor paraphrase loops; overwriting in stacked metaphors ("drowning in velvet") dulls peak density slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of atmospheric silence-healing in inventive prism terrace world; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via vial's lattice payoff.</comment>
