<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief via mask's cutting edges and restricted breathing, with micro-choices like spiral scattering revealing values; internal conflict between destruction and preservation earned through ritual. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("alchemy of grief") borders therapy-speak but anchors to present actions without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ash-scattering density builds to Charged Poise closure; final image of mask on chair reconfigures preservation premise with conceptual cost of permanent loss ("would never return"). Orientation anchored early (Elias in gallery as chair stops); no shards, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vanishing point gallery constrains forward steps and charges final image; porcelain mask as micro-setting restricts breathing and embodies grief evolution. Sensory selectivity (ash settling into cracks, shards warming) mirrors POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallize emotion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deliberate spiral and final handful tightening to chair's stillness; agency in wearing/ removing mask forecloses illusion path with felt cost. No reversal needed under lens; pressure coheres to ending reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of destruction-for-preservation emerges organically from ash-to-art ritual, reweighted in final realization without moralizing; mask/ash images shift from illusion to acknowledgment. Resonant non-literal answer in chair-placed mask avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (artistic bias in ash/porcelain noticing); rhythmic modulation builds intensity without head-hopping. Lyrical diction consistent, voice-motivated for grief's texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("weaves/weaving truth carefully," "incomplete information") and repetitive ash-scattering stems create mild scaffold across beats (−0.6); no closure harm, metaphors coherent (ash as snow). Read-aloud propulsion strong otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unique ash-scatterer ritual transforms grief tropes via porcelain/gypsum specificity; fresh premise (burn portrait to save via ash) risks bold alchemy without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in textured lyric heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
