<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of contradictory impulses in shadows writhing with "strain of holding the courageous anomaly," earning the final choice; prior micro-choices selecting mirrors root motivation holistically. Hairline slip in early label "calmly intuitive" before full dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of mirror glimpses tightening to triangle configuration; on-page RR closure in "Light erupted... crystal now whole" with legible cost in shadows' strain. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse/orchard/ice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vintage mirrors and geothermal roots constrain choices (redirect heat via shafts), charging final image of chiming mirrors and nomads ascending. Sensory selection (aurora greens, groaning ice) reflects intuitive POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard vs. nomads) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through fragment warming and mirror alignments narrowing binary options; cost unmistakable in "shadows... writhed... with the strain."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of refusing either/or emerges organically via third-path configuration, final image of whole crystal and released breath reweighting premise non-literally. No moralizing; complexity in empathy's "executable strategy."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature in shadow-sensing and intuitive currents; rhythmic modulation peaks in climax's terse "Light erupted." Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to closure; no loops or artifacts, metaphors cohere (mirrors as "glimpses... adjacent possibility"). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene's poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timeline mirrors and crystal refraction transforms dilemma ingeniously; risk in non-causal glimpses heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "new geometry of solution."</comment>
