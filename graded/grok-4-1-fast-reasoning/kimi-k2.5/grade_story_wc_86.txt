<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Negotiator's motivation to recycle mistakes into wisdom drives concrete micro-choices like practicing the drawer pull signal and deliberate key insertion, earning the exchange's closure. Interiority embodied in "counting the seconds between lightning and thunder" reveals thoughtful trait without abstraction. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+; relationships crucible with delegates adds pressure without headcount blur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation anchors parapet/mist/moon by para 1; density builds to exchange as RR/Charged Poise with cost in "fragile success into tomorrow's deeper wisdom." Single scene, one tightening via simultaneous arrivals narrows suspicion. Closure cost legible in final "counting heartbeats," reconfiguring fragile peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mist, wet stone, waning moon constrain visibility/choices, charging final image of negotiator alone. Sensory hierarchy (wind steals words, shackles clink) reflects urgency; POV bias filters diplomat's desk pull. Micro-setting (parapet polished smooth as bone) mirrors theme, evolves with retreating figures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prisoner release amid suspicion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via signal halt and key unlock foreclosing betrayal path. Agency in "raised the antique drawer pull" and speech forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in scout's tremble and delegates' glances; minor abstractness in "phase of restoration" slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of recycling failures into mercy emerges via drawer pull's evolution from diplomat's death to scout's redemption, reweighting history without statement. Final image answers restoration question through "suspended breath... architecture of peace." Subtext in mist erasing borders invites ambiguity; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV, perceptual signature in moon/tide metaphors biases toward thoughtful negotiator. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("moon witnesses"); rhythm modulates with wind/gale intensity. No head-hopping; diction purposeful, eliding backstory anchors present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "coat snapping like a flag of truce in the gale" advances voice/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked figures during exchange ("pendulum between apology and forgiveness") risks coherence but pattern-taught. No loops; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms prisoner exchange trope via moon-synchronized mist/parapet and salvaged brass signal, synthesizing ritualistic poetry with stakes. Drawer pull's reprise feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens fragile peace without gimmick. Fresh angle on negotiation as "recycling mistakes."</comment>
