<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal internal conflict peaks in "seductive pull of false comfort" vs. "ferocity," with contradictory impulses (replication urge resisted via brutal precision) acting simultaneously; final societal gestation earned by prior mental strain, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from memory collision to bottle compression, delivering on-page CR via "bottle shattered soundlessly, not outward but inward, collapsing into a singularity"; conceptual cost legible in magic's obsolescence, constraint shapes entire tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Skeletal piers" and "tide-smoothed stones" constrain reconstruction on rotting dock, mirroring internal alchemy; final "streets mapped by rational geometry" and lanterns recharge setting, fulfilling 9+ test via environmental evolution charging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (innovation over replication) signaled early, deepens via "ache of her concentrated mind" forcing trade-off; Accum lens cadence shift narrows to authentic creation, with visible mental cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of limitation-alchemy emerges organically; final "lanterns floated upward... weight of making wishes obsolete" offers non-literal resonant answer to magic-loss question, reweighting premise without moral, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with alchemist-biased perceptual signature ("neural architectures of remembrance, rotating... like a complex equation"); rhythmic modulation under stress maintains diction coherence, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "every calculated angle... compressing empirical knowledge into the vessel's sealed geometry" advances multiple layers without loops; varied rhythm propels to "tasted of copper and invention," fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Post-wish cognitive-alchemy synthesis transforms ghost revival trope via "gestating the future within a shell that magic could not penetrate"; fresh inflection inevitable in hindsight, risk heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
