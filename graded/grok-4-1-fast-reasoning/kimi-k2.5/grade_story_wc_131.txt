<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation rooted in sense memories and traits drives methodical choices with embodied emotion; grandmother's kitchen cue anchors reflection tilting present actions. Internal endurance earned via final cache and retreat shows hierarchy of values with cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak placement beat slightly limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via successive findings/caches reweighting stake. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. CR closure via final grate cache and retreat image makes before/after legible with conceptual cost of perpetual invisibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ventilation pipes and crawl spaces constrain movement/choices; sapphire hush and flickering lights charge final image mirroring internal state. Sensory hierarchy (touch of dust/tape, steam on pipe) reflects Maya's priorities. Recurring fragments handled tactilely evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility to vulnerable) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through caches narrowing to final rare books room placement. Agency in distributions forecloses personal visibility path with felt retreat cost. Visible tactic shifts via targeted locations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of invisible evidence emerges from caches and voices ("I survived"); final walls-humming image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in artifact persistence vs. her retreat carries conceptual cost. Complexity in care amid hiding avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (magnetic fields as sense triggers); diction/rhythm modulate from hushed lyricism to charged poise at "Maya smiled." No dialogue. Purposeful compression in actions maintains texture under determination's "pressure."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short declarative placements amid longer sensory builds). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("metallic insects," "arteries") dense but coherent, no loops or muddle touching closure. Fragments repetition purposeful under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of infrastructure dweller seeding survivor voices transforms trope of hidden homeless into network of sustenance. Risky lyric frame on tapes as vessels heightens stakes organically. Final evidence-leaving reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
