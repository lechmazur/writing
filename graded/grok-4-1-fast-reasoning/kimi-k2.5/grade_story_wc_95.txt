<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mechanical arm's torque enables pivotal parry and alignment, revealing character under pressure; relationship crucible forces truce from opposition. Contradictory impulses subtle in Aldric's philosophical riposte during duel. Minor flaw: Silas slightly archetypal, but actions distinguish.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrival → duel → alignment → decode → shared purpose as DC with exertion cost. Orientation anchors immediately (atrium, brook, waiting). Single scene, no shards; closure cost legible in "breathing hard."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Half-painted sundial constrains duel positioning and charges decode; shadows and brook murmur pressure choices. Sensory hierarchy (whirring arm, ringing steel) POV-specific. No white-room; evolves with sun.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode overture) signaled early; causal tightening via duel torque forcing sundial alignment forecloses opposition. Silas lunge narrows options; cost in physical press and breath. Entry gate met but minor abstractness in philosophy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (chaos as dignity, questions to destinations) emerges via sundial/needles reprise, reweighting premise without statement. Final truce image answers non-literally. No moralizing; irony in "fought for before heard."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Aldric bias on arm/shadows); distinct voices in syllogism dialogue. Rhythmic control peaks in duel ("steel ringing"); subtext in "diplomatically fierce." No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax in duel beats; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrites in metaphors ("fractured prism," "compass points") but purposeful, not muddled. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fencing philosophy, needles/sundial code; risk in unfinished art as invitation transforms trope. Inevitable hindsight from vectors to expedition. No derivatives.</comment>
