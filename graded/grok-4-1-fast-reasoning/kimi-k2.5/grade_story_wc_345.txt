<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's trust in the ghost despite struggling with silence shows contradictory impulses acting in scene; final understanding of hauntings as love earned by prior guidance-following with embodied cost (permanent chill). Ghost's altruism deepens through chalked directives constraining group choices. Interiority particular (frost in bones), no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: messages build density to nebula bloom (RR/Charged Poise) with legible cost (imperfect protection, risk of collapse) in dawn climax scene. Structure fits two shards (past messages to present action) with taught pattern; orientation anchored early (orchards, Kepler-442b crash). No ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain choices (align anomalies, highest point for bell); watering bell as micro-setting charges final image (rings for rounds, connects veil). Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-biased (frost crunch, iridescent chalk shimmer). Nebula evolution mirrors internal respite without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant survival stake signaled early (ghost guidance); accumulative escalation via chart reexamination deepens knowledge, narrows to collective midnight action forcing trade-off (risky sanctuary). Agency in leading/orchestrating; cost unmistakable in "brambled hope" with thorns/losses charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (love/family across veil) emerges organically from chalk messages, bell reprise, nebula as cultivated respite; final image ("rang the bell again, sending droplets") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting strangers-to-family arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (alien soil chill, shimmering chalk); rhythmic control modulates from dawn chill to radiant hope. Lyrical diction purposeful, biased to Mara's priorities; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "crunching frost" advances setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/stacks. Minor figurative density ("dying stars," "brambled hope") in low-pressure opens but purposeful, coherent, untouching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sci-fi ghost engineers survival via chalk/atmospheric nebula from orchard arches; risk-taking in accumulative haunt-as-love transforms tropes. Inevitable in hindsight via message pattern to bloom.</comment>
