<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in childhood loss drives micro-choices like positioning at nexus and speaking into watch; interiority concrete via embodied "cautious exuberance" expanding in chest. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses caps below 9-band, as caution yields to steady progression without deep friction shown in pivotal documentation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of imagery tightening to CR closure: final image of second letter's arrival reconfigures her from seeker to composer of silence, with felt cost of sealed fate undeniable in "mist that now accepted her documentation." Orientation anchored early; pattern of reversal taught and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-corridors and breathing shelves constrain choices (nexus positioning, vapor cartographies); recurring watch charges final inscription beat. Sensory hierarchy filters through veil/POV bias purposefully; environment evolves with cyclic reversal, mirroring internal unfolding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map lexicon in six hours) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening realizations that narrow options to reverse documentation; agency in speaking into watch forecloses expulsion path. Cost legible in timeframe pressure, charging final acceptance image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths emerges organically from particulars like mother's unuttered goodbye and negative-space pages; final CR reweights premise—silence composes futures—with resonant ambiguity in her dual role as archivist. No moralizing; counter-readings linger in confidence man's fate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (spectra through veil, backward prophecy); rhythmic prose modulates from cautious to trembling anticipation, stable close third-person POV with clean free indirect texture. Purposeful compression of reversal motifs taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor overwriting in stacked mist/propagation metaphors (e.g., "frozen fireflies," "living script") risks coherence in mid-documentation beat without stronger pattern payoff; rhythm varies, no loops, zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backward-time library and cipher elevates tropes into inevitable CR; risk-taking in surreal cyclic architecture heightens stakes organically, transforming prophecy into composition without gimmickry.</comment>
