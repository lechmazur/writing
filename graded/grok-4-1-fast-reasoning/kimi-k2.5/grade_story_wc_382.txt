<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to learn the building's language drives micro-choices like fingering molding and pressing the seal; Elias's spectral traits force unacknowledged acceptance of "agreed upon lies." Earned change in her integration, with embodied tension in doorframe stress fractures. Minor slip: Elias's death handled via implication without deepening contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through meteor showers and rituals to CR closure: Maya's seal press rearranges bricks' syntax, with conceptual cost of becoming vocabulary. Orientation anchored by hallway and rooftop early. One tightening via sugar pretense to tea sessions narrows interpretive options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop garden during meteor showers constrains choices by enabling cosmic translation and final seal press on copper flashing, charging closure image. Sensory details (warm concrete, gurgling pipes) filter through Maya's perceptual bias toward architectural language. Setting evolves with showers, mirroring deepening understanding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding building's language) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Elias's lessons and desk seal revelations that reweight her knowledge. Agency in pressing her own seal forecloses outsider status with felt conceptual cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive intensification sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of dead languages and "agreed upon lies" emerges from particulars like cornice pronouns and spectral pretense, culminating in resonant final image of mortar including her name. Subtext in unacknowledged ghosting invites ambiguity without confusion. Non-literal answer reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature (alphabetic grooves, structural confessions). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., Elias's opening line continues "decades ago" pretense. Rhythmic control modulates from static hum to building sigh.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "bricks rearranging their syntax") propels accumulative texture; varied rhythm avoids monotony. Minor overwriting in opening figurative cluster ("alphabetical grooves," "dead tongues") slightly dulls early propulsion, but closure image clear. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral tutor teaching architectural dead languages transforms ghost trope via "agreed upon lies" premise. Bold risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens conceptual stakes; final seal press feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
