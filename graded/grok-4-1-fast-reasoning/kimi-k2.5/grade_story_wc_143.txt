<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in her refusal to retreat amid hypothermia ("wrapped her arms around her suit's heating coils"), earning the final endurance with visible bodily cost; interiority particular via scientific curiosity without epiphanies. Minor abstraction in "melancholy certainty" avoids peak perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly: night-to-dawn progression tightens via pattern break at "first razor-thin crescent," landing CR closure in "dawning hush remained eternal" with conceptual cost of archived extinction. Orientation anchors immediately; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Summit micro-setting constrains endurance choice against "minus one hundred seventy degrees," charging final image as "blazing summit, now stripped"; sensory hierarchy (regolith crunch, UV bloom) reflects inspector's bias. Recurring ejecta rays evolve causally with descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness pristine crater) signaled early, deepens texturally via dawning light revelation that forecloses preservation option; endurance agency pays cost in "heart seem thunderous," drills complicating without resolving. Legible pressure culminates on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity archiving loss emerges organically from chemical plaque and photo, final image ("proof that someone had cared") offering resonant CR repricing without moralizing; particulars like fusion-glass veins avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in chemical/scientific diction ("potassium ferricyanide," "interference pattern"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "shadows stretched and bled," heightening hush without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("smeared across a titanium plaque"); varied rhythm propels via short peak sentences ("Silence thickened"); no loops, minor figurative coherence in "cathedral of gold and obsidian" serves hush without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar sci-fi lit via oxidation messages and sand-grain timer transforms mining trope; risk in lyric hush payoff feels inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
