<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's warmly methodical traits drive precise micro-choices like tracing strands and reconfiguring braids, revealing values under pressure; change to active participant feels earned via prior archival motivation. Minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limit exceptional depth—no strong internal struggle in the weaving climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from door's appearance to rope reconfiguration, landing RR closure in the sigh and fading door with legible cost of role evolution ("archives forever changed"); orientation anchored immediately in clock tower at midnight. Single scene holds without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rope braids and gears constrain choices (groan and shift during reconfiguration), charging final image of treaty on workbench; sensory details (warm hemp, pendulum rhythm) selective via archivist POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timeline merge) signaled early, tightens via night-long density increase to seal placement under accumulative lens; agency in weaving forecloses war-path with felt cost (paradox resolved), but lacks deeper reversal narrowing options mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence inverted to presence emerges organically via fables and braid manipulation, protagonist arc inextricable; final image of smooth gears and united territories offers resonant non-literal answer ("absence was merely presence inverted") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with archivist perceptual signature (e.g., "silences between them," "three-dimensional manuscript"); rhythmic control modulates from methodical to reverent, diction purposeful without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and reflection without loops; minor overwriting in metaphors like "cartographic key to such impossible cartography" risks coherence in peak reconfiguration but doesn't obscure closure. Varied rhythm propels to dawn merge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival time-weaving via rope braids transforms trope of hidden doors into ingenious temporal cryptography; risk in abstract "negative space" topology pays off inevitably at treaty appearance.</comment>
