<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's warmly observant trait drives concrete micro-choices like noticing rust and shadows, revealing interior contradiction between speechlessness and vigilant connection. Final cairn-building renunciation of the unsent letter earns stasis with felt cost of preserved anonymity. No unearned epiphanies; impulses act simultaneously in pausing before the lamp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from sea glass recognition to jar-sealing cairn, landing Charged Poise closure in ghost's final jar-holding with endurance cost of isolation. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room constrains choices (dark sanctuary enables ghost-sharing, gallery rail for cairn); phosphorescent mist and rust bloom filter through Elara's priorities, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under fog-lit urgency; no white-room or checklists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect anonymous safety) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sea glass message to jar-sealing, narrowing to endurance with visible cost in foreclosed direct communication. Agency in cairn arrangement forces trade-off; cost legible in "hollow where vigilance met vulnerability."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of safety in vigilant anonymity emerges organically from cairns and jar, final ghost image reconfiguring premise without moralizing—cost in perpetual watchers/ watched. Resonance from particulars like toppled stones; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (currents over grammar, shadows' deliberation); rhythmic modulation peaks in "luminescent ache" without head-hopping. Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor overwriting in stacked figures ("salt-cold curiosity," "bruised twilight") during cairn beat borders purple but pattern-taught as voice; no artifacts touch final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cairns-as-letters and bottling-safety synthesize isolation trope freshly; sea glass/jar reprise feels inevitable, risk-taking in lyric ghosts heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: specifics irreplaceable.</comment>
