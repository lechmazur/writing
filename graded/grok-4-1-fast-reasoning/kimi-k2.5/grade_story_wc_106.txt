<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (believing/not believing her golden hour) act in scene, culminating in earned endurance at the bench with felt cost of perpetual waiting. Interiority concrete and embodied ("heart pressing against her ribs like a fist"). Final listening moment reveals hierarchy of values without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands on-page in final bench image, reconfiguring quest with conceptual cost of unarrived destiny under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored early (Elara at Emerald Station, golden sunset). Time constraint tightens meaningfully ("ninety seconds remaining"). Lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald tiles constrain movement (silent boots), moonlight charges final cathedral image. Sensory details selective/POV-biased (brass like suns to her thief's eye). Light evolution (golden sunset to silver moon) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steal illuminated portrait) signaled early, tightens via flower-predicted time pressure ("three stems meant three minutes"), foreclosing delay with on-page cost of rushed exit. Accumulative density reweights internal quest for destiny. Agency in micro-choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image (jar leaning to portrait, ear to destiny's door) offers resonant non-literal answer to stolen light/awaited change, reweighting prior illuminated moments. Theme emerges organically from particulars without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers plausibly (believing/not).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light as soul-truth, savvy codes) with rhythmic control modulating from tense theft to poised wait. Stable close third-person; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; metaphors coherent/patterned around light (silver fights gold). Minor figurative density in theft beat doesn't obscure pressure. Closure image crisp, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief trope via moonbeams, flower codes, soul-portraits feels inevitable; transforms heist into luminous quest. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes, charges destiny image without gimmickry.</comment>
