<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Julian's synesthetic motivation and micro-choices (withdrawing coin, singing) compel the climax effectively; Mara's change feels earned via embodied despair ("shoulders curled like sheet music left in rain") and coin touch, though her interior lacks one contradictory impulse under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered echoes building to Charged Poise closure; coin touch aligns timeline with legible cost ("transfer of potential," selves folding) in final lines; oriented early (Rialto/maze by para 1), no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden/tree constrains climax (Mara sits beneath, cutter left at roots, coin deposited); synesthetic details (violet arias, golden threads) filter through Julian's bias and evolve with echoes; spatial choreography clear (drifts through wall, rustle to central tree).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lure from despair) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dimensional echoes narrowing to coin transfer; agency in Julian's singing/coin spin forecloses Mara's path with on-page cost (cutter abandoned); pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive echoes emerges via particulars (amber applause ribbons to rose-colored crescendo); final image (coin gleaming for next soul) offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting fractured presents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature (despair as "flat gray notes," satisfaction as "cinnamon and old velvet") biases noticing distinctively; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short sensory bursts in climax); stable single POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful synesthetic metaphors (no muddle, coherent pattern); minor figurative density in peak echoes ("turquoise harmonies") risks slight overwriting but propels to closure without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost/timeline orchard transforms tropes via grounded coin bridge and echo mechanics; fresh premise (performance splinters as redeemable vibrations) risks bold perceptual mode, heightening closure without gimmickry.</comment>
