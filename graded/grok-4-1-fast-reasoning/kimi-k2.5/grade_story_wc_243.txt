<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied, with hesitation in dipping pen revealing contradictory impulses toward preservation amid dissolution; final endurance of witness earned through micro-choices like reverent steps. Gently thorough trait constrains actions without labels dominating. No therapy-speak; flaws in inevitable forgetting compound gently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure in final image of capped inkwell and homeward turn, reconfiguring remembrance with cost ("preparing her heart for the next blooming"). Orientation anchored early (Mara on blooming jetty). One tightening via fading twilight narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooms constrain choices (no crushing) and charge final image of closing petals; sensory hierarchy (spores tasting of photographs) POV-filtered through archivist bias. Jetty's incline and fog evolve causally with descent. Micro-setting (inkwell, locket) tactile and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate covenant before dark) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via light drain and thick blooms forcing careful tactics; agency in documentation forecloses collapse path. Cost legible in "destruction traveled through chains of tiny events." Tightening via tide shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory's fragile physics emerges organically from ink-fading mercy and bloom cycles; final non-literal resonance in locket touch reweights image-dependence without moralizing. Particulars (walnut scent, petal cheekbone) avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in entropy's honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (grief's salinity altering gravity) modulates rhythmically to peak stress; POV stable, inference modest ("not magic but physics"). Compression taught early, pays off in charged final cadence. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (syntax breathes in ritual slowness, accelerates in light-drain); no loops, varied openings, metaphors coherent (blooms as "paper lanterns"). Minor figurative density purposeful, not muddling closure. Read-aloud rhythm matches emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic botany and grief-physics transforms loss tropes via archivist's proximate causes; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in blooming ritual. Inevitable hindsight in covenant regeneration from small documentation. No derivative templates.</comment>
