<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "her terror of enclosure warring with her determination," driving the precise strike as earned defiance with embodied cost in tightening lungs and shaking hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: organ thrum stills walls, enabling entry; faltering music triggers closing, forcing DC at gear strike with legible cost in "screamed and locked" mechanics and her terror.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pulsing limestone and narrowing throat constrain timing and strike; oculus starlight charges final climb, mirroring liberation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake signaled early (key ends hunger); causal tightening via organ window narrows options, culminating in agency-driven transfixion with visible cost in grinding stones and waring terror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of measured defiance emerges organically via compass precision against "tyranny of forgotten machines"; final image reweights premise as "quiet monument to... measured defiance" without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in geometric precision ("calculated the angle") and fear-biased noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks crisply under stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action (bones ache from thrum); minor figurative density ("breathing depths," "jealous hearts") in climax risks slight muddle but stays voice-consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living architecture and organ resonance transforms dungeon trope; compass-as-liberator risks bold ingenuity, heightening stakes through mathematical rebellion.</comment>
