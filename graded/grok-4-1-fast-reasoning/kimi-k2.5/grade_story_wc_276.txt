<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cool-headed fisher's steady pursuit shines in micro-choices like zigzagging and voicing silence, with embodied emotions (anxiety etched on spike) rooting motivation. Internal consistency drives the climax plunge without contradiction. Minor abstraction in "transliterate" phrasing slightly distances peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ripples to garden hush and echo solidification around spike as DC/RR closure. Orientation anchored early (Kael in sound wave garden at pattern-break hour). Cost legible in collapsing garden and wandering stars, reconfiguring sky as "blank as a fresh page."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains zigzag navigation and echo capture, with sensory details (infrasonic humming, visible ripples) filtering through fisher's priorities. Echo pool charges climax; collapsing flora evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch echo) signaled early, escalates via density increase under Accumulative lens: stars' stampede tightens timeframe, forcing null-song plunge. Agency in silence-voicing forecloses scattering path; cost in un-mendable patterns and "hunter and hunted" marking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wild divinity amid breaking order emerges from particulars like feral lullaby echo and spike etchings, reweighting premise in final "godhood into something mortal" without moralizing. Resonance in garden's quiet reclaiming ties to fisher's witness-role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (transliteration, voicing silence) modulates rhythm under stress, from meditative zigzags to climactic hush. Poetic diction taught early as voice-motivated pattern, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "transliterate" motif propels via varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative saturation in climax (silver phonemes tasting ozone) coherent and pattern-taught, though risks minor overload without obscuring spike plunge payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of sonic garden, emotion-metal transliteration, and pattern-break transforms tropes into inevitable fisher's quest. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes, with spike fusion as fresh, hindsight-earned turn.</comment>
