<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to harness ephemeral roots all micro-choices, from climbing stairs to triggering leaf playback; embodied in stained fingers and trembling hands. Interiority concrete via leaf memory cue tilting present action. Final transcendence as earned stasis shows contradiction resolved with luminous ache cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tremors to photon pressure, pattern break via leaf sync reconfigures chaos into clarity. On-page RR (Charged Poise) in final lens adjustment with "luminous ache" cost legible. Orientation anchored early in observatory shake; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lunar observatory micro-setting constrains via trembling beams and chronometer, charging final image; leaf reel as tool enables sync choice. Sensory hierarchy (stars whispering, leaf descent audible) reflects POV urgency. Body (worn hands pooling light) mirrors internal state purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture ephemeral amid unrest) signaled early, tightens via leaf realization narrowing to frequency solution under textural lens. Agency in playback forecloses evacuation path with transcendence cost. Escalation coheres to cadence shift reweighting stability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral as falling/flight emerges from particulars (leaf descent syncing spin, light in hands); final CR reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance in "to keep it was to lose it" image lingers with ambiguity. Organic via character arc inextricable from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (photons as breath, light pooling valleys); rhythmic modulation peaks in closure. Lush diction biased to optics trade (aperture, silver nitrate). No elision or head-hopping; voice heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "brass arm slowing to match the tempo"); metaphors coherent (light as water/dam, escape as falling). Minor figurative density in tremors beat but pattern-taught pays off; varied rhythm, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar optics and acoustic transcendence transforms sci-fi trope; leaf as frequency stabilizer inevitable from memory setup. Risky lyric escalation via sound/image heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; singular vision.</comment>
