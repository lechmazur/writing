<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to graft onto community is clear and intensifies through offerings to bridge, but lacks dramatized contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; weeping at Joss's glyph provides strong embodied sympathy yet summarizes internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as isolation density builds to kinship via tags/search/discovery, with CR closure at "final barrier...dissolving like sugar in rain" reweighting premise with cost of 17 cycles' loneliness; orientation anchored early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard, obsidian boulders, and crater gap constrain choices (e.g., spanning the gap with bridge) and charge final image; sensory details like "air tasted of copper and old songs" integrate purposefully through Kael's biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of connection signaled early escalates accumulatively via shared search to discovery/deepening, narrowing isolation options with felt cost of prior starvation; agency in sculptures/bridge forces trade-off crystallized at dedication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of art outlasting loneliness emerges organically from search to bridge, with final image offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation without moralizing; subtext in fragile webs tightening carries complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "geometries that whispered of drowning"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, elision taught early as lyric compression pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion, no loops/artifacts; figurative language coherent and pattern-taught in lyric mode, though dense in dedication beat stays legible without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic world (glass trees, silver glyphs) transforms isolation trope via tag-map of connections; risk in lush lyricism heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
