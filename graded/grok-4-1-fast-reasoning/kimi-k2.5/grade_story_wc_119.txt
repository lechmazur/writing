<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to transpose life drives concrete micro-choices like inserting microdots, earning his shift from isolation to mastery; blind spots create earned irony without safety-hedging. Internal conflict emerges in paradoxical belief versus unfolding reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds revelations to Conceptual Repricing closure in final image of boat departing, reweighting premise with cost of orchestrated escape legible in "shift in his bones like a key change." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam and rocky island constrain message delivery and charge final image, mirroring internal modulation; sensory details (rotating beam, crashing Atlantic) selectively filter through Elias's perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of isolation vs. unconscious mastery tightens accumulatively via revelations and knock, narrowing options with agency in directing flow; cost felt in foreclosed island permanence crystallized at ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of accidental prophecy emerges organically from particulars like cookie insertions and beam sweeps, resonant CR in final symphony image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with musical perceptual signature; syntax modulates rhythmically with realizations, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High figurative density borders overwriting in realization beats (e.g., repeated key/music metaphors create minor muddle); conceptual paraphrase loops on "directing flow" and "open secret" dull propulsion slightly, but rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unwitting spymaster via prophetic cookies transforms tropes; risk in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via lighthouse beam finale.</comment>
