<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's richly perceptive trait enables concrete micro-choices like positioning the shell at a precise angle, earning her crystallizing decision; contradictory impulses surface in consent outrage vs. preservation weight. Archivists apply targeted pressure without diluting her dominance. Backstory on sister anchors present stakes effectively under BRR.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying hum and revelation density to Charged Poise closure: "She would ensure... echo became choice, not capture," with conceptual cost of bridging exploitation vs. honor legible in final singing image. Single scene oriented early; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sandstone purchase, starlight columns, and dust constrain descent and shell angle, charging the precise positioning beat; cosmic hum felt in teeth embodies perceptual narrowing. Final nexus weaving mirrors internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to learn echo origins tightens accumulatively as shell translates voices/sister, forcing stance crystallization on preservation ethics; agency in raising/lowering shell forecloses exploitation path with felt relational cost. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration pre-revelation tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of echo as seed vs. capture emerges organically from sister shimmer revelation and Mira's honor decision, reweighting preservation premise in final "sing her sister home" image without moralizing. Complexity lingers in consent ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (hum in teeth, reed-blown voice) modulates rhythmically under pressure; brief Archivist dialogue carries subtext naturally. Lyrical diction sustains lyric mode pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "bare feet finding purchase on sandstone worn smooth"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or artifacts dull closure image despite opening figurative density. Minor register elevation fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Acoustic geometry imprinting consciousness transforms preservation trope via canyon specifics and shell mechanics; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric resonance heightening closure without gimmickry.</comment>
