<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to share light without fire roots actions consistently and earns dispersal change at closure; sentimental interiority concrete via gear/sonar but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal cavity moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sonar echoes to gear realization; CR closure via gear-pressing and self-dispersal reconfigures cycles with legible conceptual cost in final luminescence image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nebula garden and falling petals constrain transit path and charge bioluminescent closure; sensory details (hydrogen petals, sonar vibrations) filtered through sentimental POV bias mirror internal patterns purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gentle illumination tightens accumulatively via cavity revelation narrowing violent repeat; agency in gear-pressing forecloses destructive path with dispersal cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of non-consuming light emerges organically from gear/light-fire motifs; final glowing petals offer resonant CR reweighting generational premise without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of cosmic sentiment (e.g., watercolor ghosts); rhythmic cosmic diction modulates intensity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images but figurative stacking (gear's "spectral rainbows") risks minor muddle in deepening beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gear as infinity-approximating lantern transforms cosmic cycle tropes into fresh lyric synthesis; risk-taking in accumulative CR heightens stakes organically.</comment>
