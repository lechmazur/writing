<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in tinker's traits drives ritual commitment, embodied in rusty voice clearing and fingers dancing on vine; interiority concrete via grease-smudged chronometer and sympathetic resonance. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ test, but micro-choices reveal values under alignment pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from checks to cosmic click and growth burst, yielding RR closure in dawn exhale and stretching growth with felt cost of decades' silence. Orientation anchored by arbor/dawn/chronometer in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (mint/old magic/sap moving) filters through tinker's priorities, constraining ritual on stone altar; arbor/vine/chronometer charge final image of fruitful branches, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore practices) signaled early, escalates via alignment cadence shift narrowing to moon's click and song's intensification under Accumulative lens; agency in humming-to-singing forecloses neglect path with land's exhale cost, legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from song stitching "narrative and nitrogen," reweighted in final image of remembered rituals stirring bones; resonant non-literal answer to covenant breach without moralizing, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (gears/mint/lavender bias); rhythmic diction modulates from hush to "audible click," purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "voice rusty at first, then clearing as the melody resurfaced"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence in "threads of light and sound," zero issues in peak vine-burst beat for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinker-priestess spinning stories as nitrogen remedy transforms harvest ritual trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes via vine's memory, inevitable in hindsight with closure payoff.</comment>
