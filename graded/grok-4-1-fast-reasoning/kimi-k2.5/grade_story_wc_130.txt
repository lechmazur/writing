<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between mourning and hope act through trembling fingers tracing fissures and pressing eyes to stone; final endurance earned by inventive alignment yielding transcendent mapping. Interiority particular via "mathematics of emotion" obsession rooted in sister's tools. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal values under absence pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from faint gleam to spectral equations, culminating in CR closure: "the equation was never broken," with emotional endurance cost legible in chest-beating certainty amid unchanged loss. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elian in cavern orchard post-moon silence). Single scene coherence perfect; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cavern orchard's dripping stalactites and pale pears constrain kneeling/tracing and charge final water-through-stone image mirroring optimism. Sensory hierarchy (silver gleam, damp air, mineral dust) filtered through inventive POV bias toward geometry. Details evolve causally with drop's ripple extending "beyond physics."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify grief for resolution) signaled early, tightens via drop's "new tributary" shifting chaos to constellation, narrowing to proof of persistent love under Accumulative lens. Agency in adjusting eyes/angles forecloses binary death/return with felt endurance cost. One deepening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of love bending absence emerges organically from glass eyes/stone fissures/drop, reweighting grief via non-literal final image of "water finding its path through stone." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in transcendence without recovery. Protagonist arc inextricable from emotional calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of mathematical refracting (e.g., "spectral equations," "vectors and angles"); rhythmic modulation builds to hushed revelation. Prose texture distinct in syntax echoing invention (e.g., "threading the needle between acceptance and faith"). No head-hopping; elision purposeful for lyric poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., drop striking "precisely where two cracks intersected" advances revelation). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite figurative density—purposeful for textural lens. Minor elevated diction fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes as grief refractors in math-infused cavern transforms loss tropes; "dovetail joint" in understanding inevitable from inventive groundwork. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick; conceptual integrity commits to ambiguous endurance.</comment>
