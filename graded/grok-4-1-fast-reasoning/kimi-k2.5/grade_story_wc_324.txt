<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to protect voices drives descent despite knowing she should wait for backup, earning the shift to rescue with embodied tension in her hammering heart. Thomas's brief appearance reveals character through clutching the hearing aid like a talisman. Minor abstraction in epiphanies like "incidental heroism" slightly dilutes contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: hearing aid pulses → child voice → descent → discovery, culminating in DC closure as Elena leads Thomas out, photograph slipping as visible cost of reunion. Single scene with seamless stair transition fits scope. Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium constrains choices (hush demands movement, seeps into basement) and charges final image (bells toll, dispersing mist). Sensory details like thumping pulses and damp air filter through Elena's priorities. Spatial choreography clear from atrium to basement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Mrs. Gable's voice) tightens via agency: pulses lead to hearing Thomas, forcing solo descent with felt risk. Cost legible in "should have waited for backup" and final realization shifting her career view. Escalation causal under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of amplifying vulnerable voices emerges via hearing aid bridging dead/missing, resonant in final bridge-like photograph without moralizing. Incidental heroism reweights premise in closing lines. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in pulse/throb imagery; voice modulates poetically under stress without leakage. Minimal dialogue natural ("It's safe now") and goal-driven. Rhythmic control heightens hush to climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax and sensory density; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("radioactive with consequence," "bird-bone fragile") in discovery beat slightly muddles without harming closure. Propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of supernatural tracer premise with grounded emotional rescue transforms ghost story tropes. Hearing aid as memory conduit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky poetic realism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
