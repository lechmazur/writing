<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's fractal perception uniquely motivates and enables prophetic mural, with limits driving embodied struggle to precise edge in painting beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure: mural as eternal sky internalized amid demolition, cost legible in unaverted tree fall and final memorization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tree trunk's rotting textures and spiral shelves constrain ascent/painting and charge final trailing fingers, mirroring internal fractal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dawn hush tightens dominant stake of sky-mirroring, escalating via perceptual density to renunciation: art over salvation, cost in proceeding engines' roar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of internalized fractal sky reweights limits/discovery as preservation's cost, emerging organically from perceptual particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable fractal-textural POV signature modulates stillness to urgency, with rhythmic diction biasing toward tactile patterns throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense, varied syntax propels without loops or muddle, peaking in fractal stroke description with zero artifacts touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tactile coin-encoding and fractal face-blind mural transform preservation trope boldly, synthesizing into inevitable perceptual eternity.</comment>
