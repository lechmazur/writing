<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via chronicler-specific textures ("rough velvet of moss") and embodied contradiction (methodical cataloging amid "dangerous clarity"); final weeping choice earned by graffiti linkage to sister, foreclosing suppression with raw cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("medication had been a dam") doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries densify to Charged Poise closure in final playing/weeping image ("each discordant note... rippling outward"), reconfiguring stance with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (rust, piss, ivy "green fingers") through chronicler POV biases; ivy recurs to mirror conquest in final image ("ivy continued its slow conquest"), constraining choices like soft floorboards/navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness path) signaled early, tightens via graffiti recognition ("hands trembling... recognition") deepening knowledge/options under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "wept, and the sound was raw solace."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (rivers deposit silt/forgive dams) emerges organically from graffiti ("current only flows forward"), accordion patch, and final image ("depositing it... into bedrock"), resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (textural chronicling: "particular rust scent"); rhythmic modulation peaks in closure ("wounded note at a time"), no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative braiding ("grief and relief braided") purposeful in closure beat, no muddle or scaffolds dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: off-meds chronicler maps guilt via graffiti/accordion in ivy station transforms redemption trope; risk of solo lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via river conceit.</comment>
