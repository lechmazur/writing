<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via tactile tracing of latitude lines; motivation shifts organically from treasure to dissecting lies, culminating in earned reconfiguration when journals "broke her heart and healed it simultaneously."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of realizations tightening to CR closure; orientation anchored early on barge canal; sundial shadow revelation drives pivotal walk without causality breaks, cost legible in emotional dualism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sundial gnomon constrains choices through shadow alignment; mud "smelling of rotting lilies and iron" grounds bank exit tactilely; canal reflection mirrors internal settling, charging final dust image without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to salvage truth deepens accumulatively via instinctual reading and false-map training; one tightening at engraving reveal narrows options to real grave; agency in tilting to horizon forces renunciation with felt heartbreak cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lies' architecture emerges implicitly through distorted maps training true perception; final image of sundial on knee offers non-literal answer reweighting deception as toolkit, with conceptual cost in self-authored legend.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in navigational metaphors like "confidently lost stride"; rhythmic control modulates from twilight serenity to dawn crack; diction elevated but voice-coherent, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative overload in realization beats ("quiet violence of paradigm shift," "molecular structure") risks coherence without obscuring closure; minor "architecture of lies" loops deduct lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial encodes real grave over fictional temple, transforming quest trope through hindsight mechanics; risky reflective accumulative structure heightens ingenuity without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
