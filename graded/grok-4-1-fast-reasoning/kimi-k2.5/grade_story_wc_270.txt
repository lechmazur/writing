<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied telepathy and aching joints root motivation in specific traits, compelling the unseal with contradictory impulses toward tradition versus evolution; final smile as bridge earns change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via plant-guided discoveries to kite code and amber split; CR closure reconfigures stasis into growth with conceptual cost of cracking safety, legible in surging plants and kite's flight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hot springs constrain precise thermal sequence and ache joints, charging final nursery image; sensory hierarchy (hissing vents, crystallizing minerals) mirrors urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unseal tightens via decoding reversal, narrowing to embryo release; agency in lowering amber forecloses preservation path with legible cost in violent churn and feedback overload.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of intent-driven evolution emerges organically from particulars, answered non-literally in tendrils unfurling and gratitude sunlight; reweights amber preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (roots against stone, lightning/chlorophyll) modulates rhythmically; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and voice without loops or muddle; rhythm varies (short urgent sentences in churn crescendo), propelling to kite flutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, bio-engineered embryo, and kite cipher transforms tropes; risk in vegetal-human contract heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
