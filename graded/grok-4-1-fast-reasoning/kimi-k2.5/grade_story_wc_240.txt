<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's spatially gifted trait drives concrete interiority and micro-choices like tracing hyphae amid Eli's proximity, earning her release; Eli applies relational pressure without flattening her agency. Minor epiphanic phrasing ("art of release") borders therapy-speak but embodies via overwhelmed calculations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from Eli's silhouette to mycelial observation, landing CR closure in laser offering and brighter glow reweighting possession with surrender's cost. Orientation anchors early; glass constraint persists, shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm vividly filters through Maya's expertise (hyphae lattice, azure caps), constraining choices (quarantine barrier) and charging closure (mushrooms' indifferent glow mirroring letting go). Sensory hierarchy sharpens under emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defend vs. release) signaled in laser tremble, deepens via Eli's pilgrimage reframing to foreclose possession; agency crystallizes in "Show me" whisper and step back under Accumulative lens. Cost felt in relational physics rewrite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mycelial exchange emerges organically as theme of generous connection, resonant in final image's non-literal repricing (bioluminescence undiminished by giving); no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in transparency without passage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (spatial mapping bodies to fungi) biases noticing; dialogue subtextual (Eli's palm test), distinct idiom. Rhythmic modulation peaks in charged silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated sensory images; purposeful lyric metaphors (galaxy of stars) cohere without muddle. Minor elevated diction fits voice, no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fungal networks as relational physics transforms ex-lover reunion; bold Accumulative lyricism risks paying off in CR without gimmick, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
