<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kai's phobias drive contradictory impulses acting in scene—tremors decrypt notes, acrophobia aids positioning—earning final outwit with relational cost on father. Interiority embodied via shaking hands clarifying smudges. No label-speak flattens peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: birth certificate discovery → observatory decryption → footsteps tightening to lunge/rail wobble DC, then sirens Charged Poise RR with autonomy cost legible in "they descended... sirens approached." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted railing/beam and stars constrain choices, charging climax dodge and final image; plaster cast as micro-setting enables decryption via phobia-filtered perception. Sensory narrowing under acrophobia vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit via vulnerability) signaled early, causal escalation tightens via decryption reversal narrowing options to environmental ploy, agency forecloses murder path with father's vertigo cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as power) emerges organically from phobia decryption to rail ploy; final image reconciles seashell halves as CR reweighting premise. Closing line "vulnerability... its source" borders echo but earned via action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with phobia-biased perceptual signature (stars as "crushing weight"); voice rhythmic under stress, dialogue subtextual in "You built me... not about fearlessness." No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers traced... through tears" advances plot/character/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure. Minor "trembling" recurrence voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: phobia as decryption key transforms stunt-double trope, risk-taking in vulnerability-powered outwit feels inevitable; no derivative echoes, closure boldness heightens stakes.</comment>
