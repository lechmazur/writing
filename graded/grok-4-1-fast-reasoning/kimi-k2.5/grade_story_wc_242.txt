<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to teach estrangement is concrete and consistent, embodied in her precise hang-ups like with the sobbing accountant. Internal conflict emerges subtly in her own isolation amid connections. Final endurance of severing the teenager's call earns closure with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of wrong-number calls builds density toward Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchors immediately in tunnel/booth. Final image of disc spinning and Mara waiting reconfigures endings-as-beginnings with conceptual cost of perpetual isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel drips, streetlamp hums, and third rail corpse constrain and amplify Mara's work, mirroring her loops. Recurring grates filter light, evolving with electrical handoff. Disc flaw charges final rotation image, narrowing perception to tactile resonance under her philosophy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching estrangement escalates accumulatively via caller density (accountant to teenager to elderly man), culminating in hang-up refusals. Agency in guiding then severing forecloses dependency with legible emotional cost. Disc scratch forces precise timing, tightening options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of endings-as-inversions emerges from disc skips and severed calls, not statements. Final image of tunnel breathing and steady hum offers non-literal resonance, reweighting estrangement as blooming garden without tidy moral. Subtext in "every goodbye contains the architecture of hello" lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, with perceptual signature of city-as-exhaling-loneliness (booth as throat). Voice modulates rhythmically with disc rotations, diction biased toward harmonic overtones. Dialogue sparse but subtextual, like whispered lessons pursuing estrangement goal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate sensory propulsion (drips matching disc) without loops, though minor metaphor density in peak calls risks slight overwrite. Rhythms vary with scene calm, read-aloud ear strong. Final line recharges motifs cleanly, no scaffold or artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted rotary phone in derelict tunnel transforms wrong-number trope into philosophical switchboard. Risky lyric accumulation of motifs heightens isolation stakes organically. Disc's cracked flaw as enhancement feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
