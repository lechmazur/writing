<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find beauty in the unfinished drives consistent micro-choices like playing gaps between notes, embodied in her acoustic perception; interiority feels particular through vibration imagery. No on-page internal contradiction acts simultaneously, limiting to very strong rather than exceptional. Solo POV earns change via endurance of incomplete world with felt cost in final understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds vibrations to shipwrecks humming, culminating in Charged Poise RR where hush transforms into potential with conceptual cost of honoring fragments over restoration. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. One tightening via hush cracking suffices; closure cost legible in "silence... full of potential."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain choices via driftwood fuel and resonant hulls, charging final image of breathing sanctuary. Sensory details (barnacles, humid air, thermal hum) selective and POV-biased toward acoustics. Environment evolves with flames and vibrations, mirroring internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unbind chronic hush signaled early, tightens via sympathetic vibrations narrowing to transformed silence under Accumulative lens. Agency in deliberate unfinished notes forecloses restoration path with cost of praising partial world. Escalation driven by protagonist's ritual, cost unmistakable in retained harmonic memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in decay emerges from particulars like rust, rot, half-notes, reweighted in final bowl as vessel of sound over sustenance. Resonant non-literal answer in transformed hush without moralizing. Complexity embraced in world's incomplete healing, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with acoustic perceptual signature in noticing frequencies and ghosts in droplets. Voice texture rhythmic and selective, modulating with intensity from setup to peak hum. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at lyrical closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with sentence length, propulsion strong in ritual beats; high density integrates image/action. Minor paraphrase loops in "magnificent simplicity" (twice near end) and repetitive vibration motifs subtract slightly, but pattern-taught and purposeful for lyric mode without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc acoustic ritual unbinds silence via bowl-drum violin, transforming decay tropes through specific resonance logic. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in gaps/unfinished, inevitable in hindsight at charged final image. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
