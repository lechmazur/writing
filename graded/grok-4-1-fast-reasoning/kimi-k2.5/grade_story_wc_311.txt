<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reaper's motivation to name fears roots consistently in grief traits, intensifying to ritual choice; interiority concrete via monster embodiments. Embodied emotions contradict (intimacy/untouchability). Minor slip: early passivity delays micro-choices until atlas positioning, but closure endurance earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from recordings to light ritual, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "holding the named fears... like a lantern against the void" with felt endurance cost. Single scene oriented early (aperture, dusk); no shards/transitions needed. Closure cost legible in crumbling atlas and scythe reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's cracked lens/prisms constrain ritual via scattered light beam, charging final crystal beasts image. Sensory hierarchy (light/dust motes) reflects reaper's cosmic bias; details tactile (fingers through leviathan). Environment mirrors internal geometry of grief purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via recordings → atlas ritual narrowing to endurance. Agency in positioning/naming forecloses erasure path; cost visible in "distant intimacy... neither touching nor releasing." Enters 8+ via option foreclosure, but no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of naming formless grief emerges organically via ritual; final image reconfigures sacrifice as map/comfort without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (monsters → constellations); subtext in untouchable forms invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from echo of sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (grief as cosmic voids/monsters); voice rhythmic/poetic modulates to precision at naming. Diction character-specific (astronomical metaphors); no head-hopping, elision purposeful/legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring ritual build; no loops/scaffolds, metaphors coherent (light crystallization). Minor overwriting in light/prism density during peak (−0.3), but clarity intact, rhythm read-aloud strong. Zero artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: reaper myth transformed via astronomers' sacrifice/light ritual into grief geometry; sea monsters as fears inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes (+0.3); no derivative echoes.</comment>
