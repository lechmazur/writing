<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like feigning drunkenness to get close, earn the final devotion; contradictory impulses in caution vs boldness act simultaneously. Minor flaw in label-like "curiously steadfast" phrasing dilutes particularity without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising through repeated maneuvers to Charged Poise closure—Mara emerges with fob "heavy with evidence," cost felt in tide pressure and foreclosed violence. Orientation anchors instantly; single scene coheres without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pier's "creaks against the pilings, counting down" and swaying lanterns constrain false starts and charge final image, filtering through Mara's urgency; sensory hierarchy (tide smells, vibrations) mirrors bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to record betrayal signaled early, escalates accumulatively via enforcers and agent's scan narrowing options; agency in feigned stumble forces trade-off with visible time cost felt in "dawn creeps closer."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as "ammunition" emerges organically from fob's grooves etching betrayal, reweighted in final "sound of trust breaking" reprise without moralizing; daughter's arc inextricable from devotion vs treachery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile fob warmth and shadowed scans; rhythmic modulation under stress, minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("Pretty," reaching).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but patterned loops in "false starts" (5x) and "comforting unease" (3x) create mild template cadence, dulling peak momentum without full payoff; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phonograph-fob disguise in hush-truce market transforms moonshine betrayal trope; risk in feigned vulnerability heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
