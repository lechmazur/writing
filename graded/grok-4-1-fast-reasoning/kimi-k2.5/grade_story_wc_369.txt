<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in tree-secrets quest drives micro-choices like dream-mapping; embodied healing and heart-hammering ground emotions.

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from vial-shelves to pin-drop tightening; Conceptual Repricing closure in tree-whisper reconfigures sorrow-system with conceptual cost of deconstructed preservation. Orientation anchored early in labyrinth night-shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Heartwood labyrinth and moonlight constrain choices (healing hands for sextant-work); stormlit tower tree charges final image with bioluminescent hum. Sensory selectivity reflects Elara's priorities.</comment>
