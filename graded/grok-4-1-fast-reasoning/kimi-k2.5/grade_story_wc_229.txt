<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation intensifies through embodied restraint ("screaming tenderness of withheld breath") to the earned closure choice of deploying the cork, revealing contradictory impulses in his five-year shadow role without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of subtle signals builds to Charged Poise closure ("weeping with the violence of his own quiet"), with cork placement as pivotal causal turn reconfiguring Voss's brute method; orientation anchored early, cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse and Fresnel lens constrain choices (brass receiver modification, warm stairs ascent) and charge final beam image ("cobalt melting into gold"), with sensory details (iron-taste dawn, jasmine vapor) filtered through Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers save) signaled early tightens via cork deployment narrowing to quiet agency over Voss's shouts, with emotional cost ("five years as the whisper") charging ship’s beckoned turn under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of tenderness over force emerges organically from jasmine method vs foghorn, resonant in final image ("tenderness...screams louder") reweighting premise without statement; counter-readings (Voss's dream) add complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (subtle frequencies, purifying scents) modulates rhythm under climax pressure; purposeful lyrical compression taught early pays off in legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm ("hummed like a lullaby sung through clenched teeth"); figurative language pattern-taught from opening integrates without muddle or loops, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse trope via jasmine-cork vibrations transforms shouts-vs-whispers into tactile intent signals; risk-taking in experimental receiver heightens stakes organically to inevitable closure.</comment>
