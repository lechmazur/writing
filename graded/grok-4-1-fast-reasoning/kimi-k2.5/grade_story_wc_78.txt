<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation intensely clear and consistent, rooted in years of storm interpretation and embodied in mallet strikes; survival alchemy feels earned. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, reducing internal conflict depth—no micro-choice reveals value hierarchy under peak storm pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rhythm density builds from single strike to fractal waves merging storm, landing Charged Poise RR closure as storm collaborates. Orientation anchored early ("outermost ring of the orchard afloat"); one seamless scene fits scope. Final dubbing image ("storm...ceased to be an enemy") carries conceptual cost of endless restless cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driftwood orchard constrains choices—creaks under strikes, roots transmit rhythms—affecting survival tactics; charges final image as trees sing in resonance. Sensory hierarchy vivid and POV-biased: bruised cumulus as percussion, rain on mallet shaft. No generic placeholders; evolves causally with storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform storm threat) signaled early, escalates via density increase under Accumulative lens: strikes layer to visible harmonics, narrowing to dubbing climax that reconfigures enemy to collaborator. Agency in persistent playing forecloses disintegration path; cost felt in "restless" spirit and orchard's fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (obstacles as latent music) emerges organically from strikes turning squall into chorus, resonant in final image of unresolved chord without moralizing. Particulars like fractal waves and sketched resonance reweight premise; invites ambiguity of endless storms as "songs waiting to be born."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: clouds as "percussion section," waves in "fractal generating" idiom; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short strikes building to dance). Stable third-limited POV; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "Russian dolls carved from resonance" purposeful in pattern-taught lyric mode, varying rhythm supports euphony. Minor overwrite in peak beats ("sketched resonance patterns now filled the air") risks muddle but doesn't obscure closure image. Rare paraphrase loops ("restless euphony" reprise voice-motivated).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maritime dub, fractal acoustics, floating orchard transforms storm trope into prophet's alchemy; bold lyric risks heighten stakes without gimmickry. Final "instruments not yet struck" feels inevitable from early particulars. No derivative echoes; fresh premise commits fully.</comment>
