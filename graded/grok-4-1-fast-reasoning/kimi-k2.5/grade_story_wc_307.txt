<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied regression via softening hands and dissolving certainties creates particular interiority; final endurance of vanishing feels earned through prior causality. Minor weakness: contradictory impulses more implied than simultaneous in pivotal ripple-reading.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to Conceptual Repricing at "delayed revelation settled... becoming both the student and the teacher in reverse"; cost legible in on-page vanishing image. Orientation anchored early in floating platform/grotto; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto's pulse anchors spirit and charges final image of magnetized teachings; sensory hierarchy (teeth ache, silver milk starlight) filters through regressing POV. Setting constrains trance suspension between gravity/levity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of backward teaching tightens via ripple density to realization, narrowing from certainties to pure questions; agency in stone-casting forecloses linear time path. Cost felt in regression's full vanishing by dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear time/vanishing emerges organically from ripples/stone; final backward-rippling stone reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from withheld rings recharging earlier patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of young-old gaze (memories as predictions); rhythmic syntax modulates trance intensity. Voice distinct in biased noticing of magnetic pull on blood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with trance cadence, high density integrates action/image; purposeful metaphor pattern (ripples as scripture) taught early pays off without muddle. Minor overwrite in "perfect violence" but coherence holds to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Backwards-aging premise synthesizes regression as methodology with fresh ripple-time logic; risk of pure lyric pays off in hindsight-inevitable CR, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
