<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mutation as "blessed pariah" roots motivation in embodied contradiction—survival via stretched perception enables mapping but enforces agonizing isolation; final step earns closure via prior causal endurance of temporal resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stretched sounds to fixed point discovery tightening stake; Charged Poise closure ("stepped forward into the shimmering threshold") lands with conceptual cost of isolation-as-key legible in hatch glimpse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observation deck constrains via elastic time stretching gestures ("painful negotiation with elastic time"); recurring compass warms in resonance, charging final pin to sketch; sensory hierarchy (distorted echoes, smeared stars) biases via stretched vision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. bearings) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fixed point reversal narrowing options; cost legible in biological scream of centuries endured, but minor abstractness in "turn crushing confusion into exploration" slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ancestral mapping reconfiguring chaos emerges via sketch evolution from memorial to methodology; final image (compass-pinned coordinates) offers non-literal answer to navigation premise, reweighting pariah curse with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in stretched-time bias ("seconds expanded into agonizing hours"); rhythmic modulation under stress consistent, but occasional elevated diction ("pneumatic finality") borders POV lexicon without full grounding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload ("taffy-like resistance," "sugar in acid rain") in opening beats borders coherence muddle (−0.4); no loops, clean syntax, but density slips dull minor propulsion in mid-sketch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal mutation as cartographic gift transforms isolation trope; risk in stretched perception topology feels inevitable, heightening stakes via family custom payoff without gimmick.</comment>
