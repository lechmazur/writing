<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as mapkeeper drives precise actions like tracing ripple-marks and adjusting pitch via ice cracks, earning her endurance at closure. Interiority concrete (stone "like trapped bees") and embodied. Minor slip: limited on-page contradictory impulses, as competence dominates without shown flaws complicating the singing climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mapping to singing, manifesting bloom as Charged Poise RR—"quiet would hold as long as she remained to tend it"—with legible cost of ongoing vigilance. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early ("Mara descended into the harmonic caves"). Closure image reconfigures chaos to hush without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harmonic caves vividly constrain: stalactites hum D-minor, ice cracks meter pitch adjustments during climax singing. Echo chamber stone charges final image, pulsing "steady and calm" as beacon. Sensory hierarchy acoustic/POV-specific; details evolve causally (cracks seal victory).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjure hush vs. chaos) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: discordant crack reveals need to invert song, density peaks in bloom expansion recoiling beings. Agency in micro-adjustments forecloses passive wait; cost felt in "must tend it," charging poise. One tightening sufficient and pivotal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of crafted silence via geometry emerges organically from particulars (ripple-maps, inverse frequencies, ice runes), answered resonantly in final "hammered repose" image reweighting chaos without moralizing. Subtext in expanding null-song implies patience's conceptual cost. No tidy resolution; ambiguity in tending lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: acoustic bias ("concentric circle a record," "stored vibrations thrumming"). Prose texture lyrical-rhythmic, modulating to intensity in singing beat. No elision or head-hopping; diction POV-plausible, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion strong via integrated sensory/action ("palms against... feeling... thrumming"). Minor artifacts: "gently luminous" and "examining crack patterns in ice" repeat in mid-climax without full pattern payoff (-0.4), but density high, no loops obscuring closure. Figuratives coherent ("ink in water," "beaten copper").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic geometry (ripple-maps, inverse hush) transforms sci-fant invasion trope via cave physics, inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric precision heightens stakes; final ice-sealing recharges premise without retreat. No derivative echoes; voice commits boldly.</comment>
