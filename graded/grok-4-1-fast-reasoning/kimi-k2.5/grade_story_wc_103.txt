<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as maze designer drives precise perceptions of geometry and time, earning the surrender at "he must become part of its topological structure." Interiority is particular but emotions skew perceptual over embodied contradiction, slightly flattening peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in disintegration and merge, cost legible in "his atoms distributing along the hyperbolic plane." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic living bridge garden constrains paths and charges final image, with cambium-embedded halo mirroring temporal folds. Sensory details (rhizomatic pulse, quaking air) filter through Elias's expertise, evolving causally to his dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of time) tightens accumulatively via retrocognitive trap and halo touch, narrowing to disintegrative choice with legible cost in bodily loss. Escalation peaks agency-driven at "stepped deeper into the hyperbolic maze."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time's jagged texture emerges organically through garden's layers, resonant CR in "rough bark against yesterday, smooth pollen against tomorrow" reweighting merger without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (geometric biases like "rhizomatic intelligence") modulates rhythmically under stress. Elevated diction consistent and voice-motivated for lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax, but figurative saturation ("chemical whiteness," "vectors tracing asymptotic paths") borders overwriting in climax beat without obscuring closure. No loops; rhythm supports quaking tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic botany, retrocognition, and transcendent merger transforms tropes, riskily committing to crystalline time's cost in "jagged, crystalline, fracturing" payoff image.</comment>
