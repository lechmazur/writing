<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in penance, shown through tactile repair choices; competence balanced by guilt's weight, earning final endurance. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with tightening density in repair beats toward Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "her own anchor to lift from the seabed of her guilt." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Water basin as micro-setting constrains choices and charges final image; mist and depot sounds evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Recurrent fog pressures departure timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timely repair) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via decoding under time constraint; agency in micro-choices forecloses failure path with felt guilt cost. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of broken-to-guiding emerges organically from refraction method and anchor motif shifting to redemption; final image reconfigures loss into purpose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tactile perceptual signature; rhythmic control heightens calm under pressure, diction biased to vibrations and sounds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sense, and emotion without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels, though occasional lyrical elevation risks minor drift in peak repair.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness-as-superpower via refraction transforms repair trope; risk in sensory prosthesis pays off in inevitable closure image.</comment>
