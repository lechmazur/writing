<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to discover connection intensifies convincingly through weaving to self-merger, embodied in palm piercing without blood; minor weakness in absent contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning declarative over conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to CR closure where Elara disperses into architecture ("physical form dispersed") with conceptual cost of boundary erasure; deliberate early disorientation pays off without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Optical illusion gallery constrains weaving via shifting eyelets and illusions stitched together, charging final image of visitors walking "through her ribs"; selective sensory integration mirrors internal flux purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively through pattern complexity to eruption, narrowing options to self-surrender with legible cost in dispersal; agency in final thread pull forces trade-off effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection's texture emerges organically from weaving events, answered resonantly in final "fibrous, tensile... copper and salt" without moralizing; reweights real/imaginary boundaries non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct surreal perceptual signature ("shadows fell in directions that contradicted") stable in single POV, rhythmic control modulates intensity; purposeful compression taught early, legible at merger.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively, motifs like "unsettling calm" purposeful without loops; figurative density borders overwriting but pattern-taught early, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architect merging with impossible geometry feels inevitable from sinew-weaving premise; risk-taking in surreal logic heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
