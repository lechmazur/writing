<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional: involuntarily truthful trait compels pivotal reveal ("compulsion rise in his throat like honey"), earning unburdening with cost against corporate silence; contradictory impulses act in scene via compulsion vs preference for silence. Engineer's thinness minor as pressure coheres without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from riddle/bee to engineer's widened eyes and sealing boxes as CR, reweighting blackout as "birth" with conceptual cost of preserving dreams vs routine; orientation anchored early ("lightning collection tower...city-wide blackout"); one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exemplary: sensory hierarchy (ozone/burnt honey narrowing to clover/copper) filters via Elias's priorities, tower constrains ascent/reveal, nectar dusk charges final violet image; recurring amber/liquid gold mirrors internal wonder without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong dominant stake (preserve wonder vs corporate scrub) signaled early, tightens via truthful reveal narrowing options (truth flows "like liquid light"); agency in handing matchbox/box forces trade-off, cost felt in unburdening as she descends carrying truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resonant emergence: riddle reweights "potential...trapped in routines" answering theme of failures birthing dreams; final sealing boxes offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, complexity in corporate grind vs poetry lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber light...liquid gold") biased to wonder; stable single POV, dialogue subtextual ("real danger...bees") advances under pressure; rhythmic modulation peaks in reveal without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("liquid gold...liquid light") purposeful in textural lens without muddle or loops touching closure; no scaffolds, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: truthful toll keeper preserving dreaming drone bees in nectar dusk transforms sci-fi tropes via specific riddle/bee evolution; risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
