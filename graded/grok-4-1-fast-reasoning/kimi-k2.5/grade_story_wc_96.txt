<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's molting trait creates embodied contradiction, straining against transformation during the tin exchange, earning the final reveal with visible relational cost to Marcus. Interiority concrete via personality as "armor" and loosening skin texture. Minor slip in stock epiphany phrasing like "perfect response" at Marcus dialogue, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density layers from sorting to exchange to reveal, tightening via guard shift and molt admission into Charged Poise closure where tin opening reconfigures persistence amid chaos. Orientation anchored early (Elias, library, night). Cost legible in "Elias might wake as a stranger" line before final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted shelves, open-sky yard, east wing soil constrain choices (sorting under moon visibility, hidden exchange). Moonlight evolution mirrors internal states, charging final zenith reveal. Selective sensory bias via poet's texture focus (cracked spines, old skin).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver seeds for resistance rebuild) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tin slide and molt confession narrowing recognition option. Agency in lingering fingers on catch; cost felt in impending forgetting and guard risk at closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of creation over destruction emerges via book/seed parallels, resonating in final "resistance bloomed in spaces between words" without moralizing. Subtext in silences during sorting. Minor overtness in repeated "luminous fracture" but charged by tin reveal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person Elias POV with poetic perceptual signature (meter in sonnets, skin loosening). Dialogue subtextual (tin query without lookup) distinguishes voices. Rhythmic modulation peaks in short, stressed final sentences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tapped the coffee tin" advances plot/character/object). Minor paraphrase loops in "rebuilding" motif (books/world) purposeful under textural lens, no scaffold. Slight overwriting in metaphors like "blooming resistance" near end dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Molting poet + tin seeds in prison library transforms resistance trope into fresh synthesis of identity flux and cultivation. Risky quiet closure via image (tin reveal under moon) heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from early personality curse payoff.</comment>
