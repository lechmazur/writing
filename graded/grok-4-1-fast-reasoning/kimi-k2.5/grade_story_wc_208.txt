<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to reimagine her art intensifies credibly through slide discoveries, with embodied reactions like heartbeat syncing to archway hum. Interiority concrete and artist-specific, but multiple unearned epiphanies ("true structure emerges") dilute contradiction under pressure. Final change earned via micro-choices in wood assembly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from slide projections to wood synthesis, culminating in CR closure ("no longer needed satellite guidance") with conceptual cost of yielding control. Orientation anchored early (storm, archway by para 2). Single scene coherent, one tightening via lantern teachings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm, archway, and driftwood constrain choices (shelter forces collaboration; hum as metronome) and charge final image (archway as "teacher"). Sensory hierarchy artist-biased (grain encodings, barnacle scars). Micro-setting (slide, wood) evolves tactilely through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine art post-GPS fail) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via slide's layered insights forcing synthesis over imposition. Agency in wood arrangement forecloses resistant path with felt cost (trusting material's language). Escalation coherent under lens, no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of timewoven alliances emerges organically from slide images and wood work, resonant CR in final pavilion plan without moralizing. Subtext in yielding to forces reweights particulars. Minor overtness ("scaffold complexity with simplicity" restated) prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with artist perceptual signature (noticing knots as math, grain as predictions). Prose texture distinct, rhythmic modulation in drone vs. wind. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("layered meanings," "timewoven alliances," "perpetually learning," "scaffold complexity") across beats create synonym churn, dulling density; e.g., repeated epiphany variants in paras 4-6 obscure propulsion. Figurative overload without payoff in peak assembly. Read-aloud rhythm varies but artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic slide teaching historical craft alliances transforms artist-in-storm trope via specific encodings (rope crest, barnacle map). Risky poetic voice heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable hindsight from archway shelter.</comment>
