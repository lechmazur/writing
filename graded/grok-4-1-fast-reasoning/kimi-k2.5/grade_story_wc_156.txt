<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (chemistry-obeying restorer vs. defying artist) build to earned change in painting moment; motivation rooted in curiosity exchange intensifies via nickel's heat. Minor over-articulation in "nested awakenings" realization risks epiphany feel but stays concrete. Final renunciation of certainty charged by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of awakenings tightens from wind chimes to echo-guided painting; closure as Charged Poise in nickel placement reconfigures perception with conceptual cost of dissolved certainty legible in "curiosity had colonized." Orientation anchored early; one deepening via spoken word suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains choices (parabolas redirect whispers, echoes map lines on wall), charges closure via air pressure shift; sensory hierarchy (acoustic over visual) reflects Elena's restored hearing. Recurring nickel as micro-setting evolves tactilely from pocket-warm to ear-pressed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via layered realizations narrowing perceptual options; agency in speaking word forces deepening with felt cost in hand-guided painting. One tightening reweights knowledge without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restoration as addition/growth emerges organically from echo-chords and nickel transformation; final image (nickel in crack, garden's breath) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like "acoustic graffiti" avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person perceptual signature biases toward sonic intimacy ("sound shattered against curved ceramic tiles"); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity without head-hopping or elision. Voice distinct via playful acoustic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in varying rhythms (short echo fragments vs. flowing realizations); purposeful metaphors cohere around reflection/rebirth without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in "nested awakenings"/"methodically playful" recur but pattern-taught and tied to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic garden and mural restoration yields inevitable CR (sound-grown murals); risk-taking in sonic womb/graffiti integrates organically, transforming tropes of epiphany into physics-driven process. Nickel offering heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
