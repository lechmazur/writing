<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in "serene anger" and decades-long search drives the disappearance, with embodied confirmation in "hands... with glacial slowness." Minor abstraction in epiphanies like "he understands" avoids full 9+ without more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ink patterns' breathing fractals building to Conceptual Repricing closure: tracker "becomes distributed through the moment" with legible cost in corporeal evaporation. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph's encampment post-eclipse; single scene tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sandstone constrains ink pooling and fractal mapping, charging closure's "dry sandstone"; wind "whisper[ing] secrets" and "howl[ing]... like a flute" mirrors erosion resisting entropy. Sensory hierarchy (pink eyes tracing horizon, drone's "tearing silk") reflects POV urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to grasp temporal dilation signaled early, escalates texturally via ink's "ephemeral patterns" confirming theory and narrowing to surrender; agency in uncorking/stepping yields disappearance cost. Entry to 8.8+ slightly missed as tightening feels more revelatory than trade-off forcing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of consciousness dilating time emerges organically from fractals and evaporation, resonating in final "spaces between spilled ink and evaporated moments" without overt moralizing. Closing line's drone and wind subtly reweight mercy for the attentive, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in wild observations like "shadows bleed back into light"; rhythmic prose modulates from serene to crystalline focus. Experimental lyric compression taught early via drone/ink pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density but overwriting artifacts: repeated "after the eclipse ends" (4x), "serene anger" (3x), "wind-carved encampment" (4x) create paraphrase loops dulling propulsion in final third. Metaphor coherence strong yet pervasive in peak beats ("warm taffy," "fractals that breathe") triggers −1.5 non-closure cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nomad ink fractals dissolving self into temporal mercy transforms time-dilation trope; risk-taking in evaporation closure feels inevitable from ink spill onward. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual commitment elevates.</comment>
