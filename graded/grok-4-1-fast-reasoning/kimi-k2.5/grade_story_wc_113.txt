<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in dreams and instincts compels concrete micro-choices like positioning lanterns and playing unwritten notes, earning her final act of leaving the program. Interiority particular through tactile tracing of fibers and instinctive string-plucking. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in climax slightly tempers score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to RR closure in water receding "through satisfaction" and program dissolving, with legible conceptual cost in collapsed in-between space. Orientation anchored early in pit descent. Lens holds cleanly without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Flooded pit constrains choices via lantern angles creating shadow puppets and water pulsing in vibration. Sensory hierarchy musical (ripples matching spirals). Final receding tide charges image, mirroring internal resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to voice ghost's melody escalates texturally as stains resolve into code, ghost materializes, deepening to collaborative play narrowing stasis loop. Agency in bow draw forecloses unresolution with water's visible recession as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mortality-spanning dialogue emerges via particulars like bleeding images creating instructions, resonant in final hush of "completed ones" reweighting decay as conversation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature (liquid harmonies, unstruck chords) modulates rhythmically under rising density. Stable close third-person limited, no leakage; compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere; rhythm varies with scene pulse. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "wordless conversation conducted through the medium of organic decay" risks coherence in opening but purposeful for texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost code via water-damaged hieroglyphs transforms haunted theater trope through liquid cartography and cello resonance, inevitable in hindsight. Bold synthesis heightens stakes across mortality without gimmickry.</comment>
