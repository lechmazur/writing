<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's shift from arsonist to artist feels earned through embodied realizations like tracing gouges, compelling higher-stakes creations; internal conflict between violence and tenderness acts in scene. Minor slip: over-articulated epiphany ("her fires had been prayers") borders diagnostic without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of realizations and art trail builds to CR closure in final image of healed portrait and her retreat into shadows, with conceptual cost of obscurity legible ("stepped back into the shadows with tears"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via deciphering synergy suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices—embers for charcoal, ashes as galleries—and charges closure via archive entrance installation; vivid sensory bias (mineral regret, volcanic glass) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting like tapestry and scars evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through art trail narrowing to archive; agency in creations forecloses exploitation path with cost felt in final tears and shadow-step. One deepening via deciphering synergy suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of destruction-as-preservation emerges organically from burning to trail, resonant CR in final image reweighting violence as prayer without moralizing; counter-reading (greed vs. listening) lingers via scarred portrait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (volcanic tenderness as bias); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, e.g., shortening in creation beats; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload ("volcanic tenderness" thrice) risks coherence in peak realization beat without full pattern payoff; minor paraphrase loops like burning/prayers/awakening deduct lightly as non-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist redeemer via scarred art trail to lost civ promise transforms tropes; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via negative space code.</comment>
