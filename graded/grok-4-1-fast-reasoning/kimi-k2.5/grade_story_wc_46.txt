<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene as memories' heat tempers polishing focus; final completeness earned by causal arc from guilt to liberation, with embodied cost in "old hunger for flame subside."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as polishing density builds to pearl's RR (Charged Poise), reconfiguring fire-transgression cost into enduring stasis; legible before/after in grotto's illumination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto fissures and mist constrain angle calculations and light capture, charging final pearl image; sensory integration (weeping walls, curling mist) mirrors internal humility without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (light without fire) deepens accumulatively via memory-tempered arrangement, narrowing to renunciation with patience-cost legibility; agency in final shard placement forces trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pearl's formation offers resonant non-literal answer to light-sharing premise, reweighting destructive fire via prism humility without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in celestial-gem metaphors ("zephyr bloom," "sea glass testament") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from meditative to luminous without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; minor figurative density ("mineral tears," "serpentine passages whispering") in opening lacks pattern-teaching but doesn't obscure pearl image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fallen star as humble polisher transforms exile trope; sea glass-to-pearl arc risks lyric fantasy for tactile ingenuity, heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
