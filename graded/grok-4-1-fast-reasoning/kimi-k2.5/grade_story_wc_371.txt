<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as creeping normality noticer drives consistent micro-choices like guerrilla gardening, embodied in dirt-caked fingernails and coaxing soil; regulars subtly pressure without stealing focus. Internal conflict subtle in solitary persistence vs. communal reveal, earned in pudding-sharing beat. Minor label-speak ("heuristically gentle") slightly abstracts traits, but actions align without safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from noticing absence to gardening increments to shared harvest, tightening at frost-decision to uncloak. Orientation anchored early ("rusted gate where ivy had swallowed"). Closure as CR in final image of garden-tending practice with conceptual cost of "daily renewal"; persistent constraint of cracked soil shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Overgrown palace courtyard micro-setting constrains choices (cracked marble for wheat, pumpkin vines on walls) and charges closure image of "pumpkin vines grew thick against ancient walls." Sensory details selective (anise smell, frost-silvered vines) filtered through Mara's noticing bias. Evolving environment mirrors internal states purposefully, no white-room; spatial choreography coherent across gardening/sharing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim lost bakery/sacred ordinary) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via seasonal deepening to pudding-sharing reversal that narrows options to communal practice. Agency in "decided it was time to uncloak"; cost legible as "tenuous absolution" in knitter's tasting line. One meaningful tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption as "practice, as tenuous as...yeast" emerges organically from particulars (preserved loaf to pudding, guerrilla wheat); final image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting loss as resistible. Subtext in silence/chewing carries ambiguity without sermonizing; no Thematic Echo despite articulated lines like Mara's speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Mara with perceptual signature (noticing voids, coaxing earth); voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm at sharing ("They ate in silence"). Dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual ("This is tenuous absolution"); no head-hopping despite group scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "crumbling the hardened loaf into milk and eggs" advances plot/sensory/character); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("creeping normality noticer by inclination and necessity") but purposeful for voice, not obscuring closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to pudding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening in secret tea house transforms loss trope via specific palace decay and bread relic; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of ordinary sacred. Turn at uncloak feels inevitable from established noticing pattern; no derivative templates.</comment>
