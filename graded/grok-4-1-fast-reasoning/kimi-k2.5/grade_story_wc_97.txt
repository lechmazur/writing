<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied grief through "steely longing" and micro-choices like piano modification compel higher-stakes decoding; final peace earned via persistent arpeggio with visible endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure; station stabilization and clock chime mark reconfiguration with emotional cost in "persistence" against decay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Piano coils, film projector, and arbor cables constrain decoding choices; flickering compasses charge final "true north" image reconfiguring drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant refuge stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through film discovery narrowing options; desperate synchronization endurance bears precision cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grief-to-navigation theme emerges via repurposed film/memory; final rewinding for "other travelers" offers resonant reweighting of loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("sound dissolved into the cloud-mist"); rhythmic modulation heightens climax tension without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure; minor climax metaphor density ("sky bruised purple") coherent but borders overwriting without obscuring image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh film-Morse-piano synthesis transforms aerial decay premise; "copper coils" ingenuity grows organically from grief, heightening stakes inventively.</comment>
