<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—panic-broken lock now repaired as "first true sculpture"—earning final choice to enter tunnel with cost of abandoning surface; embodied emotion (weight on ribs) and mnemonic trait concretely motivate under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory/images builds to Charged Poise closure as Elara steps through tunnel, reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of "trading laughter of crowds for solemn music of stone" legible in final image; oriented early, no issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Violet crystals' spectrum reveals watermark, constraining repair choice; tactile use of charcoal dust and hairpins integrates setting into action, charging final singing crystals image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (uncork creativity) signaled early via child's question, tightens through mnemonic discovery → repair agency narrowing options to embrace depth; cost unmistakable in "leaving the broken lock... as marker of transition."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of deferred calling emerges organically from lock rectification as "welding fractured confidence"; final image non-literally answers by transforming sorrow to "dawn of authentic vision," reweighting surface/depth premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with artistic perceptual signature (crystals' "auroral sorrow"); rhythmic diction modulates from hush to "feverish precision," heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels; figurative density ("mathematical poetry," "songs of stone") coherent and purposeful in repair beat, though slightly overwrought, pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms trapped-artist trope via mnemonic lock repair uncovering singing crystals; non-obvious synthesis of memory/cave physics feels inevitable, bold risk in lyric depth-embrace heightens stakes.</comment>
