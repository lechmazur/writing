<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied numbness ("gloves made of stone") contradicts emerging tactile ache, driving micro-choices like placing hands on drum skin and touching needle; final heart-sync realization earned with tears as visible cost after drought-dry cheeks. Mathew's pressure via cryptic summons and demo forces relational crucible. Minor slip: occasional abstract diagnostic phrasing ("low frequencies of grief") but subordinated to sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orientation anchored by ~50 words (Elara in cavern, autumn); single scene builds density from muted entry to filament climax. CR closure on-page—"heart began to keep time... endings could precede beginnings"—reprices silence with undeniable emotional cost in tears post-funeral drought.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern's acoustics ("thick rock... tapestries that swallowed every sharp sound") constrain hearing to tactile pressure, drum skin enables key choice, broken needle charges final image as vibrations reach heart. Sensory hierarchy touch-dominant fits deaf POV; selective details (walnut-stained hands, hides like sleeping animals) mirror internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness post-deafness/grief) signaled early; textural escalation peaks in filament—"vibrating thread... urgency of a trapped bird"—agency via touching needle forecloses numbness with tears as felt price. One decisive deepening reweights options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (silence's texture/fullness) emerges from backward-song vibrations pooling emotion, final needle-touch image non-literally answers "hush mirrors itself into patterns that make the heart remember how to ache" without stating moral. Subtext in Mathew's lip-read lines layers anticipation's architecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tactile perceptual signature ("syllables of pressure"); voice rhythmic, modulating from numb ("emotional numbness") to charged ("heart began to keep time"). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("feel it backwards"), idiom matches (gravelly, childhood-known).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax (short punchy sensations amid long undulating images); no loops, but figurative density ("filament... thinner than spider silk... trapped bird") borders overwrite in climax without muddle. Read-aloud ear strong, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tactile reverse-audio reveals "architecture of anticipation" transforming deaf teacher's numbness; backward-ballad premise risks bold, heightens stakes via broken needle's impossible function, inevitable in hindsight without tropes.</comment>
