<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via contradictory impulses—winding thread to summon presence while documenting absence—earns final renunciation of cliff-edge grief with embodied cost in blood rush and trembling hand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from projection to flickering dissolution; CR closure reconfigures healing as self-cartography with legible cost in "lonesome splendor of survival"; orientation anchored immediately in garden post-ship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Autumn garden constrains via wind-disrupted projection and charges final image with skeletal arbor mirroring internal vacancy; sensory selectivity (salt-rot, mist breath) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart healing geography) tightens accumulatively as wind forces faster writing, narrowing to endurance with visible cost in dissolving presence; one deepening suffices, charging thread's final pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of explained absences emerges via thread/tapestry shift, offering resonant CR in final tether image without moralizing; reweights prior projection ritual organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in geographic metaphors (valleys of acceptance, coastlines of regret) modulates rhythm under stress; stable close-third POV with no leakage, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (crimson rush matching leaves) with propulsion; figurative consistency (cartography motif) coherent without muddle, varied syntax supports lyric cadence to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituary-for-living premise with projecting-presence method transforms loss trope; risk in sustained geographic conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in thread's reprise.</comment>
