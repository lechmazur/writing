<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (sorrow/delighting laugh amid darkness) act in scene; final talisman-holding renunciation of ash costs years' emptiness, earned by process. Interiority particular via itching fingers, rekindling spark. No unearned epiphanies; change scales to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from network-following to light-painting tightens to CR closure ("light still knew how to find her"), cost legible in "years of ash" vs. pocketed daydream. Orientation anchored early (Mara/orchard/daydream). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains: fog as infinite canvas/wall enables light-painting, trees collaborate via glow; charges final image (sun pierces fog to fresco). Sensory selective (silver/rain taste, hollow chime), POV-biased (artistic lens). Micro-setting (fresco, film) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early, textural deepening via film-exposure process narrows options (interruptions completed here), agency in trembling-hand painting forecloses "shuttered heart" with felt cost ("known too much darkness"). Climax images force stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (latent joy like undeveloped film, creation outlasts ruin) emerges via fog-gallery images shifting to final CR ("she remained sensitive"); resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing. Particulars (fresco fruit ripening) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct: perceptual signature (chromatic joy, chemical exposure) biased artistically; syntax/rhythm modulate (slow-breathing time to mirthful dance). POV stable single; purposeful compression taught early, legible at sun-beam closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short laugh sentence amid long sweeps); minor figurative density ("time folded like soft dough") coherent, pattern-taught in photo-alchemy motif, no muddle at peak (images "display themselves"). No loops; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mycorrhizal network + phosphorescent light-painting + fog-projection gallery transforms artist-redemption trope; risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes (dream logic enables impossible exhibition), inevitable in hindsight via film motif.</comment>
