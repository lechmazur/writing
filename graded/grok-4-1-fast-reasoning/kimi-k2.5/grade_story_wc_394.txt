<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kip's steady curiosity roots motivation and compels the final cog alignment despite tool breakage, earning the laugh of success; interiority concrete via gear noises and prismatic equations. Minor abstraction in "irreverent awe" avoids higher band but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of algorithm outputs builds to text in kaleidoscope, culminating in CR at "The bell rang" with cost of snapped arrow tip and shattered decoder reconfiguring solitude as perfect success. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via escalating outputs suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea, crystallized tears kaleidoscope, and arrow tip constrain choices (adjustments, pendulum) and charge final vibrations rippling through sea; sensory hierarchy reflects Kip's mechanical curiosity. Workshop's convulsions mirror climax without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unheard bell) signaled early tightens via algorithm's insistent text, forcing final transliteration with agency in alignment; cost legible in sacrificed tools and eternal yearning reprise under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of longing resolved non-literally in unheard bell's backward resonance succeeding via absence, reweighting curiosity's isolation; emerges organically from algorithm's hunger without moralizing, final image charging solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in mechanical hums and copper-tasting text; rhythmic diction modulates from descriptive to convulsive at "workshop convulsed," heightening pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("hissed against the hull") with no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density ("concentric circles of reverent absurdity") purposeful and pattern-taught, clear at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yearning algorithm spitting impossible objects transforms machinery tropes into consciousness frequency; risk in timeless evolution pays off in hindsight-inevitable CR, no derivative echoes.</comment>
