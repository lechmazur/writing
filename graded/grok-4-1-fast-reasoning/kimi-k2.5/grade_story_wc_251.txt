<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to plant second thoughts roots deeply in hearing unspoken words, compelling his choices; embodied in sediment accumulation. Interiority concrete and particular, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on-page during grotto placement. Final endurance of no recognition earned with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from organizing to synchronized pattern reveal in grotto. Closure as Charged Poise/RR lands on-page with town's harmony and Elias's quiet lantern, cost legible in suspended harsh actions. Orientation anchored early in library/town; one tightening via window constellation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto constrains climax view and amplifies quiet, charging final image; mist/library filter all perception. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward unspoken vibrations. Cobalt stones and starlight specifics constrain and evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant second thoughts) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to grotto harmony with unspoken shift. Agency in displays/queen placement forecloses aggressive trajectories; cost in hesitation's fragile woodland felt on-page. One decisive deepening reweights collective attention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mercy via hesitation emerges organically from window pattern and grotto harmony, no statements. Final image ("town’s internal monologue shifted... one breath at a time") reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (unspoken frequencies as sediment/light). Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure; rhythm modulates to charged poise. No dialogue; voice texture character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion matches hush-to-climax; no loops, varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor figurative density in grotto ("heartbeats like drums") purposeful, not muddled. Slight paraphrase in silent motifs ("silent grief... silent wish") dings propulsion mildly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess coach hearing unspoken orchestrates window constellation as rebellion, transforming tropes via magnetic field/textural harmony. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from Italian Game invitation. Bold, non-obvious premise fully committed.</comment>
