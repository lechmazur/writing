<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's pacifism and shadow work create contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning the final push with embodied cost via naming cruelty at the hatch. Lio's question forces micro-choice revealing vow's depth. Pacifism complicates without hedging; traits shown through actions like refusing AI.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sorting to stitching to pouring, culminating in Charged Poise as hatch opens with conceptual cost of forgiveness. Orientation anchored early in spaceship and post-birth void. No lens ambiguity; closure reconfigures options via mist corridor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recycled hull plates, ceiling pipes, and quilt constrain choices (oxygen waste from floating, welded hatch); body lightness charges final rise to hatch. Sensory hierarchy (hiss of recyclers, garden scent) reflects Mara's priorities. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension for rebirth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shadow work deepening and stitching reversal narrowing to vial pour. Agency in honest naming forecloses unworked path with legible emotional cost at climax. Pressure coheres under lens, reweighting pacifism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of compassion through shadow work emerges from stitching tears and naming flaws, resonant in silver threads stitching new sky without moralizing. Final image reweights premise of ended humanity via mist corridor. Complexity in pacifism's chain-ending lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (universe re-stitched, candle ghosts) biases toward archival/spiritual; rhythmic prose modulates with pressure. Stable single POV, no leakage; dialogue natural/subtextual (Lio's question evokes vow). Voice as character: ghostly resolve in syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "thread pulled from vacuum suit seals" advances craft/world). Rhythmic variety, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (mercury tears). Zero scaffold in peak stitching/climax beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi isolation, Buddhist compassion, and quilt-as-map transforms end-of-humanity trope; lightness trait risks bold physics payoff at hatch. Premise implications fully committed; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
