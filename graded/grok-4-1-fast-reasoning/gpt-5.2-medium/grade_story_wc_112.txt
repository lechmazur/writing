<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's practical motivation rooted in station integrity compels her preemptive rotor repair, earning the final reset choice with embodied tension between philosophy and responsibility; contradictory impulses act in her rooftop decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lever notch triggers glider sighs and hologram corridors vision ("nested corridors"), causally driving Mara's repair and joint reset closure as Conceptual Repricing with responsibility cost legible in "time resumed forward motion while keeping its sideways secrets."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Station's radiator grids and heated gloves constrain Mara's actions (tightens straps before lever), charging final image where "mechanic's warmth came from circuits, not sentiment"; xenobiology details like glider thoraxes integrate purposefully through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (station intact vs. sideways time theory) tightens via causal vision of cracked rotor, forcing Mara's agency in repair that forecloses panic-flight path with on-page cost to Sen's data pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time as responsible toolbox emerges organically from Mara's reinterpretation ("not a highway to prediction but a toolbox"), resonant in reset's non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (mechanic's ear for machines) with rhythmic control modulates from hush to hum; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("We need a mechanic who can listen to machines").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("levered the brass handle down a notch, and waited for something to break. Instead...") varies rhythm without loops or muddled metaphors; purposeful lyricism taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sideways-time xenobiology and mechanic's holographic repair transforms time-travel trope into toolbox ethic; risk-taking in "chosen past" beat inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
