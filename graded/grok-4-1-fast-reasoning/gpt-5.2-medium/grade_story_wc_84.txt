<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary embodied interiority via Mara's drone-tracking gaze and itch of missing pieces; perpetually surprised trait enables curious pulls amid pressure. Final alignment earned through micro-choices like fitting chips. Contradictory impulses act in scene: startled yet deliberate drone launch and crank-turning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of trails, notch, chips builds to CR closure where pulses organize tone with felt tuning cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Star-trail gap tightens to decisive passage reveal without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dome slit and dusk ink constrain drone launch and notch pull, charging final hum image. Recurrent brilliant dimness mirrors internal brightening. Sensory hierarchy (grooves like wind, dust/oil smell) reflects drone pilot's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode frequency) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven drone trails to chip alignment under Accumulative lens; crank-turning forecloses misfit path with embodied effort cost. One decisive deepening suffices, reweighting belonging as tuned pieces.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging-as-aligned fragments emerges implicitly from chip fitting and pulse organization, reweighting premise in final laugh/realization without moral. Subtext in shy comet tone and star scratches invites lingering ambiguity. Closing image answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Mara-limited POV with perceptual signature: surprises bloom sharp as frost. Poetic diction/rhythm modulates from quiet chain punctuation to humming pulses. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-pursuing (pilgrim's tired smile explanation advances stake).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stones began to drink the last light" sets tone/atmosphere/action); rhythmic variety propels from dusk leak to inner brightening. Zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (light as ink, trails as scratches/wheel).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech, type matrices, and sonic belonging defies tropes via observatory's star/sound hybrid logic. Risky lyric compression feels inevitable in hindsight; irreplaceable chip-to-READ pivot heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
