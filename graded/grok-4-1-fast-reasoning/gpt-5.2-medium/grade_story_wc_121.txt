<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene via fear-widened branching timelines confronting abandoned selves; final choice to press tablet and stay is earned by causal buildup of dropped memories, with embodied cost of rising "heavier than before."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fractured timelines builds to resonant reconfiguration when strands fold into chosen path; cost legible in "rose heavier," foreclosing drift with proof of exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct's wet glass tiles constrain choices by splitting timelines per step; recurring water bead mirrors internal pause, charging final ripple resumption and brighter-then-charcoal image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to conquer self-labyrinth signaled early, deepens accumulatively as procedural paths force facing younger self; agency in testing branches culminates in timeline choice with unmistakable heavier commitment cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of avoidance labyrinth emerges organically from timeline selves holding dropped memories; final image of folded strands and carried tablet reweights premise non-literally, embracing complexity of earned gravity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of suspended instants and branching tracks stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in "periodically eternal" loops without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery like "runes pressed deep like cuts that had healed"; varied rhythm, zero loops, purposeful lyric metaphors enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural-generation tablet fracturing self into timelines transforms introspection tropes; risk in internal mosaic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via rune rules.</comment>
