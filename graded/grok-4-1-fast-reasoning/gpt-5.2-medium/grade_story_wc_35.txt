<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of Safi's ability and internal conflict, with contradictory impulses (fear of contagion vs. drive to craft) peaking in the bare-fingertip touch on the resin jars. Final endurance of blended remorse as shared craft forecloses isolation with bodily cost. Voice-specific traits like tasting air anchor individuality without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup to Charged Poise closure in the broth-sharing scene, where processed remorse reconfigures options with felt bodily cost. Orientation anchored early in courtyard post-rain; sinkhole descent as one tightening shard. Cost legible in "carried that mixture in his body."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like "spiral of salt crystals" and "coral ribs arched into a banquet hall for ghosts" constrain choices (tidal pools guide descent) and charge final image of rain-washed courtyard. POV-filtered (tongue catches memories) and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Desert fortress evolves causally with rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (turn pain into craft) signaled early via commander's request; escalation via bare touch flooding images, narrowing to blending with own failures under Accumulative lens. Agency in unwrapping hands forces trade-off; cost in contagious weeping alters squad dynamics on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared containment emerges from tasting/blending particulars, culminating in broth's non-literal resonance: remorse "folded into his own, so their dreams stayed unspoken but less sharp." Avoids moralizing; complexity in brittle/sturdy coral image lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in taste-driven noticing ("tasting the air the way other people listened"); rhythmic control modulates from lyrical buildup to terse closure. Stable single POV with no leakage; purposeful compression in memory flood legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "jaw tighten with strangers' fear until he spat into sand"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherence ("sandpaper rough memories," "brittle yet sturdy as coral") taught early, propels without muddle in peak tasting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef and remorse-preserved pavilion transforms tropes into organic drive; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight in submersion turning contagion to craft; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
