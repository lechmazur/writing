<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority concretely embodies contradictory impulses (certifying wonder vs. unfettering voice) in the hush-clenching moment; Maera's confession forces Lio's micro-choice to ring bells, earning final endurance as bell ringer with fragile decree cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chisel strikes to hush prison, pattern break via bells releases harmonics; closure as Conceptual Repricing (hush into shelter/permission) lands on-page with fragile decree cost in Council scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern's echoing ceiling and aurora constrain choices (ribbons thread overhead, dictating bell sequence); recurring prism bells as micro-setting charge final image of ringing lullaby/warning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder vs. rationing) signaled early, tightens via hush clenching Maera's voice; Lio's agency (bell sequence mapped to aurora) drives deepening under Textural lens, with fragile charter as legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's essentiality emerges via hush-to-choir shift, reweighted in amber sheet's final pattern (silence as shelter); Council weeping offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature (tasting copper sunrise, violets ringing) biases noticing and modulates rhythm under stress; stable first-person POV with purposeful compression pays off in throat-remembered aurora play.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("pale aurora thread through the ice ceiling"); figurative language pattern-taught via synesthesia avoids muddle, with varied rhythm charging peak hush release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, sculpted hush, and amber relic transforms silence trope into permission/shelter; risk of poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in Council testimony.</comment>
