<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leander's silence and intuition form a consistent hierarchy of values, with the abdication choice earned through causal discoveries tying personal restitution to dynasty's end. Contradictory impulses in scholarly hunger vs. mourning subtly act in his non-speaking reactions. Final micro-choice to return the crank reveals character limits without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: crank to panel click, hiss to standing waves pattern, ledger to Queen's voice confession, culminating in on-page abdication with dynasty-ending cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Leander in sepia room, evening). No unkept setups; closure's Decisive Change reconfigures stakes legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sepia reading room's dust ripples and arches as "instruments" constrain discovery via sound mapping to the hollowed book. Sensory hierarchy (hiss to chord, golden shadows) reflects Leander's intuitive perception. Recurring crank/object charges final balcony presentation and return, mirroring internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover betrayal proof for abdication) signaled early, tightens causally through gramophone revelations narrowing options to restitution. Protagonist agency in intuitive adjustments forces deepening knowledge with visible cost (dynasty closure). Queen's voice names specifics, charging peak with moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Betrayal-to-restitution theme emerges organically from stolen bridge plans to treasury redirect, with final crank return reweighting "build what we denied" without moralizing. Bridge motif shifts from intuition to literal restitution, inviting ambiguity on clean ending. Resonance in "silence finally filled with truth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of intuitive bridges and silent observation; diction/rhythm lyrical yet precise, modulating with pressure (hiss to confession). No head-hopping; voice distinct in "eloquently silent gaze." Minimal dialogue fits silent focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "dust trembled... mapped invisible pressure lines"); varied rhythm accelerates from musing to balcony. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; purposeful overwriting in sound images serves accumulative texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gramophone-room-as-instrument puzzle ingeniously synthesizes intuition/bridge tropes into causal discovery chain, transforming dynasty rumor into tangible restitution. Risky silence-as-eloquence heightens stakes; final return marks fresh "next builder" inflection without gimmickry.</comment>
