<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (arrow tip warming, heartbeats layering), with contradictory impulses (dismisses superstition yet tests shard) earning final renunciation of singular source. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values (prizes shard over skiff descent). Final pressing of tip forecloses miracle hunt with felt acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in stone tree revelation, reweighting premise with chorus-of-choices cost legible in "pressed it into the stone tree beside the others." Orientation anchored early (Pomona Drift, inversion flights). Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating arches and irrigation ribbons constrain navigation ("navigated by water flow"), charging final ringed canyon image. Sensory hierarchy pilot-specific (water over horizon, echoes as maps). Whirling silence evolves, mirroring internal tightening to heartbeat layers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience source) signaled early, accumulative deepening via shard test to canyon echoes narrows to acceptance, with agency in descent/pressing foreclosing hidden-miracle path. Cost felt in realization no single source exists. Coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (arrow tips as metal seeds from pilots' choices), final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting resilience as "chorus of choices" without moralizing. Subtext in echoes showing drought history avoids tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (trees as "pale fingers," water threads), rhythmic modulation under inversion stress. Lyrical diction consistent, eliding standard nav for voice-motivated compression that pays off in echo-maps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "irrigation ribbons unspooled upward" advances setting/action/atmosphere), varied rhythm breathes with scene (short inversion beats, expansive echoes). No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (roots fingers, time hurried), propelling to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity-inverting orchards with healing arrow-tips-from-weapons transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric world logic (echo guidance) inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via inversion timer without gimmick.</comment>
