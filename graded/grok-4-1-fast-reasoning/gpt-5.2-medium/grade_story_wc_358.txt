<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to cultivate foresight drives concrete micro-choices like using the patch as a flag and shifting containers, embodied in warming patch and delayed footsteps; final renunciation of symmetry forecloses passive investigation with felt time-cost. Contradictory competence-struggle peaks in sprint amid thinning hearing. No stock phrasing or tidy epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: data density spirals to convergence discovery, closure as Resonant Reconfiguration when asymmetry breaks silence with on-page cost (forklift cough limits minutes). Orientation anchored early (investigator, container yard, post-hush). No lens ambiguity or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Containers as resonators constrain choices, mirroring internal haze-measuring; patch/object charges final flutter guiding last door. Sensory hierarchy (air liquid, twitchy threads) reflects professional bias. Spatial choreography coherent through lanes to Dock Twelve cylinder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tightening spiral narrowing to center intrusion; protagonist agency disrupts boundaries, forcing trade-off with crew-return pressure legible in "minutes before... spun up again." One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of foresight-as-mapping emerges from haze strokes to final image reweighting premise without moralizing: "measuring the haze until it becomes a map." Particulars (patch, wind data) shift meaning organically; ambiguity lingers in operation's remnants.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "hazy strokes" and biased noticing (turbine points); rhythmic compression modulates with pressure (short sentences in sprint). Stable first-person POV, no leakage; voice as character in professional precision under thinning hearing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "patch warmed... turbine pointed"); varied rhythm accelerates in climax sprint, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (ocean pushing breath, air cancels sound); zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wind-machine premise from containers transforms silence trope via physics convergence; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight (patch circuits ree container hideaway. Bold risk in acoustic lens heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
