<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in the surge of impatience against her vow at the viaduct ("for a moment her impatience surged, urging her to sabotage it at once"), compelling the pivot to patient charting that earns the final patience; flaws drive struggle without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early moon-path mapping through layered observations to closure's Resonant Reconfiguration (viaduct "intact but useless"), with conceptual cost in "simple absence of obedience"; persistent moon constraint shapes tactics to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt, coils, and frozen lake constrain choices (sanctuary's iron dulls coils at third moon) and charge the final image; sensory selection (boots squeaking, lake groan, humming purr) mirrors internal tides purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient revolution tightens via deepening observations that narrow options to moon-timed unyoking; agency in signaling the move forces trade-off, with cost legible in restrained wildness and foreclosed impulsive paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting patience emerges organically from moon-like movement vs. empire's straight lines, reweighted in final image of "new horizon, patient at last" without moralizing; ambiguity in revolution's gentleness lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in horizon details ("moon paths across the ribs of cloud"); rhythmic modulation builds from purposeful climbs to charged purr at climax, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and reflection without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from dawn arcs to "humming dropped to a purr," clear under read-aloud test, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar patience vs. magnetic yoking transforms revolution trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via basalt-moon seam.</comment>
