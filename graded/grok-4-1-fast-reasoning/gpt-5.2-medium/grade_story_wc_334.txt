<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chronically curious folklorist shown through diving, touching silted branches, and breaking counting habit; contradictory impulses peak in "reaching in, plucking... without counting," earning memory recovery with cost of decades' blankness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising discoveries (notebook, constellations, spiral); on-page RR closure at "blankness folded back as if... stolen quilt," reconfiguring shipwrecks from graves to guardians with felt cost of lost time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse with algae-filmed panes, silted branches, and mushroom ring constrain choices; broken constellations on roof charge final spiral pattern discovery, mirroring internal recovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recovery stake signaled early tightens accumulatively to constellation spiral narrowing to ring; agency peaks in plucking/eating mushroom, foreclosing habitual caution with legible cost in sharpened nostalgia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Habits breaking enables return emerges via notebook page and final tending; resonant non-literal answer in "watch the broken constellations slowly be repainted by her own hand," reweighting theft as room for restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with folklorist perceptual signature ("detecting folklore in everything," "tasted rust and old apples"); rhythmic control modulates from descent tension to crisp release without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures ("memories stolen... blankness folded back as if... quilt"); varied rhythm propels from dive to closure, no loops or scaffolds dulling peak "plucking... tongue" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned orchard, fairy Court via constellations/mushrooms, habits as latch; risk-taking in textured recovery transforms folklore trope, inevitable in hindsight at repainting image.</comment>
