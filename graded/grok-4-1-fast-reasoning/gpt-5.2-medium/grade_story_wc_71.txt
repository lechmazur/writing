<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through embodied hush ("a shard of hush slid into her palm, a compact quiet that burned gently") and micro-choices like testing the clock, earning final realization; flaws like being teased balance competence without hedging. Contradictory impulses surface in wondering if aliveness is "magic but attention," compelling higher-stakes restorations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from shard discovery to nightly restorations and storm gathering; CR closure lands cleanly in shard release on tide line, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of "every misplaced object is a missing word." Orientation anchored early in boardwalk/bay; one tightening via clock test drains warmth, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orris shard as micro-setting constrains choices (heavier near lost drawers) and charges final image (saltwater sanctification spreads hush). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: hush sharpens gulls/pulse; bay evolves from daydreaming streetlights to storm-lit gathering, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore house aliveness via attention) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through failed clock move (warmth drains) forcing tactic shift to shard-guided placements; cost legible in stolen aliveness and final shard forfeiture. Agency via endurance in nightly visits tightens to storm crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of belonging via object conversations emerges organically from particulars like teaspoon-to-saucer matches; final CR image ("hush...loosened, spreading like cool fragrance") non-literally answers house-aliveness question, reweighting without moralizing. Profound line ("A house lives when it can recognize itself") earned by prior restorations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing ("streetlights daydream," "floorboards softened underfoot"); rhythmic control modulates from hushed discovery to flare at matches. Voice texture particular: syntax echoes scent-trapping ("trapping quiet itself").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("hush in her pocket flared whenever she matched a teaspoon"); figurative pattern (hush/blaze/scent) taught early, coherent without muddle in peak storm beat. No loops; varied rhythm supports textural lens, opening/final lines recharge motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perfumer's shard trapping "hush" as aliveness-compass transforms mundane estate work into hushed ontology; risk in lyric object-agency ("tables...thinking") heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from orris intro to tide release.</comment>
