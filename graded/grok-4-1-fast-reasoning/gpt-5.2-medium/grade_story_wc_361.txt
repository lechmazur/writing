<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rook's jitteriness embodied in shaking hands and clinging fingers at handover compels higher-stakes realization; contradictory ache for Nera drives earned planting choice with visible cost in non-ownership.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pendant vibrations building to CR closure in Nera's vision and chalk question; orientation anchored early in ridgeway dawn; conceptual cost undeniable in memory-to-myth fade.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora-lit scree and cairns constrain narrow path and charge final cairn planting; sensory details like buzzing felt filtered through Rook's relic bias mirror internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of meaningful delivery tightens accumulatively at pendant's mountain sympathy, narrowing to non-ownership renunciation; agency in chalk question forecloses possession with felt ache costing direct closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of germinating wonder emerges from vibration particulars reweighted in stitched memories; final cairn question offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in sympathetic buzzes and aurora lean sustains biased noticing; sparse dialogue natural with subtext in Mara's surprise; rhythmic control heightens closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, motif, and reflection without loops or muddled metaphors; coherent vehicles like "thaw finds a crack" propel to vibrating closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic vibrations transforming delivery into mythic seeding; bold accumulative fade risks poignancy, heightening stakes in routine wonder without gimmickry.</comment>
