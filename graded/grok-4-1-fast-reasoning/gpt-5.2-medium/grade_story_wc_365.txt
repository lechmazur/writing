<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory-specific interiority peaks in "presses on the ribs until breathing becomes a decision," embodying withheld truth's cost; micro-choices like spreading kit and weaving Jalen reveal values hierarchy. Final amendment earned by causal buildup. Minor diagnostic edge to Jalen's speech slightly tempers peak authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mosaic shards taught early via seam-opening; Accumulative/Textural lens (density of senses to pattern break) holds to CR closure in log entry, with cost legible: "lift from my ribs even as its full weight settled." Orientation anchored in first line; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Repair bay constrains via "broken conduits... hummed with choices"; shard as micro-setting redirects seams, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (taste static, palms grit) reflects POV profession without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) signaled early, tightens via beacon/Jalen confrontation forcing weave-agency; cost unmistakable in rib-lift/settle reconfiguration under Accumulative lens. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to amendment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weight motif emerges organically from particulars (shard heat, lie's mass), reweighting premise in final log without moralizing; resonant CR answers "weight of a withheld truth" via shared burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory braille ("palms already reading the grit"); first-person stable, rhythmic modulation under stress (short shards). Jalen dialogue subtextual, advances via accusation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels (chalk/microphone kit integrates action); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops. Slight figurative density ("tiny, dangerous sail") in opening risks overwrite but patterns to seam payoff without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping + parallel weaving transforms multiverse trope; risk of mosaic shards heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via cyclic pulse constraint.</comment>
