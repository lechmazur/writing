<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Logically emotional trait drives concrete micro-choices like fork-strike adjustment amid thief lunge, earning sonic absolution without harm; contradictory impulses (calculate grief yet adapt rhythm) act simultaneously. Trader confession reveals relational crucible under pressure. Final key-return renunciation forecloses theft path with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations accumulate from dock groan to shared hum RR (Charged Poise), reconfiguring thief cravings with conceptual forgiveness cost legible in "confession seemed to drain into the sound." Single scene anchors early; one tightening via matched pitch settles all into cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dock vibrations constrain choice, enabling fork-match tactic that charges closure hum; sensory hierarchy (ice sugar crunch, metal-apple air) filters via Lio's listening bias. Micro-setting (piling palm-press) mirrors internal resonance without overt symbolism. Final beam "pale blessing" evolves causally with light fall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (protect relic) signaled early tightens via agency-driven deepening: lunge prompts vibrational match, narrowing options to non-violent absolution under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in trader's glassy eye water and chest-clutch confession draining into sound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sonic forgiveness emerges organically from relic guardianship and resonance events; final "shared hum, fleshly ethereal" reweights premise non-literally, charging ambiguity of sacred sound vs. measured grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (grief-measuring, tide-calculation under gull-cries) biases noticing toward pitches/vibrations; voice rhythm modulates with intensity ("note rose thin and clean"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (trader whisper confesses via implication).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels: every line layers sensory advance (e.g., "planks shiver" integrates action/metaphor without muddle); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, overwriting purposeful in pattern-taught resonance vehicles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sonic absolution transforms guardian-thief trope via vibrational physics grounding emotional calculus; fresh synthesis (fork as maintenance tool absolves via dock-hum) risks poetic conceit, inevitable in hindsight at "bones gently corrected."</comment>
