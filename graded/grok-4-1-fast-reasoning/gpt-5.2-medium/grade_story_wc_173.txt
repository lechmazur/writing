<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's contradictory impulses—serene posture masking defiance—act simultaneously in the untangling beat, earning her final bow and walk with visible emotional cost from her sister's echo striking her ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to the seal's click and echo release, delivering Charged Poise closure where prisms empty into clear starlight with conceptual cost to conformity reweighted undeniably on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's "threads of light braided into a seal" constrains the unlock choice precisely; snow and starlight knives charge the final emptied image, with sensory selection (old breath, swirling syllables) perfectly urgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock defiance tightens via voices rising during untangling, forcing Maris's endurance under pressure; cost unmistakable in her near-stone freeze from sister's pledge before the final thread-pull.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of subtle defiance emerges organically from particulars like breath-as-key and scattered echoes; final image of "many melodies, some frightened, some free" resonantly reweights the lullaby without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bodily poem" phrasing and biased noticing (posture over words) persists under stress; rhythmic control heightens the release beat without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (threads, breath, knives) propels without loops or muddle; climax "swirling syllables, unowned" reads aloud with perfect cadence acceleration.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan defiance via breath-locked prisms and uniform-threads transforms tropes; "revolution, like untangled thread, must not snap" feels inevitable from established poetic logic.</comment>
