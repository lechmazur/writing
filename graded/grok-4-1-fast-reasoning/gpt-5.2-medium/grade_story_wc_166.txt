<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's dancer traits drive micro-choices like seated crescents syncing with tides, earning the vow-fulfilling tattoo; contradictory panic yielding to rhythm embodies internal conflict without labels. Keeper applies precise pressure via bargain. Final renunciation of speck's grief feels compelled by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anchoring to ink-dissolving spiral, culminating in RR (release after verse, heron-fledge reconfiguration) with legible cost (tattoo permanence, forsaken return). Orientation anchors by para 2. One tightening via bargain suffices; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's hedges/fountains constrain via rhythmic anchoring and brine-ink, mirroring dancer bias; star gaps charge verse and final dew-path step. Sensory hierarchy (brine whispers, wet-stone voice) selective, purposeful. Micro-setting (bench as fulcrum) elevates pivotal writing beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (indelible verse) tightens via anchoring bargain, forcing endurance trade-off that narrows to "staying pinned"; agency in seated dance and needle-pricks drives under lens. Cost unmistakable in shifted gravity and wrist-reaching line, charging onward network.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transmuted nostalgia emerges via speck-projection to faithful tides verse; heron wobble reweights elective exile as fledging network without moral. Subtext in gaps-between yields resonant CR, complicating censorship with blood-cost permanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (gaps in breaths/constellations) biases toward rhythms, stable close third; keeper dialogue subtextual ("city shard binds to grief"). Rhythm modulates tension, eliding no key facts; diction controlled, dancer-inflected.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels: "warmth crawled up her arm" embodies without loops; varied syntax/figuratives (trapped tide, obsidian grace) coherent, peak-clean. No scaffolds, paraphrase runs, or muddle; final "kept time behind her" recharges motifs propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ban-world, dancer-poet via gaps-method, speck-condensed nostalgia; risk of lyric compression pays in star-syllable verse, transforming exile trope into inscribed network. Heron's "unsure whether air would hold" inevitable hindsight turn.</comment>
