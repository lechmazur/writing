<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's mildly obsessed hunger drives concrete micro-choices like stealing the booklet and obeying Lyr despite wanting to snatch it back during the climax rain moment, earning the final internal shift with embodied cost. Lyr applies crucible pressure through teachings that force tactical changes. Contradictory impulses act in scene (external obsession vs. yielding to silence), satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from star dimming to storm peak and star's wink-out, with CR closure in "I traced the spiral... began my map... guided by what stayed unspoken," reweighting navigation via booklet's legible destruction as cost. Orientation anchors early in climb to fort. Lens holds cleanly to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridge fort's shell-shattered stones and sweating walls constrain via shuddering under storm, while pebble bowl on parapet enables wind-clatter readings that charge the spiral final image. Sensory hierarchy (hushes over visuals) reflects cartographer's bias. Environment shapes pivotal choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping endless night) signaled early tightens accumulatively via silence lessons and storm, with agency in retelling omissions foreclosing external tools as visible cost in ruined booklet. Escalation driven by deepening realizations under lens, cost unmistakable in non-panic tracing amid roar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of internal navigation via absences emerges organically from pebble clatters, dissolving gold, and omission-retelling, with final blank-booklet map as resonant non-literal answer reweighting stars' failure. Complexity lingers in migration metaphor without moralizing. 9+ test met via charged image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fixates on hushes/pauses (e.g., "hush between lightning strikes"), with rhythmic modulation tightening under storm pressure. Stable first-person POV biases toward silences; Lyr's dialogue subtextual and idiomatic. No head-hopping, elision purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., short storm-shudder sentences amid lush hushes), no loops or scaffolds; figurative language coherent and pattern-taught without muddling closure. Propulsion peaks in retell cadence. Zero artifacts in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle prophecy via pebble silences and gold-dissolve map transforms dimming-stars trope into inevitable internal-navigation CR. Bold lyric risks (mapping absences) heighten stakes organically. Non-obvious premise feels singular.</comment>
