<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the scanner-feeding decision, rooted in sisterly loyalty versus duty; final choice earned by prior risk-weighing with visible cryo-sealing cost. Interiority concrete and embodied in "hands shook" and memory-glance cue. Mara’s nod seals relational reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: letter realization → console feed → network pulse → Council arrival with reconfiguration. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise lands on-page in Censor's full-name "sentence" and reconnection order, cost felt in heart lurch and disgrace risk. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow-sealed library constrains choices via cryo isolation and dormant consoles post-Riots; frost-rimmed cabinets and nitrogen evoke tomb-to-forum shift. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (ink bloom, copper veins). Final hum recharges setting as forum under snow-muffle image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loyalty vs. truth-provocation) signaled early, tightens via console decision narrowing options to sabotage. Causal escalation forces stance crystallization in Mara's question; cost legible in personal sealing fear and career unmaking. Agency drives turn with on-page pulse consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of thawing contraband truths emerges implicitly from letter-feed to reconnection; final nod and humming archive offer non-literal reconfiguration of secrets-as-forum without moralizing. Subtext in unspoken glances and bait realization invites ambiguity on corruption pretense.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature via archival diction ("ink could bloom into rumor," "copper veins"); rhythm modulates from quiet breaths to flicker-hum crescendo. Stable distance; Mara's sparse lines carry subtext and advance via Censor question. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "warm as if it had crossed hands too fast to cool" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent and purposeful ("stirred pond," "buried bell") in peaks. Zero artifacts dulling closure hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cryo-archive premise transforms censorship trope via network sabotage and snow-muffle irony; fresh synthesis of bureaucratic stasis into scandal-forum feels inevitable from console risk. Bold poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
