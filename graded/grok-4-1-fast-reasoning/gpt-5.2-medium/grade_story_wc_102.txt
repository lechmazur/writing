<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "chest had felt like an unopened letter," revealing contradictory impulses of holding vs. releasing love; final renunciation of pride earned through ritual micro-choices. Flaws complicate without tidy resolution. Voice particular to artist's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from memory cue to breathing ritual, landing Charged Poise closure in "knot behind her sternum loosened," with cost legible in emptied lungs/pride. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early. No slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Viaduct's wisteria and fog constrain setup (camera on parapet) and charge closure (petals shake free sparks); body-as-microsetting (ribs corridor) mirrors internal release. Sensory hierarchy reflects spiritual urgency, no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("where is unused love stored") deepens accumulatively through pilgrim-guided breathing, narrowing to knot revelation and agency-driven exhale that forecloses withholding. Cost unmistakable in "lungs felt empty of pride." One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stored love as bodily current emerges via particulars like embers-to-face; final image ("current to join") reweights premise non-literally without moral. Resonance from struggle avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("lamps look like small moons") biases toward image/light motifs, stable close third; dialogue subtextual (pilgrim nods "as if fog were an altar cloth"). Rhythm modulates with breath intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density in lines like "breathe out until her lungs felt empty of pride" propels without loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (sparks/light) and vary rhythm. No figurative muddle dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pilgrim of sparks and tear-projected ribs synthesize regret/memory into fresh breathing ritual; risks lyric compression pay off in inevitable "soft flare" release, transforming tropes without gimmick.</comment>
