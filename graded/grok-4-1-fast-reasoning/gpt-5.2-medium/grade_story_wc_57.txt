<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's motivation rooted in seed-memory belief drives patient micro-choices like choosing black lotus and reverse-decoding overnight, earning his role as keeper with visible cost of openness. Interiority particular (rope as sentence), embodied calm under pressure. Final demo bowline reveals clerk's name, crystallizing change without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of decoding builds to Charged Poise closure where seed-in-crack knot marks living cycle, reweighting secrecy with conceptual cost of open teaching. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. No causality breaks; pattern taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snow-lit fulgurite shadows constrain knot-reading choice; fog rolls thicken then thin, mirroring tension to veil-lift at clerk's concession. Dock micro-setting tactile (planks, meltwater crack) charges final image. Sensory hierarchy philosophical: ropes as oceanic memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve methods vs. wire erasure) signaled early, tightens via weaver reveal and bowline demo narrowing options to open teaching. Protagonist agency in patient coaxing forces clerk crystallization under Accum lens. Cost legible: weavers drop secrecy shield.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-in-hands emerges from knot proofs (storms survived) and seed refusal, resonant in final cycle-binding without moralizing. Black lotus reprise reweights refusal as preservation strength. Complexity: secrecy as shield, not pride.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with Lio's perceptual signature (water thinking aloud, knots arguing order/drift); rhythm modulates from hush to veil-thinning cadence. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Mara bows, weaver studies satchel). No head-hopping; elision purposeful in fog-swallowed distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "fulgurite shard against dock lamp so its inner bubbles caught gold light" advances tool/atmosphere/action). Rhythms vary (short bell beats amid lyric swells); metaphors coherent (rope sentence, oceanic hush). Zero loops; closure image propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fulgurite-knot-seed decoder transforms preservation trope via lived harbor physics. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; bold knot-language world coheres without retreat. Final rope-as-library inflects non-obviously from particulars.</comment>
