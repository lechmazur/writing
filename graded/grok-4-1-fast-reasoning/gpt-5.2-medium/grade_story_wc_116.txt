<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied regenerative silence composting grief; loose grip on reality shown in unjudging witness of collapse ("Instead of mourning"), earning final teaching endurance. Minor abstraction in "therapy-speak" echoes like "self could be remade without applause or shame" slightly generic, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build of silence/images to CR closure: decay as script reconfigures witnessing stake, cost legible in unmourned collapse ("sunlight spilled on ruined atlases"). Mosaic shards (library-refuge-return-future) pattern-taught early by swan folds; orientation anchored immediately in catacombs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring swan/object constrains burrowing choices and charges final image in sunlight beam ("spores bloom on parchment"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (silence drinks sound, air repairs memories). Obsidian refuge's sound-drinking hollow mirrors internal regenerative calm, evolving with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness refuge's breath without judgment) tightens accumulatively: refuge silence forces realization ("workshop where the self could be remade"), agency in sitting/not-writing forecloses ownership path. Cost visible in heavy words falling "like ash"; single deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unjudging witness via decay-as-compost emerges organically from particulars (moss/loam, pages to soil); final image ("decay was also a script") non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral. Charged reprise of silence/river avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: decay as "usable soil," silence regenerative; rhythmic control modulates from "crumbling peace" to charged poise in refuge. Keeper dialogue sparse/natural, subtext-laden ("what I would record"); stable first-person POV, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax ("Moss stitched the shelves to the stone"); metaphors coherent/patterned (folds/compost). Zero loops/artifacts; final line image recharges motifs cleanly, read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: origami folds as catacomb-mirroring portal transforms hidden-library trope; risk-taking lyric mosaic heightens stakes of loose-reality witnessing. Irreplaceable swan mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
