<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in overriding instinct to unsnarl kelp and breathe hush despite air gauge; final choice to pour memories into mirror earned by prior vial-caused visions and mother's backstory anchor. Embodiment specific via stinging eyes and warming vial touching skin-memories. No safety-hedging flaws; fear tightens knot as character-specific blind spot compounding struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tether snap to vial drop blooming memories into hush reservoir, culminating in CR closure as signal pulses via shared recollection with air-cost legible in "gauge hit its last trembling bars." Single scene causality tight; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint of thinning rebreather shapes all tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Temple constrains choices via kelp-wire knot and muffling hush swallowing beacon; body as micro-setting via failing rebreather and glove-brushed vial charges final mirror pour. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to perfumer's scent-noticing amid narrowed crisis perception. Coral-furred pillars and silver beads evolve causally, mirroring internal hush-thinning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal survival amid air shortage) signaled early via sputtering beacon and shaky reports; accumulative escalation via hush-spill deepening to memory-reservoir realization forces vial-agency trade-off. Unsnarl reversal narrows flee-option with deepening knowledge/cost. Protagonist endurance forecloses instinct-path with on-page gauge bars and felt crew-ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ephemeral-harnessing theme emerges organically from vial-mixing hush into memory braid, reweighting premise via temple-as-reservoir without statement. Final mirror-pulse offers non-literal answer: shared recollection thins hush at personal cost, inviting ambiguity on remembrance-theft. Resonance from particulars like drowned-king relief and mother's petals avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature of scent-memory bias (vial "touched memories buried in her skin"); rhythmic control modulates from drifting entry to peak-stress compression in "stone slid aside without a sound." Stable single-POV distance; purposeful elision of crew paid off in poured-ache pulse. No withholding; inference matches diver-limits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: each line layers sensory/causal advance sans loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent (hush as "stored stillness... held like breath"). Rhythm varies read-aloud from long vaulted sentences to short-gauge crisis snaps. Zero figurative muddle in peak unsnarl/breathing beats; opening anchors stakes via "failing rebreather."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken-temple trope into hush-reservoir unlocked by perfume-memory alchemy feels inevitable via vial's teardrop evolution. Bold risk in accumulative CR closure heightens ephemeral stakes without gimmick. Non-obvious angle on salvage as remembrance-harness transforms genre conventions organically.</comment>
