<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vivid in reluctant nod despite resistance ("every part of her resists becoming anything else"), embodied via steady pulse amid loosening bones; final choice earned through grief's paradox, foreclosing human form with felt cost. Voice particular to beast whisperer. No label-speak flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from spices to metamorphosis; RR closure on-page as Mira sheds body ("lets it fall away like shed bark"), cost legible in geometry shift. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early (orchard post-phoenix). No ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard specifics constrain: star anise/cardamom supply conjuring method, oldest tree splits corridor; moonlight thickens/milk charges final image of hounds circling blossoms. Sensory hierarchy beast-focused (pawsteps, rustle), mirrors steady grief without overt symbols. POV bias sharpens micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled early, textural escalation via Sable's warning and spice flare narrows to metamorphosis trade-off; agency in nod/breathing forces change, cost unmistakable in body shed. Pressure coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening over commanding emerges from throat-whisper and final beast heartbeats woven; resonant CR in hounds' run reweights bond premise via shared equality, no moralizing. Particulars (cinnamon-mist skin, petal universes) drive without platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable single-POV, perceptual signature spice-scented/moonlit; rhythm modulates intensity (short breaths in conjuring). Rustle "dialogue" subtextual, advances via beast-language intimacy. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (bones into "new geometry," skin to "mist threaded with cinnamon"); varied rhythm propels, no loops/artifacts. Minor figurative density in peak (conjuring) coherent under textural lens, no muddle obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cookie fortune + spices conjure hound-metamorphosis in phoenix orchard transforms afterlife trope via cosmic listening; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in final corridor step.</comment>
