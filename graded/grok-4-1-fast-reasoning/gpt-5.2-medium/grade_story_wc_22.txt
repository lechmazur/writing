<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via father-taught languages and bird-sorted cries, with embodied doubt peaking in "whether my small fertilizing can count as peace," but lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the ritual climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to ritual assent, with Charged Poise closure in clacking stones and folding blossoms reconfiguring peace; cost legible in "vastness press close" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains digging/wading and charges final image of roots threading fragments; sensory hierarchy (gull cries over waves) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden as new concord) signaled early, tightens via gull-guided trench and pressure-to-assent shift driven by language ritual; cost felt in knee-deep wade and lingering doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile peace emerges organically from seed-silt mixing to "roots threading through bullet fragments without hatred"; resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Eel Speech and gull translations; rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual with clean first-person stability, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (jetty as beast throat) taught early; no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies to propel ritual without overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman-ritualist bargaining dead via birds/languages transforms war-reef tropes; risk in narrow-vast tone heightens stakes to inevitable garden-assent image.</comment>
