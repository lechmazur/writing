<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in micro-choices like tracing the arena while kettle murmurs, revealing contradictory grief (silence pacing like cat) and practicality; final endurance earned via carving's cost, confronting loss without tidy epiphany. Contradictory impulses act in scene (harvesting vs. rot), passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from first crystal channel to sealed panel, tightening via steam visions; Charged Poise closure in "lifted the ash wood into the light and saw the circle glow like an ember refusing to die," with legible cost of absence clarifying lessons. Orientation anchored early (widow in loft); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skylight rain beads and loft's wet metal/tea integrate tactilely, constraining carving (worktable under rust-hued light); recurring crystals/wood charge final image, mirroring internal states via POV (circus breath holds). Environment shapes tactics (kettle steam triggers visions), passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest lessons) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via three channels narrowing to "build hands that open"; agency in carving forecloses rotting grief with on-page cost (sealing absence). Escalation driven by protagonist under lens, cost unmistakable in glowing panel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (work grief into open-handed release) emerges from carving particulars, subtext in crystal visions; final tea-drinking image offers resonant answer reweighting "here and gone" without moral, passing 9+ test. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (practical sensory bias: "inventory sorrow the way she once counted meat cubes"); rhythmic control modulates (short carving beats under kettle pressure), distinct texture in lyric compression. No head-hopping or elision issues, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "steam thickened, and through crystallized time the blank held the sound"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figuratives cohere without muddle in peak (kettle whistle). Zero scaffold, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystallized time/perfumer crystals transforming circus grief into carved lessons; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes (time as splinters), inevitable in hindsight via "ember refusing to die." Bold, non-obvious premise passes 9+ test.</comment>
