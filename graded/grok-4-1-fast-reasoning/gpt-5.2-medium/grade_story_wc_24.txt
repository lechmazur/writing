<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivar's interiority shines in embodied actions like counting backwards to calm hands before probing ice, revealing contradictory impulses between duty and deeper inquiry into clocks' true measure. Final deliberate winding-off of mantle clock earns closure choice with visible cost against accuracy. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like peculiarity complicate inspector confrontation authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ice-lagged clock to fog-blurred sighting to inspector clash, culminating in Charged Poise CR where deliberate clock wrongness reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost of chosen inaccuracy. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. No causality breaks; micro-turn at probe allows payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice "blooming along the intake pipe like white moss" and fog tearing horizon constrain fixes and sightings tactilely, charging final reset image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: hydraulic ticks over sun rim. Fjord quiet evolves causally from whistle to softened inspector.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clock accuracy vs. true measurement—tightens accumulatively via ice narrowing flow and 47-second drift, forcing endurance of disagreement; inspector's demand crystallizes stance. Agency in probe and off-winding forecloses precision path with legible opportunity cost. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chosen meaning over ticked time emerges organically from clock drifts and deliberate wrongness, reweighting premise in final line's resonant reminder without moralizing. Mantle clock reprise shifts from talisman to symbol of human fear between ticks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in razor-edged horizon and pipe-shepherding diction; rhythm modulates from dripping thoughts to clipped zero-count. Stable single POV with no leakage; sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven in inspector softening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: "sun's first rim nicked that edge" layers image/action/character in propulsion. Varied rhythm avoids monotony; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak ice/probe beat. Clean grammar elevates ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hydraulic clock as pressure-measurer transforms timekeeping trope into fresh existential frame, with razor edges and backward-counting yielding inevitable CR. Bold poetic risks heighten stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
