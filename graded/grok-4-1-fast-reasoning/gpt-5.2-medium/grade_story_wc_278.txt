<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vivid in guilt dissonance versus meteor chase impulses, embodied in needle buzz as cry; micro-choices like tattooing comet tail compel tethering and apology with visible cost on wrist/skin. Final renunciation of guilt earned via prior causality. Dr. Sato applies immediate pressure via star-matched tattoos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sounds/stars/textures builds to closure's Charged Poise where cry softens into hush, tether slackens with felt emotional cost in "guilt finally muted." Orientation anchored early in studio/city; one tightening via lab activation suffices. Pattern taught without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory as cathedral of humming reels constrains climax—shelves sigh, ceiling opens like "night water"—charging final image; amber as micro-setting handled tactilely, cools at payoff. Sensory hierarchy (sounds over visuals) reflects Lio's bias; details selective via tattooist lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt via lost cry) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through letters/lab/fold to agency in tethering/apology; cost unmistakable in heartbeat-static realization and slackened tether foreclosing dissonance. Protagonist alteration drives resolution under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of abandoned sounds folding back emerges via particulars—cries as coordinates, firmware's infant recordings—reweighted in final hush without moral; resonant answer in "new constellation... guilt finally muted," inextricable from arc. Subtext in starlight tethering past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sound/star diction ("meteor hush," "needle buzz"); rhythmic control modulates to compression at fold ("shelves sighed... wail"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Dr. Sato's explanation advances stakes). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm (short sentences at peak: "Words scrolled... I am cold"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative pattern ("time folded... night water") pays off without muddle in closure beat. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooist guilt, sound-lab firmware translating cries via time-fold transforms supernatural tropes organically; risk in lyric texture heightens closure's hush without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from amber/letters/tether premise.</comment>
