<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—love and refusal—act simultaneously via tangent question and hidden jars, earning final trust-ripening choice with relational cost; Iven's embodied worry and softening reveal status shift under her observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cicada thickens time density, enabling foresight tightening that reconfigures harbor doom as passage; Charged Poise closure in warmed cicada and tide return lands with legible cost in "coral that cuts while it builds."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Trapped seawater pool and jade cicada constrain foresight choice during talk, mirroring internal stretch; starlight line and creeping tide evolve to charge final beach paradox image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cicada's tangential time-texture sense synthesizes tidal observation into fresh, inevitable passage reconfiguration; bold subtle magic risks pay off in charged closure.</comment>
