<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to salvage purity drives all choices with concrete interiority, like speaking reason "into her regulator and into her own ribs." Attribute "weaves truth carefully" constrains patient confirmation before accusation, earning the exposure. Final renunciation of Fen shows earned stasis with felt cost in ghost's gratitude; no unearned epiphanies or stock emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ghost images, dream cameos, and lens visions builds to CR closure where globe repurposes as "gentler window," reweighting purity with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (shrine, Mara, globe). One tightening via globe-lens alignment reveals Fen's method, narrowing to confrontation without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glacier shrine's ice lens constrains spying choice and charges final image as alcove window. Sensory details (cold blue flames, trapped voices as breath) filter through Mara's wreck-diver bias, evolving with action. Micro-setting of globe as pupil-like distortion mirrors internal priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose Fen via pure salvage) signaled early, escalates via dream analysis tightening options under textural lens to pier confrontation. Agency in aligning globe/lens forecloses accusation path with cost: Fen's capture alters harbor dynamics. Visible price in thinned spirits and Mara's patient risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rescued purity emerges from globe's evolution (wreck talisman to exposure tool to alcove window), reweighting exploitation without moralizing. Final snow image offers non-literal answer to connection's cost, inextricable from Mara's arc. Subtext in cameo drifts and dream-doors invites ambiguity on truth-weaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: biased noticing of distortions and ghost images as "pressed against her thoughts." Voice texture (lyric compression like "candles borrowed starlight") modulates rhythm under pressure, legible throughout. No head-hopping; inference matches wreck-diver knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "glass does not slump... unless someone has brought heat" advances plot/atmosphere). Rhythmic variety, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful (teardrop pupil) without muddle in peak lens beat. Clean syntax supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-harvester smuggler skimmed via underwater brazier transforms ghost tropes through diver's truth-weaving. Cameo tracking in dreams and globe-lens spying feel inevitable from particulars. Bold risk in glacier shrine as dream window heightens stakes organically.</comment>
