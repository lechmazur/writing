<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's traits as sculptor and learner drive concrete micro-choices like lighting the lantern and carving symbols, earning her shift to alliance-weaver. Interiority embodied in "half laughing, half terrified" moment. Minor abstraction in realizations slightly distances peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lantern bloom to cross-time dialogue, culminating in Charged Poise RR as gatherings align under shared light with pocketed slide's conceptual cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via sculptures suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archway and driftwood constrain choices (shelter for carving, materials for symbols) and charge final image of aligned crowds. Sensory hierarchy (turbine-hum, rust/kelp) reflects sculptor's bias. Weather pressures action throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost to sea wall savior) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through projections revealing wall failure. Agency in adding driftwood pieces narrows options with shared labor cost. Legible in sculptures' planting altering town path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust via simplicity emerges organically from spiral motif's shift across times, reweighting tribalism without statement. Final image of aligned gatherings offers non-literal resonance to alliance question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (sticks as symbols) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from storm urgency to poised closure. Projected voices carry subtext naturally. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel under pressure; purposeful metaphors like "timewoven alliances" taught early without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening tolerated as lens-serving pattern. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic lantern as time-thread with driftwood semiotics transforms lost-in-storm trope; risk in temporal mosaic heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight via sculptor's craft.</comment>
