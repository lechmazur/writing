<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and contradictory impulses (hoard vs. release) culminate in earned final choice to read aloud, with embodied cost in "oasis felt... tendable again." Tranquilly perceptive trait shown through micro-choices like gazing at ghosts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ghost density builds to box-opening RR closure with legible cost in Mara's nod and departing ghosts. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via Mara facing hives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hives, dry spring, and box constrain choices (carry to spring for release) and charge final image of tendable oasis. Sensory details (wax scent, ash on tongue) selective and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (untangle covenant) signaled early, tightens via clustering ghosts at box forcing release; agency in reading aloud forecloses hoarding with visible cost as ghosts depart. Escalation driven by accumulative density under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of releasing unspoken words emerges organically through box/papers; resonant CR in "I forgive you for surviving" reweights covenant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (reading ghosts via clues) and rhythmic control modulate with pressure; stable single POV, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "colors moved over their faces like slow speech") without muddle in peak release beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible ghosts, beekeeping oasis, and box of unspoken words transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes to charged closure.</comment>
