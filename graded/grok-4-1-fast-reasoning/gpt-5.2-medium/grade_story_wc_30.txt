<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via trembling hands amid titan-gear wading and furnace-building to combat repetition; final renunciation of past self earned by moon-erased memory with visible cost in "calm permission." Interiority concrete and particular, no epiphanies unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of rituals and contradictions builds to Charged Poise/CR in final image of shelves "learning to migrate," reconfiguring identity with conceptual cost of endless present. Orientation anchored early in atrium and gear; one tightening via smelting bookmarks narrows repetition stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains choices (gear-wading, creel-lowering, furnace placement); recurring creel and moon charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (salt-paper tension, tide murmur), integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. repetition) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through creel/smelt rituals forcing acceptance trade-offs; cost legible in fluctuating memories and "no sudden revelation." Agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses tidy identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-through-contradictions emerges organically from creel-caught promises and shelved stories; final image offers non-literal answer ("routine made newly strange") reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with perceptual signature (tide as "patient lecturer," moon as "clipped coin"); Captain dialogue natural/subtextual. Stable distance modulates rhythmically under reflective pressure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy sentences amid flow); purposeful metaphors coherent and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting dulls closure image of wavering shelves.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library, moon-memory flux, smelted bookmarks transforms identity tropes; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in surreal endless-today, inevitable in hindsight via creel reprise.</comment>
