<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between truth compulsion and safety needs act vividly in the patrol confrontation, earning the burial choice with relational cost to openness. Interiority particular via embodied truths like "my mouth started to tell her everything."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to CR closure: burial reconfigures honesty with secrecy's conceptual cost, legible in "psychological safety sometimes requires secrecy." Orientation anchored early; pattern taught without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains choices (storm snaps platform, ravine hides eye) and charges final image under truffle bed. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: truffle roots over sway prioritize foraging bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant safety stake tightens accumulatively via eye testing to patrol evasion, narrowing to burial with agency-driven trade-off. Cost unmistakable in forgoing open relic use for secrecy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of burial non-literally answers truth-vs-safety question, reweighting "fractured grace" from eye aid to chosen secrecy without moralizing. Emerges organically from particulars like shrapnel-truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("read the ground like a ledger") and rhythmic modulation under stress; brief dialogue natural/subtextual (Lio's lie flinch). Stable first-person with voice-motivated compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; rhythm varies purposefully without loops or artifacts, even in peak patrol beat. Figurative coherence (truth as "shrapnel") supports without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-empathy virus world with glass-eye relic transforms relic tropes via truth-safety calculus; risk in "fractured grace" tone heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
