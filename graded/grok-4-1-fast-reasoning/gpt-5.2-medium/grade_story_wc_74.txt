<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's methodically hopeful trait drives concrete micro-choices like painting panes and proposing the experiment, earning her shift to trust; Ro applies pressure via memory recognition. Interiority particular through daydream scripts; embodied hope in insomnia endurance. Minor abstraction in emotions ("daydreams sparked") slightly genericizes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of painted words and proofs builds to RR closure in final image of gifts as proof and "rouse," reweighting isolation with communal cost felt in Mira's approaching sleep. Orientation anchored early (rooftop greenhouse, smog city). Persistent constraint (moonlight) shapes tactics; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices (panes for visible scripts) and charges closure (glow draws offerings); smog contrasts hope, saffron/citrus sensory filter via Mira's priorities. Details evolve (writing visible from street); spatial choreography clear. Body/tool (brush on glass) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove kindness endures for survival) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Ro's recognition and experiment, narrowing isolation with deepening proofs. Agency in Mira's invitation/proposal forecloses doubt; cost legible in prior insomnia and city cynicism reconfigured at communal response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of enduring kindness emerges organically from jam->brush->scripts->offerings chain, final "rouse" reweights premise without statement. Subtext in Ro's "chest hurt" implies buried memory; complexity in city's grind vs. quiet proofs lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Mira's perceptual signature (moonbeams as doors, drifting seeds); voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm with pressure (short sentences at Ro's whisper). Dialogue subtextual/natural ("marks made my chest hurt"); no head-hopping, elisions pay off in reveals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "knock came... thin as a question"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language consistent/voice-driven (light "open[ing] a door"); minor density in metaphors during buildup but no muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian smog, lost kindness-languages via moon-brush paints transformative trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "rouse" repricing. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
