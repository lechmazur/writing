<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to feel time's texture drives embodied choices like pocketing the urn shard and trading it; contradictory impulses (servicing others vs. seeking personal understanding) act in scene, earning timeless duty with felt loss of borrowed year.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from tag patterns to silo's sequences, with CR closure in Eli's unmoored state and new tag; cost legible in "borrowed year slip off him like a coat," reweighting premise without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald silo's green light, iron-rain air, and vents constrain path via remembered door and seam trade; recurring green charges final waiting image, mirroring timeless pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to grasp time's texture tightens accumulatively via message pattern and urn trade, forcing agency in seam placement; cost unmistakable as pulse countdown vanishes, reweighting duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as transitions emerges from tag rhythms and ash ballast, with final tag-writing offering resonant answer to texture quest; reweights grief and wind without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from garage sprawl to green stillness; minor figurative density in opening doesn't obscure, no loops touch closure seam moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of numeral shift and ash-powered capsule transforms time tropes; risk in textural lens heightens stakes, with tag cycle inevitable from particulars.</comment>
