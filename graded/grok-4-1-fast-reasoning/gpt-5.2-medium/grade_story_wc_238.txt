<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marin's dual role as columnist/exorcist yields concrete interiority and contradictory impulses acting in the ritual beat, where she whispers metaphors but delivers the plain apology; final renunciation of past sharpness earned via memory pull, with embodied cost in shaking hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (ozone, pears) and ritual beats build to RR closure in the bottle's crack and warm breath; cost legible in "imperfect miracle" line as fuse pops and scent leaks like a tear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (smell as ghost map, pear/smoke) filters through Marin's bias, with shelves' wiring and perfume constraining ritual choices; recurring bottle/catalog charge final image of leaking scent onto notes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology amid orchard doom) signaled early, deepens via chord's memory pull narrowing options; agency in activating breaker forces trade-off, cost felt in surge and imperfect response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (rumor as nail, grief as river) emerge organically to reweight redemption's limits, answered non-literally in correction-writing amid revving saws; no moralizing, complexity in partial forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in metaphor-drenched noticing (dust like pollen); rhythm modulates from poetic setup to terse climax ("I am sorry"), heightening pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with coherent metaphors (nail/claw-wood bruise) integrated into action; no loops or scaffolds, rhythm propels via varying lengths to charged end ("gritty with sweat and holy smoke"). Minor figurative density purposeful under lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist premise transformed via wiring ritual and pear-smoke ghost; risk in "shopwork miracles" yields fresh synthesis, inevitable in hindsight as bottle crack recharges orchard motif.</comment>
