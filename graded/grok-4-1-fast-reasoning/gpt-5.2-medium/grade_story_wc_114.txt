<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied guilt ("weight lodged behind my tongue") and contradictory impulses (lie to soften weather backfires); confession earned via Mara's pressure with relational cost of loneliness. Mara's oracle traits force micro-choices revealing narrator's flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of weather metaphors builds to RR closure in confession ("told him...as a weather report that included my own distortion"), cost legible in "loneliness it had created." One tightening via smudging notebook; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Station tools (anemometer, barometer) and botanical illustration constrain choices (petal-pointing diagnosis) and charge closure image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (aurora ripples ask for truth's weight); weather mirrors internal sway without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swallowed truth's weight) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Mara's interventions narrowing certainties to confession; agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses hiding lie with on-page relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truths as shifting pressure systems emerges via particulars (smudged notebook, alternate sentences); final aurora image reweights certainties non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in weather-inflected diction ("truths behave like pressure systems"); stable first-person with rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure; dialogue subtextual and advancing ("what truth I had swallowed").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (aurora, pressure systems), though minor density in opening simile string slightly slows propulsion before fever anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather station as emotional oracle crucible; swaying certainties transform guilt trope via specific meteorological idiom, risking poetic density that heightens closure stakes.</comment>
