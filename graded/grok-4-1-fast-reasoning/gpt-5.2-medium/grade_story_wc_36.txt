<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driven relic keeper shows contradictory impulses acting in scene—fear vs. understanding in shaky fingers steadying before uncasing—and final realization earned by prior micro-choices like driftwood apology. Interiority concrete and embodied; pilgrim's question forces relational crucible. Minor reflection anchors to present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory hush and markers builds to on-page Conceptual Repricing where final hush reconfigures guardianship as wayfinding with conceptual cost of prior deafness. Orientation anchored early; single-shard structure with legible otherworld transition fits scope; closure cost legible in "answer she could finally carry."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood and boulder throat constrain choices (markers point gap) and charge final image (arrows still wait). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hush as listening surfaces); Thunder-echo subtly mirrors internal shift from failure to insight. No white-room; tactile navigation coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest insights from failure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via flute-playing deepening knowledge of fear's cost. Agency in uncasing/playing forecloses rule-bound path; pilgrim encounter crystallizes stance. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral price before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (guardianship as wayfinding, not wall) emerges organically from particulars like outward vs. inward markers; final image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting fear as deafness. Subtext in pilgrim's "trusted rules more than a living voice" earned, no moralizing. Complexity lingers in accepted flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (hush as engineered, rock as listening); diction/rhythm modulate from heavy quiet to iron-rain shift. Pilgrim dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, elision purposeful for Accumulative lens payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-job (e.g., "inhaled. The first tone... canyon received like water into sand" advances sensory/atmosphere/action). Varied rhythm, no loops; minor figurative density in peak playing beat coherent and pattern-taught. Clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic fantasy with textural hush/flute-weaving transforms portal trope into introspective wayfinding; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes via quiet pressure. Driftwood spiral realization inevitable from prior particulars; no derivative hedging.</comment>
