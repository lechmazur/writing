<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's progression from obedient copyist to defiant planner feels earned through consistent traits like careful notation applied to lyrics and cloaking, with embodied prick of emptiness driving micro-choices. Vell as secondary adds pressure without overshadowing. Minor slip: final understanding ("her work was no longer only ink and obedience") borders unearned epiphany at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of luminosity and dust builds to CR closure where dust whispers halt Censors, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of reclaimed stories. Orientation anchored early in archive loft. Shards (alcove, home, concert) transition legibly with pattern taught by glow motif; one tightening via concert plan suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (soot like snow, dial glow warming fog, dust shimmering at boots) filter through Mara's copyist bias and constrain choices, like alcove secrecy enabling recruitment. Final image of mist holding seeds as seeds charges closure. Micro-setting of radio and cloth evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore stories vs. Censors) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sparkle detection → cloaking → public concert risking open defiance. Protagonist agency in radio placement forces crystallization; cost legible as Censors' advance countered by dust's whisper, foreclosing suppression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of indelible stories emerges organically from copying lyrics into dust/music, culminating in non-literal CR where "mist held the stories like seeds" reweights famine premise without moralizing. Subtext in Vell's thistled calm armor enriches ambiguity; no tidy resolution, embracing counter-readings like Censors' confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: musical notation lens ("copy as she would copy violins," "braided between notes") modulates rhythmically under pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Vell's explanations pursue recruitment). Voice texture purposeful in lyric compression, eliding for glow pattern payoff at concert.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but overwrites high-pressure climax with stacked metaphors ("threads that curled... dust shimmered and whispered... mist held... ember... glow in time"), slightly muddling propulsion. No loops or scaffolds; purposeful simile pattern (thistles, snow, fish) taught early avoids artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of story famine, luminous lyrics reviving dust transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in open concert heightens stakes. No derivative echoes; particulars like Ashmouth's directions braid organically into library rebuild.</comment>
