<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's resourcefulness drives key choices like using reflections and swapping plates, with embodied fear ("swallowed the fear") at the pivot; minor slip in alternating summary of internal conflict rather than simultaneous impulses during rescue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore chain (courier fail → booth → ledger → lagoon path → press infiltration); closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with sirens' cost forcing escape, cost legible in "sirens finally converged."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Auric lagoon and reflections constrain pathfinding choice and charge final escape image; selective sensory details (wet stones, gold ripples) integrate via Mara's biased urgency, mirroring revisions without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resist erasure) tightens via causal escalation (booth intel narrows options to press theft); agency in tracing path forecloses smuggling, with visible cost in courier's raw wrists and sirens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of refusing indifference emerges organically from particulars (names/dates on plates vs. vagueness); final image of pages as "coded freedom" offers resonant CR reweighting revisions' rule-set with pursuit cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (old booths as "nails holding a painting"); rhythmic modulation under stress (short "click like a door in her chest"); dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Send the weather report").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (varied openings, propulsion in "worked fast, swapping"); minor overwriting in lagoon metaphors risks muddle but stays coherent and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revisionist dystopia via booth key and puddle-map tactics transforms tropes; risk in reflection-navigation pays off at closure, feeling inevitable from established world logic.</comment>
