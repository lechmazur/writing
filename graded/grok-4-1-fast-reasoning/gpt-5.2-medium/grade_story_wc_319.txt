<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Feral guardian's confession of terror softens his lunge into shared waiting, earning mutual renunciation of passage through embodied homesickness and contradictory hunger for certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as mist density and inward breathing cadence-shift to CR closure; pendant dulling with tag legibly costs passage for interior calm, anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden's frost-roses and open stacks constrain pacing boundary and doorway-drawing; recurring mist evolution mirrors internal reconfiguration to charge final "calm page" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Homesickness stake tightens via guardian's lunge met by wrist-catch endurance, foreclosing seam-opening under textural lens; conceptual cost undeniable in pendant's dulling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges via light-boundaries as "conversation," reweighted non-literally in tag's cataloged friendship without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (e.g., "color... past the last visible wavelength") rhythms with pressure, stable without slippage; guardian's rasp distinguishes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid, non-looped images; figurative pattern (foggy lucidity) taught early coheres without muddle in lunge/doorway peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal interiorizing exteriors synthesizes dream-library feralism into inevitable CR, risking bold lyricism that heightens homesick stakes organically.</comment>
