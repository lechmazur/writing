<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's polished calm from father's training drives micro-choices like dissuading rivals without raised voice, earning final endurance of pursuing his route amid collapse; contradictory impulses subtle in calm exterior vs. running mind, but embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as loop patterns build density from data bugs to bill realizations, culminating in CR closure: "the only honest escape is to mark it differently," with cost in shelved code and father's unresolved route; mosaic shards taught early via inheritance, legible transitions, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Circus train's lion car and dining car constrain choices as lab/refuge, charging final image; markers (chalk arrows, ribbons) mirror internal loops and guide escape, with dusky sensory details selectively urgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to break loops signaled early via data circles, escalates accumulatively through user traps and bill insight to data fix (too late), driven by narrator's agency; cost legible in lawsuits/collapse narrowing options to remaking markers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of imposed loops (conquerors, father, algorithms) emerges from bills/maps/markers, reweighted non-literally in final hinge image without moralizing; resonance from particulars like twice-taken routes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes stay still when my mind is running") biases noticing turns/markers; stable first-person POV with rhythmic modulation, minimal natural dialogue (Mara resignation) advances stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (dust like stage glitter) integrated into action; varied rhythm propels without loops, scaffold, or overwriting in peak realization beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber inheritance, navigation startup, circus train lab transforms loop trope via bills as repetition maps; risky mosaic heightens inevitability of remaking territory.</comment>
