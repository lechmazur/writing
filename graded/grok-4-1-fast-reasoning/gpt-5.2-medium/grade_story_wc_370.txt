<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marin's empathy embodied concretely in "map the stranger's panic, then stepped out slowly," driving pivotal reveal and offer to Lysa with earned endurance of solitude; contradictory kindness in hiding strengthens individualization. Backstory of sister's fire anchors without flattening pressure. Minor label-speak in "enlarged tranquility" slightly genericizes but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as paradox density builds from invitation error to cipher test and Archivist acceptance; CR closure in note "every mistake is a map, if you read with mercy" reweights premise with solitude's felt cost clearly on-page. Orientation anchored early in museum/library. Invitation-to-halves seam provides causal tightening without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hinged panel and "aisles labeled with contradictions" constrain hiding/reveal choices and charge final stacks image; sensory lamplight "pooled like honey" reflects empathetic perception. Specificity purposeful, no white-room. Environment guides paradox theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unearthing mistake wisdom signaled early tightens accumulatively via Lysa's panic and invitation cipher, forcing Marin's agency in halves placement; Archivist moment forecloses punishment path with relational cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in offer amid solitude. One deepening suffices, cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of errors as lanterns emerges organically from crumpled paper's "seam show" and nested cipher, resonant CR in note reweights without moralizing; ambiguity in crooked paths lingers meaningfully. Particulars like invitation drive insight over platitudes. No tidy binary, embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in "a passing cough sound like a confession" stable in Marin's limited third; rhythm modulates from slow breaths to midnight toll without drift. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in Lysa's stammer. No head-hopping, compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "fear had wrinkled the paper" advancing image/prose; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor paraphrase in repeated "mistake/nested paradox" phrasing (-0.3) but no loops or artifacts dull closure note. Concision strong, no scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Index of Unfinished Things and "errors could contain their own lanterns" premise fresh, synthesized via specific cipher test and invitation seam; risk in paradox library hidden in bland gallery heightens stakes organically. Transformation of mistake trope inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
