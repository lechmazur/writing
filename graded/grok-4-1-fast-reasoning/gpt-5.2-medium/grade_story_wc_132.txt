<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied internal conflict peaks in "her laugh snagged," with resistance via lists clashing against branching thoughts, earning the final witness reconfiguration with visible bodily cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density reconfigures boundaries; closure's Charged Poise in mailing findings/pressed leaf crystallizes options with cost of softened observer role, leaf as constraint throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis constrains rebuild choice, mirroring internal softening "like bark taking rain"; coastal salt/thunder evolves causally with events, charging final shoots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of observer boundaries deepens accumulatively via bodily tremors/nails, forcing release-control agency; cost legible in "intimacy...not in skin," narrowing to better-growth outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of yielded listening emerges via vines' choices; final leaf-on-tongue images reweight premise non-literally, embracing complexity without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in plant-biased noticing (roots toward runoff) sustains under stress; minimal dialogue circuitous/natural with boy, advancing indirectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (vines "sprawled in the mud"); varied rhythm propels without loops, metaphors coherent like "thoughts branched."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plant-empathy metamorphosis synthesizes ecology/identity freshly; leaf's gale-message inflects turns organically, risking subtle bodily risk without gimmick.</comment>
