<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilen's motivation to save Vey roots deeply in consistent traits like copper veins used as tuning fork at climax, with embodied struggle against diamond's hunger. Contradictory impulses emerge in balancing curse's erasure against preservation, earning final endurance. Minor telling in elders' softening consonants avoids peak deduction as it anchors stakes early.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from initial promise to Toma's rasp-matching, tightening at birdless night when unpatterned echoes threaten sameness, resolving in CR closure: canyon as new voice reprices language death with survival cost. Orientation anchors in first paragraph; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and tunnel constrain whispers and diamond placement, charging final travelers' image where rock translates touch to sound. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over sight) reflects Ilen's texture obsession; details evolve causally from wind-funneling to spiral-led resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate texture before silence—tightens via curse hunger pulling sounds deeper, forcing bird-pattern tactics; agency in aligning breaths to spiral forecloses erasure. Cost legible in Toma's death flattening echoes, reweighted by canyon's harmonics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of texture surviving as sound emerges from diamond's rasp to canyon library, final image repricing death as resonant endurance without moralizing. Subtext in flawed gem's hunger mirrors language's fraying, inviting ambiguity on preservation's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (textures as verbs) stable in single POV, modulating rhythm from quiet articulation to spiral-charged intensity. Minimal dialogue natural; diction purposeful, eliding for density paid off in echo layers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "skin threaded with metallic lines that caught the pale light and made listeners think of maps"); no loops, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught. Rhythm varies for propulsion, zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tactile language dying into sonic canyon library, transformed via bird geometries and cursed diamond; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. Final travelers' hearing inevitable from Vey particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
