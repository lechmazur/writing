<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to discover time's texture drives planting, entering maze, and releasing memories with embodied vertigo at center; Lio applies secondary pressure through shard and trapped gaze. Minor abstraction in "texture of time" lacks one contradictory impulse in pivotal free-choice, but closure change earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via moving photos to syrupy air, pattern break at woman's reveal, CR closure in photos-to-dust and maze simplification with legible cost ("rough, tender grain of now"). Orientation anchored early in garden; no shards violate defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden constrains via responsive tendrils to hyperbolic planting; halo fragment as micro-setting charges photos' movement and final rust-into-light image. Sensory hierarchy (river as pages, leaves as stars) filters through designer's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to calm dreaming bridge tightens via fragment-activated paths to center confrontation; under Textural lens, density forces endurance of vertigo, agency in circling fragment forecloses clinging with on-page cost (dust, absence).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time as bark vs. linear memory emerges via grainy woman and fading images, resonant CR in empty photo reweighting without moral ("memory could rejoin the living bridge"). No direct statement; ambiguity lingers in quake's tenderness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (paths "pull at fingertips," hedges "like repeating stars") biases toward hyperbolic curves; rhythmic modulation peaks in syrupy vertigo without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful (bridge "ribs," time "bark") taught early, payoff at closure without muddle or loops. Minor figurative density in opening acceptable for lyric texture; rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry calming dreaming garden, retrocognitive traps in photos transforms maze trope organically; risk in nonlinear time-texture inevitable at "let the maze consume its own map."</comment>
