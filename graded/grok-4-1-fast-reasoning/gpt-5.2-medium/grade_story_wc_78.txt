<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leeward's contradictory impulses shine when he lets the spar's danger "join the music," compelling a higher-stakes crew response; motivation intensifies credibly from tapping to teaching, with embodied stress in tree-climbing, but crew remains faceless collective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound layers build to path-revealing score; on-page CR closure in sailcloth aligning currents reconfigures drift-stake with conceptual cost of ongoing translation, not mastery; orientation anchors orchard/sea crisply by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pear tree constrains Leeward's freighter read and spar peril, charging final repair image; driftwood circle and kelp roots evolve tactilely with pulls/lurches, mirroring internal harmony amid chaos; sensory filter (waves' wants, cloud notes) biases urgently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant drift-to-lanes stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via squall/freighter density, narrowing to buoy-hammer improvisation; agency in dubbing forecloses smash-path with spar-cost, reweighting via mirrored storm; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hearing/playing patterns emerges organically from tapped obstacles to fractal path, reweighting premise in tar-repair image without moralizing; subtext in crew's rhythmic adherence invites ambiguity on obedience vs. translation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (clouds as notes, waves' becoming) biases selectively; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm with pressure, compressing diction in squall counts; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies propulsively, with fractal spirals mirroring stakes without loops; high density juggles image/action cleanly, but figurative weight ("sea held day in throat," fruit drumbeats) borders overwrite in squall beat, slightly dulling peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating orchard premise ingeniously synthesizes drift peril with sound-prophecy, transforming tropes via fractal scores and spar-beater; risk of lyric drift heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight through tar-mallet coda.</comment>
