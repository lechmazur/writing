<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—fear in throat yet resiliently radios code—forcing earned choice to merge timelines; final nod forecloses isolation with workman's cost. Interiority particular via thumb-tracing lines matching knots/stars. Flawless under pressure, no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (routes/knots/stars/ripples) tightens to RR closure as ferries merge via aligned radio, reweighting vanishings; cost legible in "seam held because they kept working it." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring hourglass constrains choice (traced, weighs promise) and charges final image (sand gathers as seam stitches); grotto's "blue salt light" and "interconnected ripples" mirror internal patterns purposefully. Sensory hierarchy via deckhand bias (coffee smell, rope lattice); no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt vanishings via merge) signaled early, deepens via radio code narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in aiming grotto alone forces trade-off (fear vs. ache). Cost felt in "permanent transient ache"; one tightening sufficient, charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence-through-work emerges organically via patterns stitching "seam"; final "workman's nod" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting transience without moral. Subtext in older Lina's smile and traded hourglass; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: deckhand notices "knots...lattice of rope...star chart"; voice modulates rhythmically ("engines...turning pages"). Radio dialogue sparse but subtextual (echoed bell/gulls); no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (advance pattern + atmosphere); rhythm varies (short peak sentences in grotto shimmer). Patterned metaphors cohere (liquid lines tug hourglasses) without muddle; no loops, scaffold, or filter stacks in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sideways clocks/patterns merge timelines via deckhand code, transforming vanishing trope; risk in surreal grotto pays off in inevitable nod. No derivative echoes; bold conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
