<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Mira's clinging (fear of hush vs. recording rasp) act in scene; Orrin's trait forces her patient micro-choices with embodied cost (trembling chalk hand). Final addition to archive earned by relational crucible. Exceptional under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via markers/rasp to capsule discovery; RR/Charged Poise closure reconfigures echo stake with felt cost in "tidal longing" and Orrin's relief. Cost legible in final tape playback image. Waiver on orientation as fog disorientation pays off at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog/sculptures constrain choices (rearranges paths) and charge closure (swallows arrows); driftwood/puddle mirror body attention. Sensory hierarchy (sound-hush dominant) reflects Mira's bias. Recurrent objects evolve causally with tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture aging sound) signaled early, tightens via Orrin's rasp (agency: press record) narrowing to archive deepening under accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in "intimate aging amplified" and foreclosed waiting hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (memory vs. hush) emerges from particulars (tapes, rasp, layered voices); final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in silences/gestures invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sound/echo bias); rhythmic modulation peaks at rasp ("future coughed through him"). Dialogue subtextual (warnings evade full prediction). Stable close third, no slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "magnetic hush thick as fog"); varied rhythm accelerates to closure without loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful, no muddle in peak rasp beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aging-sound archive/prophet-forgetting inevitable from particulars; risky poetic texture heightens stakes without gimmick. Bold fog-memory conceit transforms tropes.</comment>
