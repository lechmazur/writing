<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's survivor ribs and vow to record small gestures root motivation, driving ruthless unbinding with embodied contradiction (save history vs. personal risk); final writing choice earned via prior gesture observations, foreclosing loyalist rewrite with imprisonment cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: gesture patterns accumulate to message-prompted unbinding (DC via archive release), resolving to CR closure in broadsheets sparking succession; orientation anchored by post-120 words, cost legible in protagonist's imprisonment and real voice slip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains unbinding (heel clicks as prayer reach catch); chessboard/object-as-setting recurs beside opening and on ledge, charging final image; sensory integration (cold air of paper/violets) mirrors tactic through POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve gestures vs. erasure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via message then walking-unbinding under guard pressure; agency in ripping bundles forecloses loyalist path, cost (thunderous footsteps, imprisonment) alters tactics visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of luminous absence emerges organically from gestures/blinks to archive testimonies, reweighted in empty throne "fill[ing] with light" and pawnless board; resonant CR ending answers historian vow without moralizing, complexity in ruthless benevolence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (tapping fingers, tugged sleeves) biases noticing; rhythmic compression modulates stress (short sentences in descent); stable POV with no leakage, voice as character via gesture idiom.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.9<comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pawns gone, kings exposed" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops/artifacts dull closure; minor figurative density ("nomadic penumbra") purposeful and taught early without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis actor as gesture historian transforms tropes; walking-words method and gallery acoustics feel inevitable, risk-taking in accumulative absence motif heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
