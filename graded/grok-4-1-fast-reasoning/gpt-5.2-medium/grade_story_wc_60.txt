<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—skeptic doubt versus realistic imagination—act simultaneously in her mechanical reading of constellations and patient listening at the pedestal, earning the closure choice to carry memories despite ache. Interiority embodied in "defiant hush" and glowing doubt ties to lost childhood, compelling higher-stakes micro-choices like sliding the chip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of crumb trail and star-matching to revelation; on-page CR closure reweights premise with mother's hidden past and "ache" cost legible in final image of carrying light. Orientation anchored early in Fountain Square; tightening at door click narrows to underground payoff without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "chalky moons" and "wet stone that should not have existed" filter through Mara's skeptic priorities, constraining choices (crumb trail, gap) and charging closure via fountain echoes. Sensory hierarchy narrows to limescale glimmers under urgency; spatial choreography coherent from square to pedestal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unstick box tightens accumulatively through failed latch turn to patient listening reversal, forcing trade-off of impatience for release with felt cost in rehearsing water. Agency in micro-choices forecloses force path; pressure coheres to stance crystallization at revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of defiant remembering versus protected forgetting emerges organically from spill of scenes and mother's reveal, reweighting doubt in final non-literal image of brighter-glowing hush without moralizing. Particulars like geese shadows layer irony; ambiguity lingers in city's potential ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in skeptic filters ("pipes and valves"); rhythmic lyric voice modulates patiently from trail to hush, with purposeful compression taught early. No head-hopping; diction biased to Mara's grounded stars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "box opened like an eyelid" advances image and release); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, coherent metaphors like "ground up the city's missing water." Minor figurative density in opening fits accumulative pattern without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calcified crumbs as breadcrumb keys and mechanic constellations transforms trope into inevitable mechanic romance; risk in lyric CR revelation heightens stakes via personal cost without gimmickry.</comment>
