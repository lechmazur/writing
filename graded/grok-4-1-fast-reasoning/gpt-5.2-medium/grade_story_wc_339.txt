<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's analytic trait manifests in grief-as-equations and slate notes under dive pressure, clashing with surrender impulse; final reel release earns change with felt cost of foreclosing endless hunting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through discovery chain (box to reel to voice), yielding CR closure in reel unwinding and snow globe shake as reconfiguration of "holding on is drag."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library's "shelves pitched like ribs" and snow globe constrain choices, with flakes rising "with my pulse" charging final image of surrender.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of understanding letting go tightens accumulatively via reel discovery and Earhart's voice, forcing renunciation with cost in "let the reel unwind into the water."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Snow globe reprise reweights Earhart's "cleanest landing is to stop fighting the air," offering resonant answer to physics-of-letting-go theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Analytic perceptual signature ("silence has measurable pressure") remains distinct and modulates rhythmically with Dee's intimacy, stable first-person POV intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "paper turns to lace, ink becomes a bruise" propels without loops or overwriting, rhythmic variety sustains momentum to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesis of Earhart myth, sunken book-freighter, and grief-physics transforms tropes, with Dee's "Call me Dee" risking bold personification that heightens ingenuity.</comment>
