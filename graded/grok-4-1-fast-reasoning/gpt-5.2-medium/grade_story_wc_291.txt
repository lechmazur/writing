<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Artist's face-blindness creates genuine contradiction, embodied in methodical ledger and unifying opposites into sketch; micro-choice to offer painting dancers earns confession with relational cost. Sato and Maren apply clear pressure without stereotypes. Minor therapy-speak in "awaken dormant empathy" but anchored in private motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ribbon fragment → sketch from witness opposites → quarry visit → lance match and laugh trigger confession as DC with guilt/grief cost legible in "unite guilt with grief." Orientation anchored early via studio envelope and Sato's details. Two-shard structure (studio/quarry) transitions cleanly at dawn; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mist-quarry muffles footsteps, constraining entry and heightening fog-induced face-blind tension; calipers/pencils as micro-setting enable opposites unification. Sensory hierarchy (pond smell, clay boots via recount) reflects artist's methodical bias. Final slate-waterline hiding charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild cold case for empathy) signaled early, tightens causally via sketch twitching Maren's fingers and matching laugh/lance, forcing confession trade-off. Agency in dawn visit and pencil-lancing pierces story. Cost legible in procedural smothering and record erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites (cruelty/care, guilt/grief) emerges via sketch process and Maren's naming failure, reweighting premise in final "let the town finally feel" without moralizing. Resonance from blindness as "another kind of looking away" charges ending non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (sequence over recognition, opposites as mason's plumb) stable and biased; dialogue subtextual in Maren's "all ribbons look alike" evasion advances pressure. Rhythm modulates with intensity, prose texture distinct without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ribbon tells its own story: double knot"); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("laugh like broken glass," "kindness practiced to a shine") during buildup but purposeful for artist voice, not closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's opposites method transforms cold-case trope via methodical contradictions into confession; fresh synthesis of prosopagnosia, masque, quarry troupe feels inevitable. Risky dawn fog confrontation heightens without gimmick.</comment>
