<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (severing vs. linking scars) culminate in earned endurance at closure, where emptiness transforms without tidy resolution. Micro-choices under pressure, like placing shadow hands on scars, reveal values with visible relational cost. Final renunciation of full reconnection feels compelled by prior ritualistic traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from restless shadows to spilling starlight, tightening via ring rattle into ritual mending. On-page Charged Poise closure ("bridge...rebuild itself...to let him walk back") reconfigures absence with felt cost in persistent emptiness. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ashen chapel, warm rings, and spilling starlight constrain choices (mend threshold) and charge final image of knee imprints in ash. Sensory selection (wet ash pressing cracks) mirrors internal panic poetically, integrated into action without stalls. Recurring scars-as-doors evolve tactilely to reinforce seam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend encroaching grief vs. deliberate distance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through shadow choking to scar-linking ritual, narrowing options with agency in endurance. Visible cost: emptiness endures but de-poisoned, charging final image under lens. Escalation driven by her choices, no coincidences resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ritual absence/mercy emerges organically from scar-naming and bridge metaphor, reweighted in final image ("emptiness still present but no longer poison") without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications invites ambiguity on severance's price. Resonant non-literal answer to contact's cost via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("darkness folded like cloth"; shadows "restless and hungry"). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity, perceptual bias shapes noticing (grain reveals panic). No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (bridges "burned...with ritual") purposeful and consistent, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion (short panicked sentences amid chime). Varied syntax supports ear test; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Minor density in metaphors enhances without muddling peak scar-tracing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-crossing fantasy and scar-ritual transforms abandonment trope into inevitable reconfiguration. Bold lyric risks (threshold seam, memory-rings) heighten stakes organically. Irreplaceable premise angle on grief as solid choke yields memorable voice.</comment>
