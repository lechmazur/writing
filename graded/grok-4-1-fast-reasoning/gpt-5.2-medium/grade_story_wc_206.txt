<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivo's motivation roots deeply in his craft and Covenant-bound truth, with embodied tension in pinning the oathfern before descent. Micro-choices like using the tether for listening reveal character under pressure. Final mending choice feels earned by prior honesty constraint, though interior contradiction remains subtle rather than sharply simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory buildup from shop to chamber narrows to bargain and tuning. Closure as RR lands cleanly in "light poured up the pipes," reconfiguring midnight with cost in rust-flecked joints and honored promise. Orientation anchors firmly by second paragraph; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Resonance chamber as copper lungs constrains lies and enables harmonics, charging climax. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations on teeth, wire tremors) reflects Ivo's professional ear. Final rust flecks evolve causally, mirroring internal mend without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim light) signaled early, deepens via Thief's confession changing knowledge to misalignment. Under textural lens, cadence shift in tuning forecloses theft path with agency and rust-cost legibility. One tightening suffices, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of honest repair amid decay emerges via particulars like oathfern and rust approval, without statement. Final tinkersong box reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity in midnight's softened bow. Resonance inextricable from Ivo's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV stable in Ivo's perceptual signature of metallic moods and lullabies. Voice texture modulates rhythmically with descent pressure, diction biased to artisan senses. Thief's "scraped brass" voice distinct and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines like "silence pressed on Ivo's teeth" propel via image over scaffold. Metaphors cohere in musical/rust pattern without muddle. Minor repetition of "mending" purposeful, varying syntax supports ear-test rhythm to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork thief and rust covenant transforms repairman trope via intangible mending. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in chamber bargain, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
