<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mara's "desperately jocular" grin that "falls" at midnight, earning her vulnerability and the narrator's companionship choice with relational cost. Interiority concrete via embodied warmth of rock and shared silence. Flaws complicate without hedging; micro-choices in exchanges reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumor density builds to rock reveal, catalyzing exchange chain as CR closure where rock cools from completion, reweighting loneliness with conceptual cost in passing it on. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in station details. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station's ivy and platform constrain neutral meeting and group occupation, charging final "polite anarchy" image. Sensory selective (warm rock, wind-pushed tickets) via POV bias toward fragments/maps. Micro-setting (suitcase altar) guides rock handling and reciprocity rule.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant loneliness stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via rock's rule forcing exchanges, narrowing isolation with visible cost in cigarette-for-coat chain. Agency in matching Mara's trades culminates in walk-home acceptance. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from rumor chains to rock rule to platform favors, resonant in "cures that work are the ones you pass on" without stating moral. Final suitcase note reweights premise non-literally. Complexity in Mara's hidden need avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "jokes the way others made fire" and biased noticing of scribbled tickets as maps. Dialogue subtextual (Mara's hat-tip reveals jocularity masking need); rhythm modulates with intensity. Stable first-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "grin's bright but hungry" advances character/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative purposeful without muddle in peak exchanges. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moon rock reciprocity in disaster logistics synthesizes fresh angle on loneliness, transforming tropes via rumor chains and "cheerful thefts." Risky "polite anarchy" platform hum inevitable from particulars; no hedging.</comment>
