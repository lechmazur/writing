<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chivalrous thief's contradictory impulses shine in sparing the Skywright via gentle knock while pursuing theft, earning the final embrace of unknown; interiority particular via sundial's "warm as a pulse," with flaws (past failure) compelling higher stakes without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds seamlessly from infiltration to chess swap revelation ("Serren is bound atop") therefore direct rescue; on-page DC closure in sundial snap and leap off ledge reconfigures sky with legible risk cost in "let go of the railing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains choices via moaning stairs, cracking chains, and wind-torn cloak, charging final ledge step; "wrong sky churned, as if... repainting with a wet brush" mirrors internal abandon while filtering through thief's playful perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue/amend failure) tightens causally via swap's knowledge change narrowing to top platform risk; agency in micro-choices like flask distraction forces trade-offs, with climax cost in storm-trust leap unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder amid chivalry emerges via chess cipher and sundial's courage measure, culminating in non-literal resonant answer: "cautious abandon again" as map-entry leap reweights promise-keeping with playful cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("sacredly playful laughter") modulates rhythm with pressure, stable POV via embodied notices like "fingers studied their keys"; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in pawn-to-e4 feint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "swapped... as neatly as prayer beads" advances action/voice); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle even in peak wind-torn climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess secrets in ice spire and sundial-as-courage transforms thief tropes via "key in the sky" as choice; risk-taking in wrong-sky premise heightens stakes organically to inevitable map-leap hindsight.</comment>
