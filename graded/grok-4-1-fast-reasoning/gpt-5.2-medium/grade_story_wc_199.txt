<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's contradictory patience (sorting hush) vs urgency (prodding spirals) acts in scene; final public honoring forecloses private rituals with communal exposure cost, rooted in monument-building trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as leaf discoveries density-build to vault opening; CR closure in "LIFT" leaf steadies arbor with legible cost of unsealed histories, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ashen arbor's groaning roots and falling leafscript constrain prodding choices; final steadying pearl-gray sky charges image as micro-setting payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert descent via decoding) deepens accumulatively through monument-pressing revelations; foreman's laugh forces agency, vault prod bears exposure cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Monuments reweight folklore theft into shared memory; final persistent "LIFT" leaf resonates as non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("mossy delight creep up his ribs") biases toward folklore; rhythmic modulation sustains under hush pressure, foreman dialogue sparse but dismissive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("pods tick like clocks"); no loops or muddled metaphors dull prod-to-LIFT cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor feeding on names synthesizes fresh premise; leaf-monument accumulation risks lyric bolding stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
