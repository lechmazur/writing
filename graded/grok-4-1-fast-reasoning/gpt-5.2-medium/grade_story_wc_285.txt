<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan's grief-rooted attentiveness yields concrete micro-choices like using the yarn needle on vellum, earning the closure scratch with embodied cost in "anger could finally percolate"; contradictory impulses (drive fog despite grief) act in scene. Senn applies pressure via confession. No stock phrasing; voice particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to pattern break at "gutters went still," delivering Charged Poise RR in vellum scratch and Mara reunion with Senn's spoken cost. Orientation anchored in first sentence; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog, ticking gutters, and ferry constrain choices (wait, cross only when ticking ceases), charging final image of silence and lanterns. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (coachman's ambient cues); details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal/restore Mara via true promise) signaled early, tightens via needle-reading and demand for spoken vow, narrowing to ferry-crossing agency with Senn's relational cost legible in "I owe, I repent, I restore."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of clarifying buried promises emerges via palimpsest events, reweighted non-literally in final scratch and "promises... were never erased but clarified"; resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (ambient awareness filtering details); rhythmic diction modulates tension, e.g., "senses wide" in ferry steering. Sparse dialogue subtextual and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied syntax accelerates to closure without loops or scaffolds; figurative coherence (ticking, fog patterns) purposeful, no muddle in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms bargain trope via palimpsest-reading coachman and yarn-needle forensics; risk in lyric density heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at vellum scratch.</comment>
