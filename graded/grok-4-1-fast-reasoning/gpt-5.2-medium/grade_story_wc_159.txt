<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied foxglove regret constraining choices; motive intensifies through journey to repair, earning shift from regret to gratitude. Contradictory persistence amid desolation acts in scene, as in steadying via routine during Hall of Apologies passage. Final endurance of tending forecloses isolation with felt ongoing cost. Minor lack of simultaneous impulses acting prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of deserted marvels builds to repair and song release as Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early in opal library routine. Closure cost legible in softened regret and imagined future visitors. Single tightening via bamboo discovery suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (vitrified petals, dusted glass) filter through caretaker bias, constraining climb and journey. Recurring bamboo/object charges final lighting image, mirroring internal states purposefully. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent across wings. Environment subtly guides repair choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via museum traversal and chime grief realization. Agency in repair forecloses mute orchids path with visible cost in ongoing rounds. Escalation density reweights regret; one deepening sufficient. Charges final image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending desolation emerges organically from particulars like cracked chime as lodged goodbye. Final image of names filling aisles offers resonant answer to preservation question, reweighting prior marvels. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in foxglove softening. Protagonist arc inextricable from emergent complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic idiom (prisms of breath, upward fountain); single POV stable, close and biased. Rhythm modulates with pressure, compressing at repair flare. Purposeful elision of song scraps taught early, pays off legibly. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite figurative layering. Propulsion weaves detail into action, e.g., lamp flaring on bamboo lift. Minor overwriting risk in museum descriptions, but pattern-taught and purposeful for textural lens. Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis: orchids storing name-tones, extinct feelings museum transforms tropes organically. Bold risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable particulars like carved bamboo. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established pattern. No derivative hedging; singular vision coherent.</comment>
