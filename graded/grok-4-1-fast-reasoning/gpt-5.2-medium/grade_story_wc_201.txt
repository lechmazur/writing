<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in proprioceptive "confession" angles and trauma-linked tremors driving micro-choices; final realization earned through layered fear spikes. Minor slip: slight diagnostic tone in "mathematics of mercy" naming feels articulated pre-struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from strap cue to knee sequence to tree proofs, landing CR closure where voice-aloud reading + pollen surge reconfigures mercy with release cost legible in "map in my skin." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forest constrains via glowing trunks/equations only under violet, body urges translating bark; recurring strap/cedar charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (metal/sap air, moss needles) filters through enhanced POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover mercy computations amid trauma) tightens accumulatively via flashes narrowing to function realization; agency in strapping rosary/walking coordinates forecloses carrying torturers' weight. Cost felt in shaking voice/pollen burn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy function "grows when harm admitted," resonant in aloud reading to trees sans moralizing; final pollen/strap image reweights premise with tortured's release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in enhanced sensing ("every joint reports"); rhythmic prose modulates tension beautifully, stable first-person with no leakage. Voice prose-as-character reflects fractured proprioception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel; purposeful lyric metaphors (e.g., "trees write guilt in invisible ink") taught early without muddle. Minor figurative density in peak clearing beat borders overwrite but serves texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of torture-tuned body reading forest archive transforms penance trope; risk in nonlinear trauma flashes heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in rings/proofs image.</comment>
