<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sava's motivation to find "the quiet in the storm" drives all micro-choices, from ice-crack reading to conjuring, with embodied tension in "breathed until her ribs matched the cave's pulse." Contradictory impulses surface in avoiding panic that "would only feed the surge," earning the final bargain. Exceptional internal specificity without epiphanies; hairline abstraction in poetic repose slightly tempers peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibration density builds from ringing corridors to Forge climax, reconfiguring caves via hush-net with legible cost in Sava's pulse-matching will. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page in stone-bargain contact creating "new crack patterns... as agreement." One tightening via ice-map to crystal wall suffices; orientation anchored early in cave arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Harmonic caves constrain via "pressure downstream" and Forge amplification, charging final recovered "layered music." Sensory hierarchy (ripples tingle wrists, heartbeats amplify) filters through Sava's expertise. Ice fissures and crystal honeycomb evolve causally, mirroring hush without overt symbolism; micro-setting (echo stone) shapes conjuring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet pocket amid surge) signaled early tightens accumulatively to beings' refugee repricing, narrowing options via Forge redirect. Agency in conjuring forecloses violence-path with embodied cost ("steady will... drawing order from resonance"). Minor slip: ethical calculus toward beings emerges late, but charges closure without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-from-chaos emerges via hush-bloom shifting beings from "ravenous" to settled, answered non-literally in "caves... have a place to rest." Particulars like moss-rain image avoid platitudes; refugee thunder-thoughts add ambiguity without false balance. Final map-update reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (harmonics as maps, ripples tingling) biases noticing; voice texture modulates rhythm from "metallic patience" to hush-softening. Elevated diction fits Sava's expertise without register drift; purposeful compression teaches pattern, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative layering ("net that wrapped... slowed its frantic flicker") borders overwriting in climax beat without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; "bloom of hush" specificity replaces generics. Minor scaffold in repeated "gently luminous" phrasing nudges below 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic sci-fant (vibration-drinking beings, hush-conjuring) transforms tropes via cave-logic and refugee repricing. Risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes; "Forge of Listening" turn inevitable from ripple priors. Non-obvious hush-as-moss elevates ingenuity.</comment>
