<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the drumming that reveals the brother's memory despite Sato's flinch ("my rebellion had become audible"), earning the mutual holding of the trance with neural overload cost; parallel losses deepen both characters without stereotypes. Interiority particular via rhythms and tastes (e.g., "tasted her childhood winter"). Final endurance of solo drumming seals earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layering memories and sounds to Charged Poise closure: narrator returns alone to drum and breathe, reconfiguring memory-sharing with lingering sorrow cost legible in "auroral sorrow lingering like afterimage." Orientation anchored early in garden entry; no lens ambiguity. One tightening via alarms suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden reeds and lagoon constrain choices (drumming amplifies memories, lagoon glows with shared faces) and charge final solo perch image; sensory hierarchy (sound dominant, narrowing to vibrations under trance) reflects POV urgency. Spatial choreography coherent on rim. No white-room; micro-setting as resonant crucible elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect brother via entanglement) tightens accumulatively through Sato's parallel loss and alarms forcing stance to hold trance despite "neural overload"; agency in taps/hums steers, foreclosing escape with brain-burn risk cost. Coherent pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as shared witness emerges implicitly from lagoon faces and final solo drumming, reweighting premise without moral ("they did not ask for bodies, only for witnesses"); resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, counter-reading in Sato's confession lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musical diction ("memories as chords," "waves learning to speak") modulates rhythmically under stress; stable first-person with no leakage. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("not meant for resurrection"). Experimental compression taught early via garden echoes, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "cold fire spread... lagoon answered, brightening in rings") with varied rhythm; figurative pattern (harmonics, auroral) consistent without muddle in peak trance. Minor scaffold in reflective opener, but no loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic neuroscience and grief ritual in gold-algae lagoon transforms memory trope; risk in overload defiance heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via parallel dreams. No derivative echoes; bold perceptual angle memorable.</comment>
