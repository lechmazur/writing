<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's skepticism yields to embodied contradiction—throat tightens yet she seals the jar—earning her final choice to build a workshop, with Sol's clinical pressure forcing micro-turns. Internal conflict acts in scene via refusal to lose twice but choosing distance. Voice particular: skeptic's bright laugh in dim ward reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers, lattices, slate patterns builds to RR closure in jar labeling, reweighting stake with cost (ghostly resolve forecloses clinging). Single scene (garden-ward) coherent; orientation anchored in first paragraph. No causality breaks; shell revelation deepens without unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet garden and glasshouse ward constrain via resonance setup and jar risks, charging final dew-lit exit image. Sensory selective/POV-biased: leaves "tragically radiant" mirror grief frequency. Micro-setting (seashell, copper rings) evolves tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive vs. keep) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shell's murmur revealing brother's choice, forcing Mira's renunciation with throat-cost. Agency in compromise alters tactics; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. Minor slip: Sol's offer eases too smoothly without deeper complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (memories as tools/prisons) emerges from shell-to-jar arc, final workshop image reweights premise non-literally: absence as hinge. Subtext in Sol's softening eyes vs. clinical voice; earned irony in city's fear vs. Mira's action. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in sealed access.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV Mira; perceptual signature in resonant metaphors biases to skeptic's ear (panes tremble). Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual: Mira's laugh evades smuggler label, Sol persuades via compromise. Rhythmic modulation peaks at slate revelation; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "petals drinking the remaining purple sky" advances atmosphere/foreshadows). Rhythm varies, read-aloud propulsive; figurative consistent (resonance motif) without muddle. Minor overwrite in opening lanterns/quarantine simile slightly pads pre-stake, but no loops or scaffolds touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh premise: memory-quarantine via jars/resonance transforms relic tropes organically. Risky lyric synthesis inevitable in hindsight—shell split as promise hinges independence. Non-obvious: archiving enables action beyond gates.</comment>
