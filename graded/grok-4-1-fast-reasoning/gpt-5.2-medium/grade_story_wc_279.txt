<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inez's social perception of pauses and jaw-tightening drives precise micro-choices like mandala-mapping and tile-tapping, earning her realization of guided unlearning. Boy's smudge reveals hierarchy of values with cost to perfection. Contradictory motive—not forgetting but finding meaning in mess—acts in scene without epiphanic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist echoes accumulate to emergent hush, tightening via spirals and tapped proverb fragments to CR closure where tile reconfigures unlearning as "work" with conceptual cost in shared doubt map. Orientation anchored early in grotto during unlearning; no lens ambiguity. Single scene causality intact, cost legible in softened phrases settling "like grains into grooves."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics constrain choices, bending speech via tile to hush that pressures chant; mist and stone enable tactile mandala mapping moods/ripples. Recurring lilac hue and sand charge final image of breathing cave and smudged ring. Sensory hierarchy (chalk dust, warming tile) reflects Inez's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake against unlearning accumulates density via hush growth and mandala spirals, one tightening when tapped proverb forces teacher's relief/renunciation of blankness. Agency in interjection forecloses scolding path with felt relational cost; pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise in boy's question/smudge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in forgetting's mess emerges via hushed proverbs settling in mandala, reweighting unlearning as "guided" work without statement. Final image of smudged ring offers non-literal answer: "meaning... only lived while it was being touched," charging prior residue with ambiguity of choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (patterns in sand/breath, chalk birds) stable in close third; diction modulates from lilac mist to fevered tile under pressure. Boy's blurted proverb and question carry subtext natural to child; no head-hopping, elisions taught via echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short interjection taps amid flowing mist); density high, metaphors consistent (lilac/hush/sand) without muddle or loops. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but integrates propulsively; closure image crisp: "smudging it... laughed softly."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unlearning city's echo-grotto synthesizes erasure with acoustic/memory tools into fresh premise; tile flake's bend from repeat to "soft waiting" risks boldly, heightening stakes via hush without gimmick. Final reconfiguration of relic as "tool for this new listening" feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
