<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of blithe joy amid grief embodied in humming while trimming yew and dirt under nails; gardener's micro-choices like decoding tapestry reveal values hierarchy, earning final planting with relational cost to echoes. Alvera's grief particularized in shining eyes like warm statue. Flawless under pressure, no label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density via tapestry decoding tightens knowledge of intentions, leading to CR closure in echoes easing and sapling plant reweighting shroud-to-velvet with conceptual cost of sheltering others. Orientation anchored early (gardener, cemetery, Alvera by ~100 words). No ambiguity, constraint in cipher shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silo's velveteen gloom and blue walls swallowing sound constrain secrecy; stars match tapestry pattern, charging final sapling image under star-cold roofline. Sensory hierarchy (smoke/lavender smell cues rumors) POV-filtered via gardener's grave-counting. Evolving details mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intentions' shape) signaled early, deepens via cipher revelation narrowing to smuggling protection; agency in decoding/digging forecloses ignorance with cost of confirming fear/shelter branch. Pressure coheres accumulatively, live clock echo tightens patience game. Minor swappability in ledger find dings from 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intentions as branching roots emerges from stitches/echoes, resonant CR in "echoes ease... finally rests" reweighting joy/grief without moral. Subtext in Alvera's love/fear question answered non-literally via sheltering clarity. No tidy binaries, ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "counting colors the way I count graves"; rhythmic control modulates from quiet prayer to charged planting. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Alvera's midgame death admission). Stable single POV, no leakage; compression taught early via echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax (e.g., "order could keep the dead from drifting"); zero loops, no scaffold. Purposeful metaphors consistent (roots, velvet), no muddle in peak decoding beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess cipher in tapestry smuggling transforms tropes organically; tapestry border as star-map/ledger key inevitable in hindsight. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes via echoes concept without gimmick. Bold, non-obvious premise commits fully.</comment>
