<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to probe margins yields concrete micro-choices like scanning with clipboard sensors and chalk-mapping, earning the climactic pseudonym invention and trap; interiority feels embodied in nostalgic ties to grandmother's whistle and father's pail without diagnostic labels. Courier's tremble adds secondary pressure, revealing shared stakes. Contradictory impulses surface in balancing client duty against investigative pull, with visible cost in guiding her to the hatch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: margin impressions accumulate via chalk codes to hatch discovery, reconfiguring stakes into trap-setting CR with felt cost in interception exposure; single scene anchors orientation early ("golden arcade at dawn"). No lens ambiguity; causal linkages (scan→match→guide) narrow options without unkept setups. Final mailing image crystallizes before/after with undeniable pressure on mail's hidden truths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Golden arcade's tiles-as-envelope and chalk walls constrain choices, charging final mailing; dawn light and drone pigeons filter through POV's nostalgic bias, mirroring internal states via "warm bars" vs. intercepting shadows. Sensory hierarchy sharpens to pressure/temperature residues in margins. Recurring floor projection tests names, evolving with plot to trap layer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (untraceable note amid traces) signaled early tightens via margin ghosts ("DO NOT TRUST THE ARCHIVE") forcing tactic shift to hatch/trap; agency in on-spot pseudonym peaks with courier guidance, foreclosing blind delivery at legible cost (thief announcement risk). Accumulative escalation reweights via deepening metadata reads; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of edges holding truth emerges organically from margin scans and chalk under tiles, culminating in CR where "futuristic nostalgia" reweights mail premise without moralizing; subtext in courier's drift to mirrors implies archive distrust. Final image answers central question (can mail be clean?) via trap's whisper, embracing ambiguity of reborn envelopes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ghost-notes" and "staccato signature" biases toward marginal details; voice modulates rhythmically from calm listing to urgent hatch shadow. Stable first-person with no leakage; sparse dialogue ("my best work") carries goal-driven subtext naturally, advancing plot via handoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "ebony clipboard... where my own sensors were embedded" advances tool/character/action); varied syntax/rhythm passes ear test, with purposeful metaphors like "dried leaves" charging hatch image without muddle. Zero loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "chalk codes layered beneath, a trap."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surface-mail metadata as emotion reader transforms pseudonym trope into fresh metadata-thief hunt; risk in sci-fi literary blend (chalk hopscotch as code) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via margin calibration. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
