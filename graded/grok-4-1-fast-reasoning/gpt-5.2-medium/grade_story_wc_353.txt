<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symphonically minded trait roots concrete micro-choices like reading cracks as notes, with embodied contradiction in wanting orchestral sound but settling for bone-vibrations; final plan to share earns from prior tactile persistence, showing flawed stubbornness without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from single wire to grove-swaying chord, landing Charged Poise closure in "promising to keep reading the cracks" with felt cost of enduring muteness; orientation anchors immediately in grove/path post-hedgehog uncurl; no shards, seamless scene holds lens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tactile micro-setting (alder trunks carrying strain, moss-buried sculpture) constrains material choices and charges final image of insulator as "pale moon"; sensory hierarchy favors touch over sight, mirroring POV urgency without catalog; spatial choreography tracks wire-lashing to root-travel vividly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music from silence) signaled early tightens texturally via deepening from one quivering wire to shared stillness with siskins/hedgehog; agency in patient empathy forecloses audible sound for vibrational endurance, charging final image with conceptual cost of persistent strain-reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unheard pressures as connective music emerges organically from crack-intervals and wire-tremors, reweighted in final "nobody is unheard if someone keeps moving toward them" without stating; resonant image of left insulator answers silence via touch, embracing ambiguity of mute world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with tactile perceptual signature ("feels how each trunk carries strain the way a body carries grief"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in short plucking sentences; purposeful compression teaches silence-pattern early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tightens until the wire quivers under her fingers like a held breath" advances action, sensation, stakes); zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm supports lyric propulsion; metaphors consistent without muddle in peak vibration beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Muffle silence, crack-scores, and touch-orchestration transforms familiar grief tropes into tactile ingenuity; risk in vibration-music pays off inevitably at shared plan, with irreplaceable porcelain-wire bridge heightening stakes organically.</comment>
