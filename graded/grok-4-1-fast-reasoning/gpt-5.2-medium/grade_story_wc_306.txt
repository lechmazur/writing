<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the lantern room when Mara rehearses selling Sile an easy story but wears the cloak instead, earning her honest confrontation; embodied ache and micro-choices like entering unarmed reveal flaws under pressure. Final renunciation of insincerity carries visible cost to her paid role. Sile's flinching response forces her boundary-keeping sit, deepening the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as chime codes, mirror absence, and cloak texture deepen nuance stake toward Charged Poise closure: Mara's self-wrapping and honest delivery reconfigure certainty with felt cost in her "paid conscience felt briefly like her own." Orientation anchors in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity. One tightening via mirror's eyeless face suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse at dawn, chimes, and salt-oiled stairs constrain choices—chimes dictate entry unarmed, cloak proximity tests nerve; mirror shard charges final image by reflecting past clients. Sensory hierarchy (gulls' wheeling, dawn-drinking threads) reflects Mara's priorities without catalog. Spatial choreography tracks spiral ascent cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unhook/deliver cloak tightens accumulatively via chimes' distrust warning and mirror's hollowing, forcing endurance of nuance over easy sale; wearing cloak forecloses parcel-carrying option with relational cost to Sile. Agency in self-wrapping and ash-placed shard drives peak. Cost unmistakable in tightened cloak and risked honesty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nuance invading certainty emerges organically from cloak's motive-covering weave, chime warnings, and mirror's blindness image, reweighting premise in final nod without moralizing. Subtext in "sincerely insincere" smile lingers via irony of her own shift. Ending image answers question resonantly: cloak as shared promise bends stones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (chimes as letters, cloak as smoke) biases toward doubt; rhythmic modulation quickens in ascent, breathes in lantern pause. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in Sile's flinch-nod. Voice texture distinct: syntax mirrors loosening thoughts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hollow mirror shard... reflected nothing but light and made her feel watched") propels; rhythm varies for ear, no loops/scaffold. Minor density ding for stacked metaphors in lantern room ("drink the dawn and breathe it back as questions") without harm to closure. Zero artifacts in peak; varied openings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conscience trade as lighthouse ritual transforms tropes via coded chimes and doubt-cloak; risk in symbolic absence (eyeless mirror) heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious angle: permission-seeking client yields to unpaid honesty. Inevitable hindsight from early chimes to bending stones.</comment>
