<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between eroded grand ambition ("run the carousel") and earned renunciation to "small repairs," embodied in flinching at ghost's voices and blinking away images with visible cost at exchange climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via fragment density building to lagoon's syllable-stitching and ghost negotiation; on-page RR closure in bolt-fix and chronology alignment with felt cost of faded ambition, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon's "water looping in deliberate spirals that click like gears" anchors surreal specificity, constrains ghost negotiation via mirrored water and undersides-of-eyelids development, charges final rim-walking image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ghost negotiation signaled early, tightens via fragment release forcing image-payment trade-off under Accumulative lens; agency in precise kneeling/clicking forecloses ambition path with legible blink-cost at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time/regret emerges organically from shard-pinning to ghost's three-age nod; resonant non-literal close in "chronologies inside her align just enough," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in "yesterday arrives as a smell and tomorrow as a bruise"; rhythmic control modulates fractured lyricism to charged poise at "step away without looking back," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/scaffold; surreal metaphors like "clouds rub their bellies" cohere via taught pattern, propel to closure without overwriting in peak ghost exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scavenger-ghost negotiation via camera-wheel shards in cloud-lagoon world; risk-taking surreal logic inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via irreplaceable chronal bruise/cost.</comment>
