<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eira's patience as contradictory impulse acts in scene via slow knees and aching joints under ritual pressure; final endurance sealing the plate earned by prior micro-choices with visible bodily cost. Cartographer arrival forces relational micro-choice without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build (patterns → flare → glow → seal); Charged Poise closure in aurora fraction-move reconfigures safekept light's purpose with patience-cost legible in "joints ached."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Crater orchard constrains choices (snow for patterns, ice-capped well for seal) and charges final image (plate shining in well); body-as-micro-setting (posture rituals) mirrors internal pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken/seal starlight via heart-map) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via heartbeat intervals glowing blue; agency in sealing forecloses leak/panic path with joint-ache cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared stillness emerges organically from particulars (heartbeat lines over sleeping child); final aurora shift offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting world's breath-holding without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (wrist rhythms, sap thuds); diction/rhythm modulate purposefully from ritual slowness to charged invitation, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "flash-paper flare without smoke" packs action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, figurative coherence in peak seal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy-heart-maps in post-meteor orchard transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric Accum lens heightens stakes via irreplaceable plate-seal image.</comment>
