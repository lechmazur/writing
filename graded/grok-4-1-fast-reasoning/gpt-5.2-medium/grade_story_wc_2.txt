<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's "uncertainly certain" trait roots consistent motives, shown in embodied memory of certainty burning the harbor while improvising past the spray; contradictory impulses peak in the bargain, earning closure with visible cost to rigid planning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain—feathers/clocks to conservatory trapdoor to waterfall chamber—holds Hybrid (Causal dominant) lens; Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page as compass warms/clicks and chiming shifts, reconfiguring time with town's felt cost of pretense.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gears as "stepping teeth in the slick rock" constrain improvisation choice behind waterfall; final "shook soot from the leaves" charges reconfigured image, with sensory hierarchy (wet earth/smoke, roots like hair) mirroring priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to befriend uncertainty tightens via pattern clues to Corin confrontation; agency in bargain forecloses rage-path with on-page cost to admiral's proof/report, legible in probability clock proposal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of doubt over certainty emerges organically from clock dualities and fire's lesson; final "chiming minute had shifted... to the one they chose" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("stopped hands tell useful lies," "accidents repeated"); dialogue goal-driven/subtextual in Corin's confession and bargain, rhythm modulates under pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density in chamber ("gray silt... brass star glimmered"); propulsion peaks in tunnel with varied syntax/rhythm, coherent metaphors (vines reclaimed benches) sharpen closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Probability clock bargain transforms lost-object quest into fresh uncertainty synthesis; risk-taking in subterranean currents motif heightens stakes, inevitable from clock-feather-ashes particulars.</comment>
