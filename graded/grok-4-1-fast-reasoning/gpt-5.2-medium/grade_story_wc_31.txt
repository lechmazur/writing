<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in choosing and speaking the vow—"hear without wanting, to see without grasping"—earned by prior synesthetic glimpses and tag discovery, with embodied cost in air running low.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from pier lanterns to underwater library vow; CR closure reconfigures truth-as-shield to lens via glowing card and violet bell, with legible cost in fading air and recommitted pier walks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library shelves "furred with silt" and porthole constrain exploration and air, charging final image of fading lanterns as "green and gold"; synesthetic sensory filter reflects lamplighter bias throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to discover sound's color tightens via tag-to-drawer click flashing "bright blue," forcing vow agency; density deepens to violet dawn fill, unmistakable cost in low air foreclosing grasp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final porthole image of lanterns as "silver rain" and "fading crackle" non-literally answers hiding-behind-truth premise, reweighting prior sensory hints with vow's release without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature—"harbor bells... brush my eyes with pale green"—and rhythmic modulation from hush to "soft thunder" sustain first-person intimacy without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in lines like "shelves furred with silt, books swollen but intact" propels without loops; figurative consistency (light/sound colors) taught early avoids muddle even in peak vow glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic lamplighter vowing luminous truths in sunken hotel library synthesizes fresh undersea self-discovery; risk of underwater scene heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
