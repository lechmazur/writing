<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's refusal of cruelty from exile ties directly to his precise correlations and final renunciation, earning the closure choice with embodied contradiction via worry stone under pressure. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in chess moves testing power vs restraint. Flawless trait integration without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns build to silence alphabet, reconfiguring covenant stakes into public renunciation with narrow vote as legible cost. Orientation anchors in first paragraph. Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly on councillors' vote and sky's response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus constrains choices via reactive dust to chess pieces, charging final board arrangement in hall. Twilight evolves causally without collapse, mirroring restraint. POV-biased sensory hierarchy (compasses, spirals) integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher covenant before phase) deepens accumulatively through correlations narrowing to restraint message, forcing trade-off in public renunciation. Agency in pawn moves tests options with dust breakage as felt cost. Narrow vote crystallizes pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honoring cycles over binding emerges organically via dust crescents breaking under power moves, reweighting Collegium betrayal in final image of deepening twilight sans collapse. No moralizing; resonant via particulars like worry stone on king square.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with chess-perceptual signature (e.g., "markers for stars") biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically under interpretive stress. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (Mera's plea, Sable's proof placement). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images (dust spirals, silence intervals) without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for quiet intensity. Minor figurative density in opening holds pattern, not overwriting, charging nexus murmurs. Clean propulsion to vote image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chess tutor decoding magnetic covenant via silence alphabet transforms premise into fresh synthesis of precision, restraint, and sky betrayal. Risky lyric accumulations heighten ingenuity without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from dust-chess correlations.</comment>
