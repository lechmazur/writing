<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation intensifies from decoding to shared grief via concrete promise and dream choice; embodied tears-into-salt and faltering voices show contradictory impulses acting in rite. Nera applies pressure through confession, forcing micro-choice to carry burden. Final rite earns change with relational cost, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stalled charts to dream revelation to temple rite CR, reweighting decoding as faith-keeping with ongoing star-scheduled cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; shards taught early via chronicling pattern, transitions legible. Dream pulse as tightening pays off precisely at "quiet weight settling into the ribs."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Variable stars constrain dream decoding and charge final image over broken roof; salt flats, brass tools, dream courtyard tactile and POV-filtered via chronicler lens. Sensory pulses match urgency, evolving causally to cool sanctuary air. No white-room; micro-objects like telegram anchor shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode + share grief) signaled early, tightens via dream reversal changing knowledge; rite agency forecloses isolation with felt cost (exhaling air, shared footprints). Accumulative density reweights under lens; moral calculus of witnessing divides burden without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shared burdens emerge implicitly from promise, rite, final star schedule; CR reweights vault as ritual without moralizing—"decoding... keeping faith" answers isolation via particulars. Subtext in pulsing syllables vs. brother's trembling hand; ambiguity lingers in repeating returns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct chronicler voice in perceptual bias (stars breathing, words as bridges); stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically with dream intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("heals with words" promise); no head-hopping, elision taught via logs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (ship stalled to footprints path) without muddle in peak rite. Varied syntax propels from confession to "air... exhaling"; zero paraphrase, precise connectors like "because words are bridges."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreams, variable stars timing grief vault transforms tropes organically; risk in mosaic shards heightens resonance without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from star catalogs to plaster seal.</comment>
