<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular ("dust never does, and ghosts only point"), with micro-choices under pressure like kneeling to analyze dust revealing hierarchy of values; final burden earned via prior engagements without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: dust patterns therefore cracks therefore ghost guidance therefore mechanism release, with Charged Poise closure ("barrel warmed... reminding me why I keep looking up") legible in final pocket image carrying conceptual cost of endless responsibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cracks recur to constrain climb and charge closure ("marking the cracked plaster... sealing the leak between eras"); dust, fluorescents, peanut oil integrate tactilely via POV bias, mirroring internal quest without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover ceilings) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ghost-pointed ladder patch narrowing to release with agency (cuts zip tie); cost felt in elevator's "held breath finally released" and ensuing burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of eras leaking via cracks emerges organically, resonant in final reflection ("crowds... before the glass returned to my own tired face") reweighting hidden wonders against solitary duty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust never does") biases noticing toward overlooked traces; rhythmic control modulates from cool observation to peak ("cold dust fell in sheets") without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("hairline cracks... mirrored the fractures"); metaphors coherent and purposeful (shaft "breathing"), varied syntax breathes with scene, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seeing elevator tech uncovering clockwork payroll in circus ruin; risk of supernatural integrated via dust/observance, with mainspring barrel transforming "time he had guarded" inevitably.</comment>
