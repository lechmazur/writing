<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus genuine empathy—act simultaneously in the sensing beats and compel the closure choice to infuse real shame, earning her change with visible cost in writing the brother's name.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds from static sensing to petal infusion, delivering on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Orin's earned tears, Mira's tenderness) with felt emotional cost in the final exhale and boundary payment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's resinous air and seeping pool constrain Mira's honest choice (demands authenticity over fake) and charge the final image of cooled embers sky and internal lantern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (aid Orin's transformation authentically) tightens via agency-driven deepening—Mira's static-revealed insight forces real emotion trade-off—with unmistakable cost in her subsumed shame and retained payment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of counterfeit vs. earned emotion emerges organically from petal infusion and half-truth sensing, offering resonant non-literal answer in closure's "training wheels for something real" reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (static crackles mapping truths, scent embodiment) and rhythmic control heighten pressure through the throat-hover sensing without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density with propulsion (e.g., "static made truth loud" multitasks revelation), varied rhythm, and purposeful figuratives like "scorched orange peel" without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of static-sensing emotion appraisal in amber transformation feels inevitable from early premise, with risk-taking in textural voice heightening stakes organically.</comment>
