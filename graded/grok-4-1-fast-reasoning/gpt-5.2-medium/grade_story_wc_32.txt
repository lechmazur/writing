<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait constrains Mara's steady voice amid admitted fear at climax, earning resolve without softness; Jun's pressure forces micro-choice in collaboration. Interior contradiction embodied in patient filing despite past failures. Final endurance forecloses obedience path with relational cost to Jun.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: incremental reshaping builds to RR closure as crozier cuts seals and pit collapses into glass, reconfiguring destiny with felt fear cost. Orientation anchored early in nexus description. Single scene causality intact, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ember nexus and furnace pit constrain choices (heating, striking) and charge final collapse image. Sensory details (iron, saffron, ember breath) selective via alchemist bias, evolve with action. Spatial choreography clear through rings to center.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interrupt destiny) signaled early, accumulatively tightens via Jun's doubt and controlled fractures narrowing options to new form. Agency in successive choices culminates in use of tool; fear cost legible on walk back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Creative destruction theme emerges from crozier's reshaping, final image of guiding crook reweights obedience without statement. Subtext in "tiny cries of metal" and nexus exhale invites ambiguity on kinder work's viability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with alchemist perceptual signature (listening to metal cries, tinctures as guesses). Dialogue subtextual (Jun's shake vs Mara's direct mold metaphor), advances plot. Rhythmic modulation in process beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures ("ice lit from within") integrated into action; varied syntax propels increments. Minor overwriting density in opening nexus (-0.3), but peak transformation clean, no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical destiny-breaking via crozier crook; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without opacity. Transformation of charter ritual feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
