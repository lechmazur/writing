<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's trait of hearing unspoken words drives motivation and choices consistently, culminating in the mayor confrontation where gentle questioning forecloses shouting as a path with felt relational cost. Contradictory impulses (humble vs. town's volume) act in planning and endgame setup. Students apply secondary pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences, lights, and patterns builds to Charged Poise closure in "council... chose to keep the grove," reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost of erased shade legible in mayor's memory image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via synchronized windows narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto ore constrains signal timing and charges final alignment click; mist/library amplify quiet, mirroring internal rebellion and guiding mayor's entry. Sensory hierarchy (pull of magnets, watery stars) reflects Eli's perceptual bias; spatial choreography clear across cliff-to-street.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save grove via second thoughts) signaled early; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift at "windows flipped at once" deepens pressure, forcing mayor's stance crystallization with visible cost in delayed vote and lingering tree image. Agency in grotto cue and tea offer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of gentle influence emerges via chess/tree motifs shifting from midgame trunk to canopy shelter, offering non-literal answer to "what kind of town" question in final sapling pawn without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "puzzles changed people" reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (unspoken pauses); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet setup to charged dawn ("blossomed with tiny lights"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in mayor scene; no head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (short clicks amid mist cadence); minor figurative density in opener ("swallowing sound... amplified quiet") borders overwriting but integrates without muddle. No loops; propulsion peaks at synchronized flip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Window chessboard forming tree transforms tropes of rebellion/activism into fresh, grounded synthesis; risk of poetic compression pays off in inevitable hindsight via grotto metronome. Non-obvious angle on influence elevates beyond template environmental save.</comment>
