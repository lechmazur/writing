<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in consistent quietude trait, with contradictory impulses (craving hearing without currency) acting in encoding scene; final glyph choice earned by ghost's pour and Lio's laugh, foreclosing loud song with endurance cost. Micro-choices like drilling plate reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from lightning narrow to thunder threat; orientation anchored early (Lio tuning in courtyard); CR closure lands on-page in realization "ghost did not want resurrection; it wanted routing" with conceptual cost of quiet carrier promise, charged by final glyph and readers' echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (storm metal smell, phosphor walls, wet stones) filtered through tinker's priorities constrains graffiti choice at parapet and charges final thunder-shaken mist image; bolt plate micro-setting evolves via sparks to enable reading own code.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (encode ghost needs before mute thunder) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ghost's string tremor and fluttering fear, forcing Lio's plate-strike agency; cost unmistakable in "afraid that once sound returned it would be mute again," reweighting to routing endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of indirect articulation emerges organically from encoding particulars, with final glyph/blossom image offering resonant CR to "wants someone to hear him without turning his voice into currency," reweighting quiet as transmission without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (gear patterns, cloud sea below); rhythmic control modulates from humming lullaby to thunder cadence, heightening pressure without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative texture (moth circling lamp, white script) integrated into action; varied rhythm propels via sentence openings, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image of echoing song.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skyship ghosts, graffiti encoding, cloud cities transforms tropes via tinkersong logic; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens quiet stakes, inevitable in hindsight from bolt plate evolution to routing glyph.</comment>
