<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jun's olfactorily sensitive trait and journaling habit root ambition in concrete traits, driving micro-choices like scent-mapping the wardens' deception and showing her journal to Etsu; contradictory impulses peak during the bloom when knees buckle but she endures via breath-matching sway. Final renunciation of theft for earned service forecloses greedy path with felt cost in ambition's settlement. Voice coherent and particular through sensory bias.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (scents, doodles, sway) builds to closure's Charged Poise in seed-handing and final spiral doodle, reconfiguring wisdom from theft to shared undercurrent with conceptual cost of personal ambition. Orientation anchors early (Jun climbing to Larkroot). One tightening at bloom watch narrows options; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Treetop sway constrains movement ("moving with the treetops' sway"), scents guide forbidden path, corpse bloom charges final realization; sensory hierarchy via Jun's nose filters urgency (sulfur-honey warning to fern-clean thread). Micro-setting (journal paper, branch swing) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Atmosphere's wildflower hush evolves to charged hush post-bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (corpse seed for serenity medicine) signaled early, tightens via Etsu's test forcing endurance of bloom reek, narrowing theft option; agency in journaling observations earns seed, with cost in ambition's reconfiguration felt in descent. Accumulative escalation via scent realizations reweights village's decay-wisdom. Moral calculus between greed and service sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Undercurrent of wisdom emerges implicitly via corpse flower's "ugly ceremony" and Jun's scent-realization of decay as compass, culminating in final spiral doodle ("stink and grace") as non-literal answer reweighting ambition to service without moralizing. Particulars (moths, fern thread, paper spirals) build resonance; ambiguity lingers in shared wisdom's flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable on Jun's perceptual signature (scent signatures like "graves and ripe pears"); diction/rhythm modulate with pressure (tight lines during bloom). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Etsu's "why...famous for stench" tests motive). No head-hopping; voice biases notice toward odors/currents.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "breathed through it, matching her inhale to the branch's swing" advances sensation, endurance, theme); rhythm varies read-aloud, openings diverse. Figurative density purposeful/patterned (spirals, undercurrents) without muddle, though minor elevated diction slips in bloom beat slightly dull propulsion. No loops/artifacts; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scent as wisdom-compass via corpse flower/moths transforms trope of forbidden relic into decay's utility; doodle-maps on paper interiors personalize ambition's arc. Risky lyric compression of bloom pays off in CR; no derivative echoes, fully committed to olfactory world-logic.</comment>
