<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines in embodied psychometry ("pressure... weight of a love story never developed"), with contradictory impulses (burglar thrill vs. seeking love) acting in scene; final delivery act earned by vision mirroring her lyrics loop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from incubation to projection; on-page CR closure ("lyrics... rested, like thunder that has learned to whisper") reconfigures unused love storage with felt cost in ritual completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Booth as "small universe with corridors of air" constrains spatial imagination; projector lamp housing and wall screen charge final projection image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, deepens via Eli vision mirroring Mara's lyrics; agency in threading blank strip and reading aloud forecloses loop with cost (lyrics rest, booth expands).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (stubs, strips, cans as storage); final "deliver" label offers resonant non-literal answer to central question, reweighting rituals without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spatial mapping ("emotions having coordinates"); rhythmic control modulates from velvet rain to sprocket clatter, stable close third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("rain sounded like someone folding velvet") taught early, propels via varied rhythm; no loops, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry on blank film as love vault transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in "deliver" reconfiguration.</comment>
