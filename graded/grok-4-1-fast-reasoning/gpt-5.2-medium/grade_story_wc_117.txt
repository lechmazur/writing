<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of Liora's cautious exuberance via locket curl and brother's spoons memory, driving adaptive choices; Mara's micro-responses earn closure hum without therapy-speak; contradictory grief/love impulses act in eclipse sharing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory buildup to eclipse hush; on-page Charged Poise closure in Mara's hum/whisper ("thin thread at first, then steadier") reconfigures silence with braided grief cost; shards anchored to present cues, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dreaming Roots and eclipse shadows constrain tempo/choices, charging final hum; sensory hierarchy (sage/cold sap, birds uncertain) filters via Liora's priorities; micro-tools (kalimba, curl) evolve tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (link grief via music/wonder) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to eclipse pressure narrowing options; agency in eclipse permission and curl reveal forecloses erasure path with felt braiding cost legible in "grief and love braided, not erased."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically via curl/eclipse/hum particulars, reweighting grief premise in final whistle image without moralizing; invites ambiguity on wonder's scale through ridge's responsive laugh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (music metaphors like "drum like a heartbeat") biases noticing; stable close-3rd on Liora with rhythmic modulation under eclipse stress; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("He used to whistle").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports hush buildup; minor metaphor density in climax ("world clicked into a dim blue hush") borders overwriting but propels without loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh eclipse-grove-curl synthesis transforms grief therapy trope; risk-taking in textural accumulation heightens ridge's "cautious exuberance" without gimmickry.</comment>
