<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional character depth with Mara's colorblind texture focus and cunning (portrait revealing scar) driving earned final trade; Joren's fear of emptiness compels refusal-then-sharing with felt cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene (innocent smile measures bargains). Final renunciation of sour awakenings earned by spiral walk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal trades build accumulatively) holds to Charged Poise closure: reed taken, note vibrates chimes reconfiguring trades as "rooted" with shared awakening cost ("he still remembers it"). Orientation anchored early (courtyard dawn). Single scene causality tightens via rejections to spiral payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Courtyard constrains via plant grammar and flagstone fractures shaping spiral choice; glass chimes charge final image ("every tremor shows... new shade of wrong that feels right"). Sensory hierarchy (ash/resin, cold brass bite) POV-biased to Mara's textures. Evolving details (pots shifted) mirror trades.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reed for beauty in imperfection) signaled early, tightens via three agency-driven escalations (awakening rejected, portrait tempts, spiral forces crystallization); cost legible in Joren's "wilted fern" and final shared starlight altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect trades enriching both emerges organically from colorblind sketches, flawed portrait, bubbles-as-stars; final reed note reweights bartering premise without moral ("choosing trades that leave both... more awake"). No tidy resolution, ambiguity in "honest mistake."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Mara's perceptual signature (misread browns, texture over hues); voice modulates poetically yet concrete ("cold edge bites her palm"). Joren's sparse dialogue ("voice rough from furnace smoke") distinct/subtextual. Rhythmic control peaks in spiral beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short punchy trades amid lyrical images like "map of breath"). Figuratives consistent/voice-led ("cooled tears," "bubbles... stars not flaws"). Propulsion peaks at closure vibration without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phoenix aftermath, plant grammar trades, reed awakening glass transforms tropes; risk in silent bargaining/spiral pays off charging closure. Inevitable hindsight from early rosemary/ivy rules.</comment>
