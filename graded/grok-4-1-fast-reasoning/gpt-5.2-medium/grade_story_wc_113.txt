<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to unravel the ghost's code roots in her inspiration by silence, shown through embodied micro-choices like finger taps and held fermata that compel higher-stakes movement; final shift to guiding others feels earned with visible cost of disrupting fear. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrases. Minor lack of overt internal contradiction acting simultaneously caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of water-revealed maps/music builds density across in-between spaces to ledger discovery; closure as Conceptual Repricing in final image of musicians playing from gaps reconfigures performance premise with conceptual cost of embracing ruin. Orientation anchored early in pit. One tightening via fermata-door suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded opera house with lanterns constrains choices (water develops program, swollen door yields to silence); recurring water/pit/pool subtly mirrors internal hush, filtering through musician's sensory bias. Micro-setting of in-between spaces charges final image. Vivid, selective details propel without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel code via ghost's directions) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pattern-deepening (maps to music to ledger) narrowing options to wordless replies; agency in taps/holding silence forecloses fear-driven inaction with felt cost in ruined performance. Climax door via fermata tightens coherently. Minor swappability in replies prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of music emerging from silence/gaps arises organically from particulars like unstruck chords and in-between notations; final image of dispersed playing offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting performance as building-seam song. Subtext in water's revealing implies disruption's necessity. Counter-readings (fear vs. answer) linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with musician's perceptual signature (hush as breath, taps as droplets); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with intensity, prose as mind under hush. No dialogue to judge. Minor over-elevation in spots edges from 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "river into its ribs" purposeful in accumulative texture, rhythm varies read-aloud. No loops or scaffolds; minor density of figures in opening risks overwrite but integrates without muddle. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water-damage code in flooded theater transforms ghost trope via in-between music logic; risk in wordless ghost dialogue heightens stakes organically. Final arrangement from gaps feels inevitable hindsight. Bold lyric structure pays off.</comment>
