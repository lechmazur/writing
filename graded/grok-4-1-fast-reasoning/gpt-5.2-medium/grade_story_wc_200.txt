<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Mara's shared guilt act simultaneously during Elowen's confession, compelling the tooth hand-off; final endurance integrates her grief with visible emotional cost. Backstory anchors concretely to present plucking and tilts choices without flattening pressure. Mara reads as individual via frog rhyme and godling memory shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density of harp echoes guides from cave to cleft, culminating in laugh reconfiguration; closure Charged Poise lands on-page as bundle dissolves into sunrise-lit mist with grief-integration cost legible in "Mara's own grief laugh softly." Orientation anchored by ~50 words. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting of warped harp constrains initial pluck and echoes multiplying shame; recurring gorge cleft and sliver of light charge final image, evolving causally as laugh gentles echoes. Sensory hierarchy (cold rain whispers, mist beads) reflects Mara's soul-listening urgency. Details tactile and POV-biased without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal soul via laughter) signaled early tightens accumulatively to confession spill and tooth transfer narrowing options; Elowen's shame-choir forces Mara's rhyme agency with legible emotional cost in burning chest. No reversal overload; pressure coheres to stance crystallization. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration pre-cleft caps below 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of laughter cracking calcified grief emerges from particulars like frog rhyme and tooth memory, reweighting Elowen's bundle dissolution without moralizing; final image answers via integrated healing with counter-reading ambiguity in Mara's unresolved wrists. Subtext in silences and warped notes invites reflection. No Thematic Echo or tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in echo-distorted sensations; diction/rhythm modulates from hush to brightening wobble without filter stacks or head-hopping. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Elowen call-out pursues goal). Voice reflects Mara's biased noticing of luminous ache.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "plucked...air filled with luminous ache" advances setting/conflict); rhythm varies read-aloud without loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in gorge echoes (cold rain, choir) purposeful under textural lens but risks coherence in peak confession beat, docking from 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-collecting via misaligned harp laughter transforms ghost tropes organically; risk in lyric gorge echoes heightens stakes to cleft climax without gimmickry. Premise non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight via tooth-godling anchor. Bold tone modulation from ache to integration.</comment>
