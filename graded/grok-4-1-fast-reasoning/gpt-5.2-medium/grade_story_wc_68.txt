<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orin's contradictory dread and longing embodied in stomach knot and shaking arms propel micro-choices like naming silt strata, earning the final rig-building stasis against Mara with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through silt layers mirroring narratives to cog discovery and Mara refusal, landing Charged Poise closure in cog-turning rig with conceptual cost of persistent isolation legible in "damp dark" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silt strata constrain digging choices and charge final cog image; sensory details like "stank of old paper and salt" and "fish swam through windows" filter via Orin's priorities, evolving with pumps and half-drained pools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve methods tightens accumulatively via physical toil in layers and Mara rejection narrowing options to solo rig; agency in endurance forecloses Council assimilation with felt costs like shaking arms and meal ticket refusal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge implicitly from silt-naming lies to cog's measured teeth versus Mara's heroes, reweighting premise in final rig image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in metaphors like "sanding wood" and "sewer water whispering" holds stable third-close POV; sparse dialogue natural with subtext in Mara's "practiced sympathy" advancing refusal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors like "sedimentary layers, layered like history"; no loops, though minor simile thickness in opening doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken philosopher digging narrative layers for cog transforms post-plague tropes into fresh synthesis of history-as-silt, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
