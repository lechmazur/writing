<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's internal conflict shines in the boy-hauling beat, where old instincts clash with emerging empathy, earning the final testimony choice through prior micro-decisions like refusing the wallet. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously under pressure, with embodied wonder as a "bruise you keep pressing." Flawless arc from blankness to jaded humanity without tidy epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Causal) holds: newspaper clues cause journey beats, accumulating to CR closure where testifying reconfigures blank heart with conceptual cost, legible in "empathy can be rebuilt word by word." Orientation anchors early post-procedure; one tightening suffices via escalating choices. Cost undeniable in forfeited new identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains choices by lighting branching passages and mirrors jury-like pressure at climax, charging final image. Sensory details (wet stone, algae, rippling glow) filter through jaded POV, evolving with descent. Newspaper as micro-setting recurs tactilely, guiding tactics without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild empathy vs blank utility) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven turns like boy rescue narrowing to binary climax; cost felt in "lake shimmered like a jury." Accumulative pressure coheres under Hybrid lens, with moral calculus between crimes and humanity. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of choice-forged empathy emerges organically from particulars like quote-placards and ball-toss, culminating in non-literal CR: blankness reweighted by "statement, and a jaded wonder." Subtext in refusals avoids morals; ambiguity lingers in rebuilt humanity's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice distinct with perceptual bias (e.g., "wonder survived like a bruise"), modulating rhythm under stress—short sentences in choices heighten pressure. Time traveler dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, stable distance. Diction/rhythm control exemplary, prose as jaded mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "delicately robust" evokes theme/tactility). Varied rhythm propels via read-aloud ear test; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Zero artifacts dull closure image; precise verbs anchor pivotal toss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Time-traveler baseball + newspaper acrostics synthesize fresh premise on empathy engineering, with labyrinth transforming tropes into choice-crucible. Bold risk in surreal underground pays off via grounded decisions; inevitable hindsight from clues to testimony. Irreplaceable ingenuity elevates stakes.</comment>
