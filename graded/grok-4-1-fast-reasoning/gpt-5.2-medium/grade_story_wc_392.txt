<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of vulnerability and empirical calm act simultaneously, earning the closure choice to upload; embodied fear pulses with lingering palm warmth as visible cost. Father's breath and NDA entangle without unearned epiphany. Final defiance reveals hierarchy of values under Kellan's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lantern touch → memories → evidence discovery → upload as Decisive Change with fear as felt cost in "fear continue to pulse in her, yet it no longer owned her." Orientation anchors in first paragraph. Single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel echoes and dust constrain choices, hiding impact and guiding hidden route; recurring lantern charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (ears over eyes) reflects POV urgency. Post-drought wet brick and humidity prove timing empirically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove preventable narrows via causal discoveries, forcing agency in upload; Kellan's call tests commitment with trade-off of career fear. Escalation driven by protagonist's empirical micro-choices under Causal lens. Cost legible in persisting fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of breaking ownership emerges organically from lantern's past fugitives mirroring Mara's defiance; final "warmth lingered... like a promise passed hand to hand" reweights without moral. Subtext in entangled memories invites ambiguity on control's echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in counting "details like a scientist"; rhythm modulates from calm listing to charged shadows. Kellan's "voice sliding... like oil" carries subtext. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensory, and interiority without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies with short investigative bursts and flowing revelations. Figuratives like "shadows that seemed to carry the fleeing feet" purposeful, not muddled. Propulsion peaks in upload beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad lantern revealing modern corruption transforms ghost-story trope via empirical investigator; risk in memory-entanglement pays off at charged closure. Non-obvious moral calculus on historical freedom vs. career control feels inevitable.</comment>
