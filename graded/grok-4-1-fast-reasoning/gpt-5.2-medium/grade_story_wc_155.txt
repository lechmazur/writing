<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to rediscover joy roots in concrete traits like festival memories resurfacing when face softens; contradictory impulses (pensive mirth while smiling at projections) act in climax painting beat; final open display earned by prior micro-choices like aligning film.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build via moth messages to fragment click and light-painting; closure CR via new self-image on film reconfigures art/memory premise with conceptual cost of sharing process openly; dream pattern taught early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog as screen for projections in climax charges final image; orchard ruins constrain via recess fit and dead trees guide path; artist POV filters details like "walls begging for color," mirroring internal fogged joy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early tightens accumulatively via film alignment deepening to shared projections; agency in threading film forces trade-off of pensiveness for practical rebuilding; cost felt in "only projections" but reweights via display.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared art piercing fog emerges via particulars like moth notes and light silhouettes; final film image of own hand offers non-literal answer reweighting joy as rebuildable lamp without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with artist perceptual signature ("colors clung... dawn clings to dew"); rhythmic prose modulates from pensive to comedic bow; purposeful elision of dream rules taught early, legible at wake.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with images like "fog took on faint shadows" advancing multiple layers; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds; figurative pattern (wool fog, paper moths) coherent, no muddle in peak projection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ruined film projecting lost joy in fog orchard transforms artist trope; risky dream-moths network heightens ingenuity without gimmick; closure image inevitable from light-painting premise.</comment>
