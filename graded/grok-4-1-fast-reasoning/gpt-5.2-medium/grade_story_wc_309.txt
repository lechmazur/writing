<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Davin's motivation to reclaim the sacred through simplicity drives consistent micro-choices like unstrapping the harness and the frost-petal ritual, earning the final renunciation with embodied contradiction (hungry heart vs. trained failures). Interiority feels particular and embodied, avoiding epiphanies. Closing walk past the confused automaton reveals flawed competence without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from city quiet to terrace garden, culminating in Charged Poise RR where simple ritual reconfigures the folly into a "doorway for whoever came with empty hands," with cost in harness discard and mist-trust felt on-page. Orientation anchors early (Davin at output window). No lens ambiguity; pattern pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "spill of river fog" and "frozen roses shaped from hoarfrost" constrain choices (mist walking through imperceptible crack) and charge the final image of deepened luminance. POV bias filters via mage's priorities (sacred vs. measured). Micro-setting (keystone, bench) mirrors internal shift without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (human sacred vs. automation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via automaton whir prompting unstrapping/drift, narrowing options with agency-driven cost (gear clatter, open-air step). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; no coincidence resolution. Moral calculus sharpens peak ritual over theft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacred simplicity vs. automated perfection emerges organically from particulars like perfect charms' uselessness and petal arrangement deepening luminance, offering non-literal resonant answer in "doorway for empty hands." Subtext in silence vs. arithmetic charges closure without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brilliant dimness," halos) biases noticing toward unmeasured light; rhythmic control modulates from blurred vapor to steady candle. Automaton dialogue natural/subtextual (offers prayer, rejected implicitly). Stable close third-person; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (lullaby stairs, laughter in ice) without muddle, varying rhythm accelerates to terrace. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; final image "low, brilliant dimness" recharges motifs. Read-aloud ear confirms natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI automation premise via mist walking and spire impossibilities transforms trope into inevitable ritual renunciation. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes (empty hands vs. machines). No derivative echoes; voice commits boldly to lyric fantasy.</comment>
