<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's calmly intuitive trait drives micro-choices like using mirrors to reveal men's fears, earning the final plan that integrates their dread and shame. Fisherman and glaciologist gain depth via shard/mirror glimpses without head-hopping. Contradictory impulses (Bureau's failed prediction vs. adaptive empathy) act in the reconstitution beat, compelling higher-stakes shared duties.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shard discovery accumulates via mirror glimpses to reconstituted map's RR (Charged Poise), reweighting anomaly as community courage with cost of shared fears into duties. Orientation anchored early (lighthouse orchard, floes). Single scene with clear internal transitions; closure cost legible in "plan turned their private fears into shared duties."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (rope-braced trees, mirror scars, tin of buttons) filter through Mara's priorities, constraining choices (mirrors awaken shard's glimpses). Vintage store micro-setting charges final map projection. Environment mirrors internal states purposefully (shard brightens recognizing fears), evolving with action; orchard apples picked as payoff image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shard resolution to prevent calving disasters) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via anomaly pulse to community sparks, forcing stance crystallization in assigned duties. Agency in reconstitution forecloses isolation with relational cost. Escalation driven by Mara's adaptation under lens; "warmth that did not match...fear" beat narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (empathy mapped to action over prediction) emerges from shard/mirror particulars, reweighting Bureau's failure in final image of trusted map and anomaly. Resonance in "courageous anomaly of people choosing to act," non-literal answer to prediction-care tension. Subtext in silence and glimpses avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in unused courage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV to Mara with perceptual signature (feels quarrels pre-voice, mirror glimpses as gut understanding). Prose texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm (weighted breath phrases build poise). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; diction biased to light/shadow idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "stitched light to shadow" advances plot/character/theme). Rhythm varies (short mirror glimpses vs. flowing reconstitution); no loops, coherent metaphors (pulse of warmth, mirror faces). Propulsion peaks in "spread a chart...stitched," clean syntax under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Accord Bureau shard + mirror empathy-mapping on ice floes transforms prediction tropes into courageous anomaly payoff. Risky poetic compression feels inevitable; lighthouse orchard premise commits fully, heightening stakes via adaptive anomaly.</comment>
