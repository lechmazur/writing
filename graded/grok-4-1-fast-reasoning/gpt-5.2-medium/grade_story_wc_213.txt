<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—wanting quiet warnings vs. Office demand—and final switch is earned by prior microclimate work and village memory, foreclosing loud siren path with felt professional cost. Humble curiosity shown through sensors and notebook, not labels. Interiority concrete and embodied, e.g., checking glue "patient as stone."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of microclimate graphs builds to Charged Poise RR at switch flip, reconfiguring warning from noise to hum with legible cost (dispatcher's crackle). Orientation anchored early in sanctuary climb. Single scene, no shards, closure on-page with "low note rolled... everyone lean in."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices (parapet bolting, belfry splice) and charges final image (hail ticking on slate amid hum). Sensory hierarchy via POV: vapor swirls, humidity drops, glue smell. Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal shift from squall panic to hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (siren test vs. quiet warning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via graphs and zero-hour pressure, narrowing to switch agency with cost (Office defiance explained via numbers). One decisive deepening suffices; dispatcher's demand forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from vane hum enabling hail/prayer hearing, reweighting prior siren critique without statement. Final image (bell as gratitude) offers resonant non-literal answer, charging particulars like village wail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (vapor as script, needles bending). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, e.g., shortening at midnight flip. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Ivo's factory confession advances motive).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short hail-ticking sentences at peak); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Figuratives purposeful/patterned (hush polishing stone), integrated into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-testing with philosophical renunciation transforms tropes; vane innovation and microclimate graphs feel inevitable from curious POV. Risky quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
