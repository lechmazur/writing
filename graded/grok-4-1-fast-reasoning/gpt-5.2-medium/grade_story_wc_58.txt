<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like curling fingers toward projected warmth and traveler's own presence projection, earn the final intimacy with visible relational cost. Contradictory impulses (gentle guiding vs. personal sharing) act simultaneously in the climax scene. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: red thread as compass reconfigures grief into map with felt emotional cost in "my breath stutter." Orientation anchored early (harbor to garden by para 2). Single scene coherence perfect; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's crooked pear tree, black netting, and bench wet with leaf decay constrain intimate contact and charge final image, mirroring internal states through tactile decay. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (perfume, soil ear-pressing). No white-room; micro-setting drives choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explained absence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via projection tightening options—ghost warmth forces queen's lean with relational cost. Agency in traveler's breath-borrowing and voice-guiding forecloses raw wound path. Cost unmistakable in stuttered breath and curled fingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of healing geography emerges organically from particulars (soil-listening, sea corridor), reweighted in final thread image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: departures woven into meaning. Subtext in silences and implications enriches without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (lonesome splendor eyes as wet stones); first-person stable with rhythmic modulation under grief pressure. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (queen's true detail request advances projection). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "palace itself tighten, a loom remembering" advances setting/atmosphere/emotion); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent and purposeful, no muddle in peak projection beat. Propulsion peaks cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituary-for-living via breath-projection transforms grief tropes into geography of healing; red thread's evolution feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully.</comment>
