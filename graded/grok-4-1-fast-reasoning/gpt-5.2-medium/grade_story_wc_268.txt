<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orun's motivation to unmask the pretender roots consistently in his archivist traits, compelling higher-stakes choices like sundering the mosaic; interiority shows through embodied actions under pressure, with regally unpretentious refusal of the crown earning a meaningful renunciation with visible cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits exceptional band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (pellet to rune drift to messages to sundering), delivering on-page Decisive Change at "sundered the star in two" revealing scroll/ledger with collapsing library as felt cost. Orientation anchors immediately in first paragraph; single scene progression tightens seamlessly to charged closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ancient temple library vividly constrains choices (aisles shift via rune, mosaic sunderable only via ink sigil) and charges final collapse image; sensory details like "dust fell in slow arcs like collapsed prayers" filter through Orun's archivist priorities, evolving causally with rune pause.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, escalates via causal deepenings narrowing options (cryptic annotations to sealed chamber); protagonist agency peaks in sundering with library collapse as visible cost reweighting success, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths in libraries vs. forged power emerges organically from particulars like iron gall ledger matching decrees; final refusal of crown offers resonant non-literal answer (archivist over king) reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (library as living rumor-trader); poetic voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, syntax reflecting archivist mind in phrases like "shelves leaning like courtiers bowing out"; no dialogue to judge, but compression legible and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "constellations shifting so slowly that an hour became a season" advances time/plot/atmosphere); zero loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors, varied rhythm survives read-aloud without overwriting in peak sundering beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library quest with rune-drift navigation and collapsing archive as self-erasing truth mechanism feels inevitable; risk-taking in time-pause magic heightens stakes organically, transforming tropes through archivist's unpretentious triumph.</comment>
