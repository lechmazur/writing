<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's internal conflict—fear of inheriting arson shown in embodied scar and hesitation at boy's face—earns final coin-leaving choice with vulnerability cost. Contradictory compassion drives micro-choices like disobeying radio amid flames. Secondary characters (boy, sister) pressure via rescue parallel to family legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (sand, coin, lagoon) builds to CR closure where leaving coin reconfigures legacy with exposure cost, on-page legible. Orientation anchored early (boardwalk, beach). Backstory shards (<20%) cue present stakes without flattening; one tightening via graft-investigator link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Black sand constrains (moisture test, engine sink) and charges final image (absorb stories); obsidian lagoon/kelp contrasts fire chaos, mirroring compassion. Sensory hierarchy firefighter-specific (kerosene smell, tremors). Evolving details (calm post-blaze) integrate via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compassion proving scars sing) signaled early, tightens via graft agency under beam (forecloses easy exit) and coin copy deepens to renunciation. Costs visible (burn risk, vulnerability). Escalation accumulates density to Charged Poise at dusk return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (answer burning with saving) emerges implicitly from graft, scar talk, coin copy; final leaving reweights inheritance non-literally via light-grafting image. Subtext in kelp peace vs. flames; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature: firefighter lens (read smoke/gusts) biases noticing. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (girl's scream-to-grip, "scars sing"). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity without head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel (e.g., "scooped...slide through glove"); purposeful metaphors (flames chew rafters) in pressure without muddle. Minor paraphrase in reflections (compassion reps) but no loops touching closure; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: field graft + coin copycat transforms arson legacy trope into compassion proof. Ingenuity in "scars sing" via sand grains; risk of gruesome medicine detail heightens stakes organically.</comment>
