<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sen's rejection of the bottle's temptation shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, embodied in pressing palm to glass then forcing attention to dyes; final charter proposal is earned by prior soap trades and memory work with visible cost of foreclosing wishes. Interiority particular via academy backstory anchoring present choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from soap success to town revival; Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page in "revival was the only opening it ever needed," reweighting wishes-to-making with conceptual cost of lost miracles. Orientation anchored early in cove description; shards taught by patterns of returnees.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bottle and lanterns constrain choices (hanging lanterns for soap, bottle's throb decoded via memory) and charge final council image; sensory details like "salt rotted beams" and "coin gleamed" filter through Sen's alchemist priorities, evolving with revival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild via work vs. wish temptation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when returnees demand bottle-opening but Sen rejects, forcing charter; agency in proposing "grandchildren judging them" forecloses easy path with social cost legible in month-of-new-tides image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-making over miracles emerges organically from bottle realization and charter; final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing, cost in "compressed recollection... by being remembered."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in alchemical details like "salt crystallized cleanly"; rhythmic control modulates from quiet arrival to charged pulses; sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven (woman's trade for lanterns).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with lines like "shops sagged, shrine steps cracked" advancing atmosphere and action; varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts; precise diction like "lye and fish oil" propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical revival in wish-economy ghost town, with bottle as memory vessel transforming tropes; risk in accumulative revival pattern heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via coin-sparked plan.</comment>
