<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Galens zen potter traits compel choices like handling the lantern with sharp gentleness, earning the final alignment; contradictory impulses in understanding vs. not breaking fuse in the chimney rotation. Sera applies pressure via her fear of wrong-hour stranding, forcing his promise. Voice distinct in sparse dialogue; flaws like Sera's hatred add moral ambiguity without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as lantern thrum accumulates density through footprints, shadows, Sera, to chimney closure; Resonant Reconfiguration lands when overlaps narrow and combs crumble, with legible cost in lost stasis. Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene causality tight, no ambiguity at end. Cost proof: "preserved combs crumbled into honest dust."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via sun patterns on bricks enabling climax rotation; vivid sensory integration (thrum, wax scent, brackish spring) filters through potters priorities (hives as kilns). Atmosphere tensions stasis vs. change; spatial choreography clear in apiary walk. Final image charges with smoke lifting, environment reconfigured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand resistance tightens via fractured discoveries narrowing to timeline choice; agency in offering water and lantern rotation forecloses stasis with cost (crumbling combs). Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload; Seras hatred braids internal/external. Cost unmistakable in springs clearing after refusal to grab.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resistance as stacked refuge emerges organically from lantern responses and timeline glimpses, reweighted non-literally in gentle centering. Final image answers via chosen timeline with care, charging prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in Seras hum vs. cracked lips adds ambiguity; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with potters perceptual signature (clay/centering metaphors); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to taut in climax. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Seras oasis hate forces promise); no head-hopping, diction biased to tactile/zen idiom. Under stress, compression heightens thrum urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "lantern thrum matched the shimmer"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (timelines as stacked bowls). Propulsion syncs with beats; zero figurative muddle in peak lantern rotation. Read-aloud ear perfect, no overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-fracture wasteland via beekeeping oasis storing selves like kiln bowls; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in gentle repricing. No template echoes; ingenuity in lantern as timeline-centering tool inevitable in hindsight. Bold tone transforms post-apoc tropes organically.</comment>
