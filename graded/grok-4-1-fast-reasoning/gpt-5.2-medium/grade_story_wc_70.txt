<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maro's involuntary truthfulness compels pivotal choices like rebuking Sela and opening the box with confession, earning the final legend shift; contradictory impulses between old lies and raw candor act in scene with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds tightly—riddle to tower to truth-unsealed box—with on-page RR closure as queen core pulses and routes paint walls, reconfiguring blackout premise; cost legible in published fault and personal admissions; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring objects like scorched drone, thunder nets, and sap seal constrain choices (palm strike, revival); sensory hierarchy sharpens via toll keeper's bias; tower jars "glimmer like trapped fireflies" charge final image without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive wonder/truth amid failure) signaled early, tightens causally at confession narrowing options to public fault; agency in Maro's reveal forecloses lies with relational cost to Sela; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth transmuting disaster emerges implicitly via bees/thunder motifs shifting from cascade to honey; final non-literal image—"truth...can make honey of thunder"—reweights premise with conceptual cost of exposed greed, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (wonder-hungry candor) biases noticing, stable without leakage; dialogue natural/subtextual—Sela's laugh at insult advances pressure; rhythm modulates poetically under stress, diction lexicon-fit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud without monotony; minor figurative density ("eyes flat as coins") in opening risks slight overload but integrates without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone bees, truth-sealed tech, and eco-confession transforms tropes organically; risk in poetic sci-fi voice heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via riddle-box causality.</comment>
