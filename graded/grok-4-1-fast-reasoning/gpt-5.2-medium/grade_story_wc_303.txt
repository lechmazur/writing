<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the coffee stain reading pitting duty against plant warnings; final blank report earned by causal buildup of green murmurs and root terror, with embodied cost in "holes punched through my own life." Sorell applies pressure via confession. Voice particularizes via plant sensations over stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: touch violin → plant murmurs → coffee stains → vent map → smuggling DC with cost in signed indeterminate report and soldier future. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Charged Poise reconfigures empire's claim via alley melody.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: violet velvet muffles footsteps, constraining stealthy hatch slide; ice violin catches starlight, charging final melody image. Midsummer heat tensions glacier relic. Plants as micro-setting enable vent escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream vs. empire/orchards) signaled early, tightens via figs' burned roots image forcing vent action; agency in rope slide forecloses certification path with report cost. Causal escalation narrows options under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perforated destiny emerges via leaks in warnings/stains, resolved non-literally by melody "bright as sap" reweighting imperial ownership. Small green loyalties contrast policy without moralizing. Final image answers dream-weighing via propagation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "green murmurs" and sap sensations biases noticing; stable first-person distance modulates poetically under envoy stress. Minimal dialogue natural, Sorell's confession goal-driven. Rhythmic control peaks in vent slide.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines like "destiny here was perforated, full of little holes where choices leaked through" advance theme/causality without loops. Varied rhythm, no artifacts; read-aloud propulsion fits lyric texture, metaphors coherent (e.g., crown blot split).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, natural glacier violin, provenance impossibility transforms relic trope; risk in bureaucratic truth-telling heightens stakes to melody reconfiguration. No template echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
