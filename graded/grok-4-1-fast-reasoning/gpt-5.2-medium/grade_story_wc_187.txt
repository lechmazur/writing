<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly as nostalgia for self wars with duty during measurements, earning the climax choice to write personal memories despite identity dilution; embodied sensations like "stranger's childhood pressed against my ribs" ground interiority without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of merged memories builds to Charged Poise closure when writing own memories steadies fog, with legible cost in "identity shift, not erased but widened"; orientation anchors early via archivist role and terrace; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Solid fog and monuments constrain conjectural shadow-tracing, charging final net of shadows that "steadied the fog"; sensory hierarchy (murmurs to wheat smell) reflects archivist priorities; weather pressures choices as thunder threatens collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving collective memory escalates accumulatively from shard retrievals to storm rise forcing risky final conjecture; agency in measurements narrows options, with cost crystallized in identity reconfiguration under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared memory as architecture emerges organically from mergings to final amplification, reweighting individual nostalgia in resonant image of "sculpted... shape that could hold others" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of sensory braiding and preemptory nostalgia drives distinct voice; rhythmic control modulates from hushed deepening to stormlit reverence, stable first-person with no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "lightning stitched the cloudbank below"; figurative density fits taught lyric pattern without muddle, though minor metaphor layering in peak storm risks slight opacity; zero loops, varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of solid fog, shadow-year glyphs, and memory-weaving transforms collective archive trope into inevitable architecture; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes via conjectural peril without gimmickry.</comment>
