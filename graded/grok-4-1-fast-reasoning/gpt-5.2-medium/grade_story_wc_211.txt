<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Erem's motivation to archive emotional patterns intensifies compellingly from personal reflex to city-saving action, with embodied terror ("terrified that by listening he has sworn the city") showing contradictory impulses acting in the playback beat. Interiority particular via Akkadian/Latin speech warming his chest; final storage choice earned with unease cost. Blind spots (oath-binding via listening) drive mistake then renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wax playback density breaks pattern to reveal prophecy, deepening to loophole in grief peaks, culminating in CR closure ("soft unease of saved lives") with conceptual cost of feeling as truest contract. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (Erem, tower orchard, dusk). Single scene causality tight; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard micro-setting (gnarled trees, glass windbreaks, dark soil) constrains immersion choice and charges final cedar box image, sensory hierarchy via Erem's priorities (silence depth for playback). Details tactile/eavesdropping leaves mirror internal disquiet; evolves with dusk gathering. Recurrent stone table/stylus grounds choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive city's feelings) tightens via prophecy deepening ("exact hour the western power grid will fail"), forcing agency in loophole broadcast; grid falters but crews ready shows earned reversal with city-scale cost foreclosed. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; moral calculus (ignorance feeds grief) visible in patterns written "fear, tenderness, resolve".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of vows as emotional refusal emerges organically from wax grief → archived warning, final image ("record of feeling, because in every language... what we refuse") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting signatures vs. feeling. Subtext in prophecy bruise/lullaby; ambiguity lingers in unease without tidy moral. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (dead languages as reflex, sap/bark metaphors); rhythmic modulation peaks in playback rasp braiding scents. Compression purposeful in orchard immersion; diction controlled, prose as Erem's vow-poetic mind. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tremble in his bag" advances prop/emotion); rhythm varies, openings diverse. Minor figurative density in orchard ("velvet disquiet... trees eavesdropping") risks overwrite but pattern-taught and legible at closure; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dulling playback peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax phonograph as grief-prophecy archive transforms oath trope via emotional patterns/loophole; risk in dead-language broadcast averting grid failure feels inevitable from Erem's traits. No derivative echoes; bold skyscraper orchard/heartbeat wax particularizes urban sorrow.</comment>
