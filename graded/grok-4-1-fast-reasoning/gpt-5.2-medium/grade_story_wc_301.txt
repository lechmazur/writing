<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene—shaking hands trace map yet play accordion for steadiness—and final report-sending renunciation is earned via interleaved guilt cues like the corroded latch, with embodied cost in "the act does not bring my brother back."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density and graffiti discovery tighten to Charged Poise closure in photographing/sending report and final notebook line, with legible conceptual cost: truth as "shelter" reconfiguring guilt's ongoing "route"; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy threads ticket windows and scrapes sleeves as recurring constraint guiding to tunnel/bathroom, charging final platform image; sensory details like rust/wet leaves and silt-buried latch mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant self-forgiveness stake signaled early deepens via graffiti grid-match narrowing to latch discovery, forcing agency in photographing/sending with on-page cost: prevents future drownings but accepts irreplaceable loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-forgiveness route emerges organically from graffiti "START WHERE YOU LIED" and final lullaby image reweighting prior dam-lie without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in endless "surveying."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with chronicler-specific perceptual bias (e.g., "chronicler of currents," "ledger") modulates rhythm under unmedicated stress; stable intimacy heightens embodied guilt without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and tactile images like "bellows patched with tape"; no loops or scaffolds, purposeful figuratives (river "living here too") enhance without muddling peak latch reveal.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Graffiti-as-pivotal-wisdom in derelict station transforms guilt trope via chronicler's methodical lens; fresh synthesis of map/accordion/memory feels inevitable, risking lyric accumulation over plot fireworks.</comment>
