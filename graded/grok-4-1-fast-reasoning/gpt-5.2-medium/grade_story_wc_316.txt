<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via post-ego-death clarity that reveals pretenses in Custodians and Council, embodied in "chest felt like an empty drum"; contradictory numbness drives micro-choices like bowing to clone as sibling, earning final shared-breath reconfiguration with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of rewrites building to RR (Charged Poise in aligned pulses and shudder); one tightening via refusal met with push-pull art forces closure with conceptual cost of surrendered ownership; orientation anchored instantly in dojo/sea/rewrites.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo and edge into cloud constrain trial choreography and risk; wind bells' two tones recur to charge opposites theme, mirroring internal alignment in final shared breath; sensory hierarchy (two-tone ring, ash sea) biases through post-ego POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (personhood/numbness) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via jar's arrival forcing trial; protagonist agency in palm-on-jar pulse and push-pull narrows ownership options with legible cost (numbness crack, faction surrender); single tightening coheres pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites emerges organically from lesson to climax without statement, reweighting custody in final charter/image of shudder from attention; resonant non-literal answer in "custody of the moment" lingers via particulars, inviting ambiguity on originals vs. rewrites.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature ("slices through pretense") biases noticing dual pulses and pretenses; rhythmic modulation accelerates in intervention ("push and pull, where one hand protects and the other risks"); purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with lines like "two tones at once" doing sensory/ thematic work; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density ("blade parts fog") coherent and pattern-taught, supporting peak breath-sharing without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rewrites/dojo/clone-jar transforms custody trope via opposites method, with risk-taking in history-flicker texture heightening stakes; final co-guardians charter feels inevitable from seeded particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
