<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sava's motivation to graft via creation compels high-stakes weave at arbor; interior ache embodied in reed spirals and loneliness addressed, with bold offer revealing contradictory outsider impulses under suspicion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as search density builds to arbor revelation (RR/Charged Poise); closure reconfigures belonging with conceptual cost in kin-map extension, pivotal tag discovery tightening options on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain search choreography and charge dedication image; sensory facets (ringing fruit, rain-on-stone smell) filter through Sava's reed-biased POV, evolving causally to link trees.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging tightens via tag find and map realization under accumulative lens; agency in weave forecloses isolation with felt relational cost, though early rumor lacks one micro-deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of crafted belonging emerges from kin-map and reed lattice without statement; final reeds-with-tag image resonantly reweights invitation motif, inviting ambiguity on mortal signs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (fen-rooted noticing of reeds in glass) with rhythmic modulation; sparse dialogue subtextual (Ilya's tease, Sava's retort), distinguishing voices without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density weaves action-imagery (e.g., "craterlight bled through obsidian like dim stars trapped under skin"); purposeful metaphors support textural lens without muddle, varied rhythm propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reed-crystal world transforms outsider trope via tag-as-invitation; risky poetic compression inevitable in arbor payoff, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
