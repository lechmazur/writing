<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evin's brittle devotion acts in contradictory impulses—wavering at steward's laugh yet timing breath precisely between drips—earning closure endurance as scale settles with felt splintering cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: drip measurement builds density to timed ring and sea tilt reconfiguration, with cosmic ledger premise reweighted by silver ripple promise carrying devotion's cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basin drip constrains rebuild timing between thirteenth-fourteenth drop and charges closure as viaduct stones brighten, ripple writes tide line.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to right imbalance tightens via lukewarm spell and steward doubt, forcing endurance agency to ring; cost legible in wavering devotion foreclosing easy cynicism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mechanical universe theme reweighted non-literally by ripple promise over thunder, resonating naive ledger premise without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward rhythms ("drips on, indifferent") with stable close-third POV; sparse dialogue natural, steward's laugh carrying subtext pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in lines like "breath fogs the seam... soft click" propels without loops or muddle; metaphors cohere (scale trembling) in peak rebuild/ring beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Naive mage fixing cosmos via drip-timed bell transforms trope organically; risk in plausible subtlety heightens stakes to charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
