<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied "spongey dread" and "nervously confident" traits drive micro-choices like steady hands on journal and nail confrontation; internal conflict between doubt and resolve earns final honoring act with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from journal parsing to cemetery nail to annex unlock holds tightly; CR closure via document copy and correction request reconfigures legacy with felt dread drainage legible in dawn image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jet stream rain "soaks straight into thought" and radar dome constrain parsing/climb; fog-haloed lights and cliff cemetery charge final dome vigil, mirroring internal states through tactile fog and rust air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ancestor honor tightens via nail-forced revelation; protagonist agency in climb/confrontation narrows deserter myth, with dread cost unmistakable in "swelling with cold water."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile/memory emerges from particulars like vellum orders; final "sky that... had room for Elias Kline's name" offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with librarian perceptual signature ("parse... like coastlines"); lyrical rhythm ("wind drummed wetly") modulates pressure, dialogue sparse but subtextual in Sato's watchfulness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density in lines like "half-sunk coffin lid under lichened stones"; varied rhythm propels without loops or muddled metaphors, clarity intact at annex exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Reversible Exile" premise synthesizes weather shift, coded journals, and nail-key ingeniously; risk in poetic compression heightens memory stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
