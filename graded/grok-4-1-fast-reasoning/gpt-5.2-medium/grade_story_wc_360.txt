<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kestrel's contradictory impulses—borrowing personalities for business while they erode her coherence—embody internal conflict, culminating in earned final centering with visible cost to self; micro-choices like fitting halo into forme reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup of experiments and vanishings to CR closure in blank broadside print, reweighting empathy with coherence cost legible in "copies run too long"; orientation anchored early, no shards violation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Topaz dust turning halo honey gold and thinning starlight constrain printing choices and mirror erasure motif, charging final stars' reappearance; sensory hierarchy via Kestrel's professional lens integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotion arithmetic tightens accumulatively via transfer costs multiplying selves, forcing final self-print renunciation; agency in halo experiments drives deepening with on-page coherence price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as transformation emerges organically from swap mechanics and ratios, final image of aligned sorrows offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in typesetting metaphors ("misregistered prints," "typeset and erased") modulates rhythm under stress; stranger dialogue natural/subtextual in fear-snap moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (printing/emotion math) propels without loops or muddle; rhythm varies read-aloud, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh halo-as-vector premise synthesizes letterpress fabulism into inevitable emotional math, risking lucid turbulence payoff that heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
