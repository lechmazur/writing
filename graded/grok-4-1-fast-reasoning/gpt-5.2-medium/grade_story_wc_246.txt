<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's "confidently uncertain" trait embodies contradictory impulses in preferring dry pen while scoring grooves; loosens certainty to trace/edit courier link, earning unbend with embodied resistance as memory cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: anomaly tightens → vine-like cadence evokes seeds → contingent edit clicks softly → cadence softens, stars shift, blank signature reconfigures history as passable draft with contingency cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bent nib resists like hooked thorn, constrains unbend mirroring internal certainty; anomaly compresses lights to blue thread, bends chirps purposefully selective via interpreter bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vine cadence deepens stake by linking to seeds/courier discouragement; agency in inserting tea moment forecloses brute edits, reweighting with universe click and nib resistance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final pulse of shared lesson reweights contingency as strange comfort; signals thresh seed/husk without moral, garden scars persist as draft's shaping pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature: "firm clauses while leaving room for the sky to contradict"; rhythmic modulation builds from chirps to wet scratch without head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dense propulsion: "dry pen scratched a line that looked almost wet" varies rhythm, integrates action/metaphor without loops or muddle in peak unbend beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms history-editing via anomaly signals/contingent nodes; courier tea insertion risks modest kindness over decree, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
