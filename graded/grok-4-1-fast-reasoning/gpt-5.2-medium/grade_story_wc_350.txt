<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's "empathetically decisive" trait drives pivotal micro-choices, like feeling the elevator's anger yet making a "tender, vigorous decision" to repurpose it, earning the communal unification with visible social cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via her solo empathy shifting to conducted labor. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding labels; final endurance of night toil forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo tube dialogue to choral repair, tightening via bell-ringing pattern that reconfigures divisions. Closure as Charged Poise in final image—"bridges had begun"—reweights premise with felt cost of pre-dawn labor. Orientation anchored early ("astronomical clock tower... valley silos"); one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring weight and tube constrain choices (counterbalance, voice conduit) and charge final image ("hung the cuckoo clock weight back... proof that counterweights could move whole structures"). Sensory hierarchy choral-specific: creaks as "sentences," grain dust as "incense." Setting evolves tactilely with action, mirroring internal bridges via sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rehabilitate Nine to bridge silos—tightens accumulatively via elevator's demolition reveal forcing granary pivot, narrowing to pre-sunrise agency. Crowd unification tests via language commands ("lift, arriba, hoch"), with visible cost in shaking knees steadied by chord. Escalation driven by her decisions under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sound-built bridges emerges organically from interspersed languages enabling elevator dialogue and crowd melt, reweighting silos metaphor without statement. Final image answers "lonely grammar asking to be answered" via repaired note and busy listening, with ambiguity in ongoing work. Resonance from particulars like tube's "rasping baritone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature—sounds as "braided" languages, "cadence"—modulates rhythmically with intensity, stable single POV. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("We hear you, te escuchamos"), distinguishing her choral idiom. No head-hopping; diction reflects librarian's musical lexicon consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task (e.g., "fastened the cuckoo clock weight... counterbalance the tower's ancient speaking tube"). Varied rhythm suits read-aloud, but minor figurative density in opener ("hush of borrowed starlight") borders overwrite without obscuring closure. Zero loops; clean grammar, strong verbs propel to dawn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: choral librarian animates grain elevators via grandfather's tube and cuckoo weight, transforming "silo" metaphor into literal/public granary. Risky acoustic personification yields inevitable communal reconfiguration. No tropes unearned; premise bold, particular details irreplaceable.</comment>
