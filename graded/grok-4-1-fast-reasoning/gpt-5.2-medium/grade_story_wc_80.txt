<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in calm face masking sensitivity during Beran confrontation, earning final endurance of placing "I am still listening" note despite pursuit; contradictory impulses act in pivots and shoves under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from measurements to silt-cloud escape; Charged Poise closure reconfigures dream's survival ("cannot recover her mother, but she can chart the spaces") with legible conceptual cost in final image of warm inkwell.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains navigation (threading posts, silt boiling hides escape), charging final surfacing; recurring lantern/weed/tiles integrate tactilely into choices without static lists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of mapping absence deepens via Beran incursion forcing tactical shove into pillar; agency in wresting hook and wedging note narrows options with physical cost (muscles shaking, wet sleeves).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interlaced absence emerges organically through mask reflection and note-sealing, reweighting premise in "dream stays alive" without moralizing; final image answers persistence amid loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("pillars lean like tired dancers"); rhythmic modulation peaks in confrontation without filter stacks or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "silt boiling up like smoke" multi-job line); zero loops, varied syntax accelerates to closure unmarred by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion/notes-in-mortar premise synthesizes loss archeology freshly; risk of poetic immersion pays off in charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
