<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain—photo summons pulses leading to Eli's stairwell call—holds through single scene, landing Charged Poise closure when voice fades after Mara's naming, with legible emotional cost in her revision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hearing aid as micro-setting constrains every tracing choice, charging final image of its "warm, steady beat"; misted atrium and stairwell light filter through Mara's perceptual urgency.</comment>
