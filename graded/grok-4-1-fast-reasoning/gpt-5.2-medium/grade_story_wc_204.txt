<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (likes perfect system but distrusts its seams) act in scene via micro-choices like reading frost proofs and carrying whisper; final rupture choice earned by intensifying motivation to hold Mara with visible cost to the catalog. Interiority concrete and particular through glyph spacing and vial alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from grid-to-spiral frost pattern break to closure's Charged Poise in "Mara stepping back onto the balcony," reconfiguring negotiations with undeniable conceptual cost to stability on the page. Orientation anchored early in glass orchard; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Glass orchard constrains choices (follows spiral to thin-bark tree, braces press) and charges final inner-surface image; sensory hierarchy (frost lattices, ink scent, glass creak) reflects Lio's proof-reading priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt slipping contracts to hold Mara) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative lens through frost spiral tightening options to rupture; agency in lever-pull forecloses perfection path with legible cost in shuddering agreements and reordering books.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of eternity-vs-negotiation emerges organically from particulars like bottled whisper and frost glyphs; final mirror image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct surreal perceptual signature (frost as proofs, shelves inhaling); rhythmic diction modulates with pressure, compressing at climax ("glass creaked") without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (e.g., "click of the rollers" advances destabilization) with zero loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful in peak ("hammer" on definitions), passing read-aloud ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal printing/reality into inevitable rupture; bold risk in glass orchard premise transforms tropes, heightening stakes via irreplaceable whisper-press fusion at closure.</comment>
