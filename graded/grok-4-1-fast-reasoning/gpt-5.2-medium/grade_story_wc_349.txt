<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied recognition at "the hole where the title should be matched the hollow in me" drives incisive choice with visible cost; minor abstract phrasing in "mindfully scattered" diagnostic label doesn't flatten peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragment density builds to RR closure in "fragments trembled, then snapped into a single page"; cost legible in self-freedom reconfiguring blank past, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass orchard details like "shelves drifted like rafts" constrain gathering and charge final doorway incision; body/table over sky mirrors internal hollow effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find story beginnings tightens accumulatively via quantifying task, shaking hands embodiment cost at recognition; single deepening suffices but lacks micro-turn agency spike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of blankness-to-beginning emerges organically from ledger sales to self-parole, resonant non-literal answer in margin address reweights prior erasures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of "cloud vortices beneath the floor" and photon-speech sustains under pressure; Mira's brief dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in peak incision ("pressed its tip into nothing"); minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "speech broken into photons" risks coherence without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of vendor incising own origin via quantified absence feels inevitable; bold glass orchard premise transformed through lived blankness without gimmickry.</comment>
