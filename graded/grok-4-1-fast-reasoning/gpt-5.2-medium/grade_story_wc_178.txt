<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between empiricism and faith act vividly in decoding the tile and snapping the stylus; final renunciation of certainty earned by prior verifications. Frugality embodied in reusing tablets and accepting the tile drives micro-choices. No safety-hedging; flaw of conserved certainty complicates and resolves with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations and schematics builds to CR closure via stylus snap ("snapped it in two, laying the halves"), with conceptual cost legible in palm constellations. Orientation anchored early (Nabu-iddin in palace between regimes). One tightening via Mars alignment suffices; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reimagined palace (glass roofs, baked-brick arches, bricked stairwell) constrains choices, e.g., tile fits "square depression in the plaster" to open stairs. Chamber's "metal lines like circuit traces" charges myth-to-map shift. Sensory selective via astronomer's priorities (gnomon, sighting tube).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empirical certainty vs. devotion) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through tile vow and mask reveal, culminating in agency-driven renunciation with on-page cost (stylus breakage alters devotion). Pressure coheres to charged poise; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted devotion to unknown emerges organically via tile sequence and covenant seal; final palms ("new constellations drawn as schematic representations across his own palms") reweights empirical irony without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in schematic motifs and astronomical precision; rhythmic control modulates from dusky observation to chamber intensity. Stable third-limited POV; elision of voice (e.g., mason's brief swear) purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frugal by habit and by grief, counting copper nails and also counting nights"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts. Propulsion aligns with beats; zero figurative muddle in peak (mask reveal).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian astronomy, magic square cryptography, and sci-fi covenant; tile vow-to-mask progression feels inevitable from schematics. Risky reimagined palace/myth-circuit transform heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
