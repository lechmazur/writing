<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in Mara's professional skepticism yielding to anchored intervention at badge reveal and arrowhead planting; motivations intensify credibly from research to complicity. Jonas's bitterness-to-joke arc shows embodied contradiction without tidy resolution. Minor flaw: Edda's wisdom verges stock in nodal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via confessions and gravitational tugs to Charged Poise closure: arrowhead nailing settles chaos with Jonas's punchline refusal, cost legible in his ordinary sweat. Orientation anchored early in Larkspur/town/garden. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Underground garden's glowing herbs and iron-honey air constrain climax choice (luring/planting) and charge final settled gravity image. Sensory hierarchy (taste of grief, humming arrowhead) reflects Mara's researcher bias. Micro-setting (arrowhead, phone) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor Jonas from Choir) signaled early, tightens via Edda's plea and lure to agency-driven climax refusal; cost in foreclosed metamorphosis felt on-page. Escalation via textural density (pots lifting, shadow peeling) under Accumulative lens. Protagonist decisions shape peak without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of anchored refusal vs. untamed pull emerges from particulars (bitter laugh reaching mouth, Choir's harmony folding); final punchline image reconfigures bitterness without moralizing. Subtext in silences (Edda nods, Jonas crouches) invites ambiguity. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (frost in lungs, ribs tugged) stable, modulates rhythmically under stress; dialogue sparse but subtextual (Jonas's dare, Edda's stitch metaphor). No head-hopping or distance slips. Voice texture particular to undercover researcher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "eyes like river ice and a laugh that never reached his mouth"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., gravity "hiccuped like a mischievous child") during peak without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid lore with gravitational/song Choir and arrowhead anchor transforms tropes organically; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration (jokes refuse disappearance) inevitable from priors. Bold voice commits to premise.</comment>
