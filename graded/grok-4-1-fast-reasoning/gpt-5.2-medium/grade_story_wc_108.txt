<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "hands wanted to recoil... but the shell whispered, Listen to the hurt," driving adaptive micro-choices; final tears and hand-holding earn transformation with vulnerability's cost fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain from vault discovery to library decryption to soundstage DC holds tightly; closure's seashell confession and crew turn deliver legible cost in exposed vulnerability, with two-shard structure coherent under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted library's iron shelves and catalog cards constrain decryption choice; stars leaking through roof charge the rubbing scene, mirroring internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival via vulnerability tightens causally through boy's cast to projected notes; protagonist agency in trembling confrontation forecloses silence path with crew's turn as visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cast-notes rubbing and shell-confession synthesize stunt-world betrayal into fresh vulnerability pivot; risk of poetic compression pays off in crew reversal without gimmickry.</comment>
