<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through probabilistic lens and embodied grief like "clover melancholy"; contradictory impulses in theoretically rebellious obedience drive micro-choices like following the map. Final renunciation of inheritance earned via traversals, with visible cost in empty palms. No diagnostic speak; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from map to photos to final scrawl, reweighting stake with Conceptual Repricing in exhibit and hospital talk. Orientation anchored early in rainwashed library post-heart attack. Mosaic shards taught by map-tree; closure cost legible in "best bet was learning to stop."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lantern mica pane as micro-setting constrains choices in storm (flickering power) and charges final image of trembling flame in shared light. Sensory hierarchy: wet stone/clover reflects grief, narrowing under urgency. Spatial choreography coherent across traversals; rain evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand without inheriting) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via contradictions like "IF YOU CAN PREDICT YOUR LOSS, WHY DO YOU STILL PAY," narrowing options to exhibit/renunciation. Agency in traversals forecloses relapse path; cost felt in "palms empty at last."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions emerges from scrawls/notes, reweighted non-literally in clover doodle among weeds and final green grief holding sorrow. Protagonist arc inextricable; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "make room for another day."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: coin/clover metaphors bias noticing cryptic scrawls as data/confession. Lyrical compression taught early via lantern grain, stable first-person distance modulates rhythm under grief. No head-hopping; syntax reflects bruised luck.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "light should have a visible grain" advances voice/setting/stakes). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (layered amber). Propulsion breathes with traversals, closure image sharp.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subway scrawls as professor-gambler's field notes transform addiction trope into traversable lesson. Mosaic map-tree risks bold structure, heightens stakes via odds-forks. Inevitable hindsight in clover among weeds.</comment>
