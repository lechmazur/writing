<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief as unmapped continent vs. promise to navigate) act in scene via skin-reading bark and stone, earning final endurance at pool with embodied cost of facing brother's panic. Interiority particular (tremors, scents); micro-choices reveal values hierarchy. No diagnostic speak; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sensory absorptions to RR closure ("you can miss him and still live") at pool with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early (market to forest). Single scene, one tightening (observatory stone revelation narrows to lullaby resolution). Cost legible in ring's bite and steadier grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest constrains choices (air-currents on cheeks guide steps; vibrations pressure hearing). Body/ring as micro-setting charges final image (ring clicks to stillness). Sensory hierarchy blind-POV specific (scent/memory over sight); details evolve causally (choir softens at pause).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stillpoint for grief steadiness) signaled early; textural deepening via stone's heartbeat-grammar forces confrontation, foreclosing avoidance with pool-cost realization. Agency in dowsing/endurance; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (internal navigation of grief) emerges from particulars (skin languages to pool sentence); final image reweights premise non-literally without moral. Resonance from brother's preserved panic mirroring emotional depths; ambiguity lingers in "no borders, only currents."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind perceptual signature (palms absorb, cheeks read currents) distinct; rhythmic control modulates to hushed silence at clearing. Stable close third-person; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No elision debt; prose as character reflects cartographer's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density (each line layers sensory/advances texture); rhythm varies (short hums crescendo to silence). Figurative pattern (blaze, choir) taught/purposeful, no muddle in peak (pool touch). Zero loops; propulsion peaks at "every language... one plain sentence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: skin-languages + ultrasonic choir transform grief trope into sensory quest; risk of lyric density heightens stakes (competence via tremor/scent). Stillpoint reconfigures navigation rule-set inevitably from vellum-burning intro.</comment>
