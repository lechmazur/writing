<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sel's motivation to free stardust roots in consistent traits like hearing unspoken words, intensifying through embodied awe and cold-shaking hands to compel the vault-unlocking choice. Interiority particularizes via astrolabe murmurs and grit-tasting memory, with exhaustion as earned cost in the final rest. Contradictory impulses surface in hardened resolve amid fatigue, driving micro-choices like tracing despite impatience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of meteor-tracing and murmurs builds to on-page RR closure as vault sighs open, spilling dust with Sel's exhaustion as legible cost in "Sel stood in the doorway and let the dust pass through their fingers." Orientation anchors Sel/setting by first paragraph; single continuous scene with elided nights coheres without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and astrolabe constrain choices (resting beneath, pointer trembling, warming stones), charging final image of dust swarming upward. Sensory details selective via POV urgency: tasted grit, metal murmurs, birch bark lines. World rules (unwritten calendar, siphoned stardust) learned through action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped creativity) signaled early via heard pressure; accumulative escalation via louder murmurs, shaking hands, and violet aurora flare narrows options to spiral-mapping climax. Agency in endurance/resting/tracing forecloses inaction path with exhaustion cost, felt unmistakably as Sel rests post-release holding astrolabe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory's spark vs. control emerges implicitly from stardust theft/release, reweighted in final murals blooming and Sel walking through "dreams finally given daylight." Resonance from particulars like meteor paths unlocking vault avoids morals; counter-reading (elders' fear cracking) adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, with perceptual signature in unspoken-word hearing and sky-pulse breath-matching. Rhythm modulates intensity: short urgent lines in tracing ("Another followed, then another") vs. breathing final image. Diction purposeful, lexicon fits dreamer's idiom without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "The astrolabe was heavy with memory; if Sel pressed an ear to it, the metal murmured"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language coherent/patterned ("bruise of green fire," "needle" meteor), enhancing without muddling peak vault-opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stardust-as-inspiration with hearing unspoken and meteor-tracing method transforms fantasy tropes via lived sensory logic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes (time-marked impatience) without obscuring closure; unwritten calendar/elders' hush confession inflects organically.</comment>
