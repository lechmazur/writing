<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rowan's silence as both ruin and possibility drives contradictory impulses, seen in heeding the "wrong turn" dare over EXIT; repair and song earn change with past fire's cost legible in patient hands. Interiority embodied in "pressure on the tongue." Final song reveals values hierarchy without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory hush builds to CR closure where silence reconfigures as "craft material" via song/halo, cost in prior muteness undeniable in final image of stirring train. Orientation anchored early in train/marsh. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Train's rivets/ropes and oasis reeds constrain junction choice and repair; bells recur tactilely ("sewn from bottle caps"), charging final steps. Sensory hush/mist filters via Rowan's bias, evolving causally to "trembling mirror." Micro-setting (halo shard) lights wood grains as map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence-as-possibility) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragment/wrong turn/oasis to song's cadence shift narrowing mute endurance into voiced act; agency in persistent repair forecloses silence's "ruin" with felt vocal cost. Oasis drink loosens hush as deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence as craft) emerges implicitly from hush-to-song arc, resonant CR in halo above horse reweighting premise without moral; particulars like bells-as-commas invite ambiguity on persistence's price. No tidy binary, counter-reading in "ruined his life once" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in hand-listening ("listen with his hands"); rhythm modulates from hush to "low note shaped by breath," diction hushed/gleaming purposeful. No dialogue; compression taught early, legible at halo image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short chime beats to flowing repair), high density in lines like "every mute gap might be a door"; figurative hush/gleam coherent, pattern pays off uncluttering closure song without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or drift; propulsion peaks at "train seemed to inhale."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus relic into silence-craft oasis, halo fragment transforming trope via shard-map light; risk in lyric hush risking opacity but heightens stakes coherently to CR horse-leading. Inevitable hindsight from bells' commas to finished sentence.</comment>
