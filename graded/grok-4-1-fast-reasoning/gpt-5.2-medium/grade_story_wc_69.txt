<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to braid voices emerges concretely from father's hatred unlearned, with contradictory resignation and stubbornness acting in her patient rehearsals; choir members apply relevant pressure without blurring focus. Final endurance of arts wing earned by prior micro-choices like repairing zither.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chaos rehearsal builds density to Charged Poise closure in quiet verdict, with councilman's line as RR reconfiguring stakes; orientation anchored early in library. One tightening via "subtracting noise" suffices, cost legible in foreclosed budget path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet library and zither rosette constrain choices—repair mirrors harmony quest, shadow laces sheet music at climax; autumn cold breathes through windows, selective sensory bias via Mara's priorities. Final image charges with rosette's eye framing air's passage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (arts survival) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as voices braid via agency in noise subtraction; Niko's zither solo forces council crystallization with felt social cost in unlearning. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to peak chord.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of braiding diverse voices against hatred emerges from rehearsal particulars, not statement; roll call of lost classes and final quiet verdict offer non-literal resonance reweighting progress memos as erasure. Zither reprise shifts motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mara's noticing—rosette vines worn smooth, echoes remembering practices; single POV stable, rhythmic modulation peaks in "room itself seemed to sing," lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, rhythm varies (short peak sentences amid lush); no loops, but figurative density borders overwriting in opening reflection—"absence disguised as efficiency"—without muddling causality. Closure image crisp, varied syntax supports cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Subtracting noise" method transforms choir trope into fresh accumulative tactic; zither repair/Niko solo inflects unlearning hatred uniquely, risk in quiet ending heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
