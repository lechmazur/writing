<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in Ira's dual allegiance, shown when she feeds Council "harmless truths" while tagging warnings; final choice to confront Vell earned by prior micro-choices like graffiti, with job risk as cost. Internal conflict embodied in "hope rise and panic chase it." Flawless under pressure, no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chip → graffiti code → reorganization → confrontation; closure as DC when Vell signs moratorium, cost legible in Ira's exhaustion and "one last mural." Orientation anchored early (Ira, Cadenza raft city). One tightening sufficient, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Raft seams, decks, graffiti under bunting constrain choices (hidden tie points loosened); final image of "stone heart cracking into many boats" charges closure. Sensory hierarchy via Ira's intuitive crowd sense; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fluid city) signaled early, tightens via security "new engines like teeth" forcing immediate action; agency in graffiti and confrontation forecloses privatization path with felt cost (Ira's payroll risk). Escalation causal, one deepening at climax sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fluidity vs. fixed grid emerges from particulars like quartz map and drifting blocks; final mural reweights premise non-literally as "stone heart cracking," with conceptual cost of endless vigilance. No moralizing, ambiguity in Vell's choice lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (orderly intuitive sensing of crowds/currents); voice rhythmic, modulates in "desperation sharpened her hope." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You can sell a map..."); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in varied syntax (e.g., " Dual allegiance kept her walking a tightrope"); no loops, artifacts, or overwriting in peak (confrontation clean). Rhythmic ear test passes; opening anchors stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Raft city's hidden seams and graffiti code synthesize fresh premise of fluid resistance to privatization; risk in reorder plan heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious turn: Vell's realization from "moving lights" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
