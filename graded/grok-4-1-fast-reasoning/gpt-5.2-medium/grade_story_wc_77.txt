<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in "lungs still tasted of pennywater and dust" and contradictory impulses (rest vs. enter funhouse) drive micro-choices like clasping the swan; final renunciation of fear earned via causal buildup from curse to booth action with bite-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory dread density tightens to booth climax; on-page CR closure in "fear...slid off me like wet paint" reconfigures curse-rule with legible cost (deprived proof, funhouse dark); orientation anchored early in funhouse entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fungus-mottled mirrors and swollen flash bulb constrain booth choice and multiply glow-stakes; recurring funhouse decay charges final dark image, filtering through POV's dread-biased perception without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant curse-stake signaled early escalates via advisor/dictionary deepening to agency-peak (press swan during flash), foreclosing fear-path with undeniable cost in gray image; lens-coherent pressure reweights options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of attention-as-net emerges organically from glowing curse/paradox notes to resonant CR-answer in dull photo-charm; final "shadows had lost interest" recharges prior luminance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "moonlight filtered through spoiled milk" sustains rhythmic control under booth-stress; stable single-POV with purposeful compression pays off in legible closure elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax without loops or muddled metaphors; "swan's twisted neck until it bit skin" exemplifies concrete propulsion in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of curse-luminance/clasp-sipping transforms funhouse-horror tropes; booth-flash reversal feels inevitable from paradoxical buildup, risking bold imagery without gimmick.</comment>
