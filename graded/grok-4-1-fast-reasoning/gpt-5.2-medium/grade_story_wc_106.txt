<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Lio weighs keeping the portrait (thief's craft) vs. returning it (mercy), earning the tear with embodied shake of fingers and felt cost of foreclosed vanishing path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to Charged Poise closure; portrait outline under moonbeams and door-listening cadence shift reconfigure stakes, with legible cost in torn image and quieted door.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emerald station constrains via platform-three door proximity and iron-jar hum, evolving sunset-to-moonlight charges final threshold image; tiles as "dark as bottled sea" mirror reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (door's whisper vs. choice) deepens accumulatively through recognition/bouquet/jar to agency-tear narrowing vanishing path; cost unmistakable in "tore the portrait in half" but minor abstractness in door's "respect" slips peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stolen moments repriced as gifts emerges organically via portrait-tear image answering "theft or invitation"; resonant non-literal closure reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (light-theft bias) consistent in second-person address as "invitation"; rhythm modulates to terse peak ("His fingers shook... tore"), with purposeful elision taught early and paid in door moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion via varied syntax matches scene cadence, high density in peak ("jar flared... tore"); figurative density purposeful and pattern-taught from opener but minor overload risks coherence in setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photographic theft as fate-hinges with moonbeam reinterpretation risks bold magical logic fully committed to closure; portrait-tear turn inevitable from portrait-thief premise.</comment>
