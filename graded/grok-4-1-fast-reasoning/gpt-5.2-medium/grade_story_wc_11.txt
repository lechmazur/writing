<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Composed trait constrains curiosity vs. protocol in violin lift; final amalgamation renunciation earned by crack's inventory-mercy conflict, with embodied "longing" cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as loops stack variations to crack's tightening; closure CR lands in sustained note without reset, costing violin's decay and endless search.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard ice constrains loops via violin's fragility; grippers' cold and crystal clicks filter through janitor bias, charging final steady twilight image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake escalates accumulatively via 15 loops' deepening to crack narrowing options; agency in selective amalgamation forces trade-off, cost legible in foregone timelines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of selective retention emerges via stacked glimpses, answered resonantly by log message reweighting procedure's premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature blends mechanical tidiness ("broom bristles by touch") with mysticism; stable close-third distance modulates rhythm through loop pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Density high with propulsion in varied syntax; no loops, precise "thin line of light" cuts time without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice violin's non-obvious synthesis of janitor routine and thought quest risks mundane mysticism payoff, inevitable via crack's hinge.</question>
