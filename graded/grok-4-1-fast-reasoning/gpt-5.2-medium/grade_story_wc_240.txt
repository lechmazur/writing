<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between loyalty and truth act in scene via laser experiment and log-sharing choice, earned by spatial observations; final renunciation forecloses loyalty path with felt relief/anger cost. Interiority concrete and embodied, e.g., "gut kept flagging a pattern."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from strangers' visits to pulse data to dialogue reveal, culminating in CR closure where log-sharing reconfigures barriers as "promise to measure what mattered"; cost legible in "letting go of the loyalty" and final laser image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent tunnels and vents constrain choices (e.g., heat signatures threading mesh) and charge final image of permeable gradients; sensory hierarchy POV-specific, narrowing to laser drafts under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pattern as fear of letting go) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via two-pulse reveal narrowing to audit decision; agency in sharing logs forecloses loyalty with on-page relational cost, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of barriers as gradients emerges organically from pulses and vents, resonant CR in final red line as "promise"; reweights premise without moral, inviting ambiguity on holding/letting go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with spatial perceptual signature (e.g., "remember a corridor by the pressure of its corners"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., auditors' reveal advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm matching pressure (short pulses in climax); no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful (e.g., "light spilled through, tracing tiny drafts").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mushroom-farm sci-fi with letting-go physics via laser pulses transforms surveillance trope; risk in poetic texture heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at closure image.</comment>
