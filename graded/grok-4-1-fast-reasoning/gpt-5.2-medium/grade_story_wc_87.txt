<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Broken navigator's contradictory impulses (flinch at name vs paddle inland) act in scene; final logbook writing earned by micro-choices like choosing next pole, with cost of no clean slate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of regret-backlash builds to RR closure in logbook writing/apology, cost legible in "not because he expected a clean slate"; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Utility poles as micro-setting constrain choices ("glanced at the utility poles sliding past, he chose the next one"); charges final image where they "gleamed like wet pencils."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align heart/action vs regret backlash) signaled early, tightens via squall/distance with Lita's shout forcing endurance; cost unmistakable in foreclosed hiding vs "beginning to steer."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-navigation emerges from particulars like compass-as-confession; final "gravitate toward tomorrow" resonantly reweights premise without moral, recharging poles/faith images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in navigation metaphors ("wet paper tears," "salt in a cut"); rhythmic control modulates from melancholic to light laugh under squall pressure; clean single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (backlash/snapping) taught early, no loops; minor overwrite in reflective beats avoided at closure "wrote an apology," propelling cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of redemption via inland kayak/utility poles transforms tropes; risk in lyric navigation metaphors inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes to logbook confrontation.</comment>
