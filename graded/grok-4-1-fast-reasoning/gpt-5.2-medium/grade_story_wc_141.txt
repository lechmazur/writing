<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Eli's myth-busting chase for the "ache behind" hoaxes, embodied in cheerful whistling amid gloom; final renunciation of fleeing conversations earned via micro-choices like kinder retellings with damp cheeks as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: object discoveries density-build to whisper-folded hush and CR closure where compass vanishes, reweighting myths with conceptual cost in "honest gaps"; orientation anchored early, no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring objects (shell, cello) constrain choices—shell fits curve perfectly, charges final image as "heart that could listen"; sensory bias (smells of salt/varnish/rain) selective via Eli's perceptual cheer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled via letter, tightens accumulatively as retellings steady needle upward, forcing trade-off in honest gaps; agency in humming back yields felt emotional cost (damp cheeks), legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of myths as "crooked map toward something true" emerges via particulars like circling constellations' "empty center"; final CR image of clear glass reweights premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity in method of pause.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in biased noticing ("gloom sat... but Eli whistled"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, prose-as-character reflects cheerful mind without withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., shell smell evokes salt/varnish/rain while advancing); figurative pattern taught early pays off in hum-braiding closure without muddle or loops, rhythmic variety passes read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting via sound-gaps and ephemeral tools transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in shell-as-heart closing image.</comment>
