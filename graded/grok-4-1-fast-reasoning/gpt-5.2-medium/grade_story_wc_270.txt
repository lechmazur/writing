<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nara's motivation to evolve tradition roots in her crystal rebellion, compelling the high-stakes unsealing choice with child's counterweight; contradictory impulses peak when embryo searches, earned by prior causality. Child's plant telepathy shows embodied reactions revealing character under pressure. Closure renunciation of implanted oracle feels inevitable with visible cost in rewritten script.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from reed confession to kite decoding to unsealing, one tightening via warning/imprinting risk narrows options. Closure as RR/CR lands on-page ("salamander bright as spring leaves" reconfigures destiny) with conceptual cost (foreclosed oracle path). Orientation anchored early in village/hot springs; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs constrain climax ("stone lip burned our palms," sulfur bubbles dictate steps), charge final image as embryo rises there. Plants/lichens/moss as micro-setting enable decoding via POV bias. Sensory hierarchy (steam curtains, humming ground) reflects urgency, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition vs. implanted destiny) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via decoding warning forcing counterweight choice. Agency in Nara's story-speaking forecloses conquest path with legible cost (imprinting risk). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at hatch, protagonist alteration drives resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chosen destiny emerges from particulars (crystal rebellion, plant chorus, spoken story), final salamander-to-garden image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting tradition-as-tool. Subtext in embryo's "search for a story" avoids moralizing, complexity lingers in repair over oracle. Earned from conflicts without thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature (plant "sensations of thirst and sunlight"); diction/rhythm poetic yet biased (e.g., "lichens spelled slow warnings"). Voice modulates intensity at unsealing, no head-hopping. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("tradition was a tool").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "seven breaths, then lowered it into steam"); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts in peak beats. Purposeful metaphors (e.g., "steam rose in curtains") integrate without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening but supports textural lens payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: plant telepathy decodes kite for amber-unsealing, story-rewriting embryo into Rebuilder transforms destiny trope organically. Risky fantasy logic (vines echo pulse) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via prior plant patterns. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
