<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to reawaken beauty drives consistent micro-choices like hiding the bow and using heart rhythms, with embodied anger shaking his violin hand at the chained tree. Interiority concrete via pulse-matching and father's backstory tilting present action. Final understanding earned without unmotivated epiphany; minor summary of stubborn motive keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: rumor leads to orchard incursion, shell signaling disrupts statues (tightening), enabling tree-play climax. On-page DC as tree uproots with crack like resolving chord, cost in stone hands seizing Lio amid struggle. Orientation anchored early via sky-bridge and Gearford; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard constrains via statues' rasping patrol and chained tree, forcing shell tactic; locust shell as micro-setting enables vibration. Sensory hierarchy: sap-coal tarnish mirrors stakes. Final dust-softened statues charge image; 9+ gate met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free beauty) signaled early, tightens via signaling reversal on statues, uproots with agency/cost as roots snare ankles. Causal escalation coherent; statues seize tests commitment visibly. Minor abstract residue in rumor but on-page pressure lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rhythmic reshaping emerges via violin-to-heart/tree progression, final walking tree/st swaying statues as non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars like PROPERTY tags reweight mechanical capture. 9+ resonant reconfiguring of premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias: Lio hears heartbeats through wood/tree throb. Distinct poetic texture ("velvet could file metal without sparks") modulates rhythmically under stress. No dialogue; elision purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "sap surged, bark flexed" advances action/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent ("tags quiver like guilty teeth"). Propulsion peaks at "crack that sounded like a chord resolving"; zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: heart-rhythm locust shell frees bolted tree in steampunk orchard, transforming statues via musical disruption. Risky poetic conceit inevitable in hindsight; bold closure with following guards heightens without gimmick.</comment>
