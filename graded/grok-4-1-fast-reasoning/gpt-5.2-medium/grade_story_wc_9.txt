<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when narrator wants to snatch pouch but daughter's weight compels reliving lost time with felt cost of enduring hurt; embodied emotions like "milk chokes a tired throat" root interiority concretely. Final renunciation earned by prior bargaining reveal. No safety-hedging in flawed willingness to perplexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: saucer crack pattern leads to glade (taught early via tablecloth blank), pouch discovery reweights stake, cards-at-roots spread triggers CR closure where time returns via scar-image with cost of "whatever hurt came." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sigh-stair and glade grass "jeweled with ice-light" constrain journey (ribbon tether) and charge final tablecloth scar; sensory hierarchy narrows to "painfully clear" air under crisis. Vapor-tree pouches mirror internal repentance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim time) signaled via blank space; tightening at pouch touch changes knowledge to own repentance, forcing agency in card-spread endurance that forecloses escape with on-page cost of relived "feverish dawns." Escalation coheres accumulatively to cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time owed emerges via hand-tracings shifting from blank to scarred overlap, reweighting premise non-literally; pouch confession integrates concept without statement. Final image answers central question of lost time's locus with resonant scar-cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "taste their absence" and rhythmic syntax like "fat as a plum" modulate with intensity; first-person stable, bias toward cartomantic symbols coherent. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "pouches that pulsed like lungs" coherent in lyric pattern taught early; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in glade rewarded as voice-motivated for closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, postpartum time-theft, vapor-tree glade transforms tropes; saucer-crack map and hand-scar payoff inevitable from particulars, bold risks heighten without gimmickry.</comment>
