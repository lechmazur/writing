<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to encrypt vulnerability as strength drives consistent micro-choices like dancing codes and dice rolls, revealing internal conflict between calm and fear in embodied actions. Final endurance of defiance earns closure with visible cost (water surge, leaving journal). Minor abstraction in "calm defiance" phrasing slightly tempers peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from journal entries to spider drop cueing alarm reroute, yielding Charged Poise closure as pods open and escape with legible cost (groggy flight through water). Orientation anchors early (sunken lab, Lyra's return). No lens ambiguity; persistent pod wiring constraint shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken lab's cracked glass, silted alarms, coral-scabbed doors constrain choices (dance fools flooded mics, manual wheel needs cipher). Spider web recurs to charge final journal wedge image. Sensory hierarchy (sonic cues twitch Oren's eyes) reflects Lyra's lyrical bias; evolves causally (lights cut, water surges).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate via untriggered codes) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via guardian surveillance tightening to spider-cued climax narrowing options (reroute or drown). Agency in dance/journal drives deepening; cost felt in "cold as diagnosis" surge charging escape. One tightening suffices, but minor static pressure pre-spider drop tempers band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges organically via ciphered journal/dance, culminating in non-literal final image: journal as decoy for council, real meaning carried by freed. Counter-reading (guardian fooled) lingers without moralizing; reweights premise through particulars like Oren mouthing poem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (meter in noise, dice as syllables) stable in single POV; modulates rhythmically under stress (short clack sentences at dice roll). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I came to finish our work"); no head-hopping, purposeful compression taught early pays off in legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rolled the hangman's dice... clack like familiar syllables" advances plot/voice); rhythm varies read-aloud. Figurative density pattern-taught as cipher motif avoids muddle, but "calm defiance" recurrence borders loop in high-pressure beats, dulling propulsion slightly at spider drop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hangman's dice, dance-ciphers, spider-web cue synthesize fresh heist via lyrical code-breaking, transforming tropes organically. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes without opacity; final journal reprise inevitable from early web seed elevates ingenuity.</comment>
