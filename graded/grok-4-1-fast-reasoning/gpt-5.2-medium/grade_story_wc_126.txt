<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's perceptive ears embody contradiction as gift/burden, driving micro-choices like tapping the bowl and circling the knot with violin, earning closure acceptance of unfinished world with visible cost in incomplete ripple.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from harbor hush to greenhouse unbinding; closure RR lands on-page in "cistern finally ripples," reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of "not healed, but newly allowed to be incomplete."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain choice at cistern knot-site, charging final image of rippling water and returning sounds; sound hierarchy via POV ears integrates purposefully without visual dominance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unbind hush tightens via resistance "like twine around her wrist," forcing pitch changes; agency in story-violin tactic forecloses restoration path with felt cost in partial ripple under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges implicitly via bowl-notes story and incomplete trees; final image of Mara laughing and planning next bonfire offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting hush without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sound-biased perceptual signature ("pin tremble," "tiny clicks"); rhythmic diction modulates from muffled hush to released "ordinary noise," heightening pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bowl pressed to the water" advances sound, action, stakes); no loops, coherent metaphors (hush as knot/wet cloth), varied rhythm propels to closure ripple without overwriting in peak unbinding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-burn hush unbound by story-violin in bowl feels inevitable from family tradition seed; risk-taking lyric hush-as-knot charges stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
