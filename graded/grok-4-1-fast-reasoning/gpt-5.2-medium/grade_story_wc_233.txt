<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's disenchantment and internal conflict (sick of prophecies yet tempted by power) drive contradictory impulses, culminating in earned choice to enter fissure despite throne loss threat; Rovan as foil applies subtle pressure without diluting her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dreams → warning → journey → ritual → fissure act as DC closure with legible cost in "soot-streaked and steady" emergence and "plainness frightened her," reconfiguring her rule; single scene oriented early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto and ember fissure constrain climb/ritual choices and charge final cooling embers image; sensory details (ash/violets, heat biting gloves) filter through queen's priorities, mirroring her unraveling without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end dreams/stop sky bleed) tightens via ritual revelation forcing throne-or-wound choice; protagonist agency peaks in fissure descent, paying physical cost that forecloses temptation path under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of autonomy vs. steered fate emerges organically from dream temptation and final ordinary sky reweighting power's allure; resonant non-literal closure in plainness as cost avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with distinct perceptual signature (lace/bleeding motifs as biased noticing); voice modulates rhythmically under stress, dialogue sparse/natural/subtextual ("sleep had become her enemy"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but figurative density (lace/embroidery/silk/velvet) borders overwriting in ascent without full restraint; no loops/artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-prophecy temptation into queen's intimate ritual/climb resolution transforms fantasy tropes; risk in quiet conceptual cost (plain sky as freedom's threat) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
