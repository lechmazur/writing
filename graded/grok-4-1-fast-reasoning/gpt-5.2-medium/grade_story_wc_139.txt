<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's ledger as internal metric creates contradictory impulses—aid Sami but reject Ivo's lies—culminating in earned defiance at "Ivo watched his con collapse." Internal conflict embodied in hiding Mercy then deploying it truthfully; flaws like inherited wariness drive competent struggle without hedging. Ivo and Sami apply crucible pressure via status dynamics, with distinct voices in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Ivo's arrival → Mara's Mercy choice → agents' softened questions → Sami's shelter grant as Charged Poise CR, with relational cost to Ivo legible in "Ivo stood...smaller." Single scene oriented instantly in prep room; one tightening via buzzer escalates to closure without unkept setups or amnesia. Agents' entry convenient but motivated by border stakes, paying off in margin-reading pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prep room anchors via "disinfectant and roses," "stainless table," gurgling drain; Mercy ink pot as recurring micro-setting constrains Mara's choice and charges final placement beside corpse's hands. Sensory hierarchy (taste/smell/touch) reflects embalmer's POV urgency; spatial choreography clear through counter slides and doorways. Details evolve causally, mirroring vitality in death via "death looked ready to speak."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara's fair-trade calculus vs. Ivo's con—tightens causally via Mercy affidavit defying rehearsal, forcing trade-off when agents demand passport. Escalation peaks in toe-tag slide narrowing options, with agency in margin insistence; cost felt in Ivo's collapse foreclosing his dominance. Moral calculus between truth/lies sharpens climax without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth's pricing emerges organically from ledger/Mercy motifs shifting from con-tool to honest breach, reweighting father-daughter rule-set in final image without moralizing. Subtext in silences like unclaimed tag implies nameless erasure risk; complexity lingers in Mara's ongoing "calculating" ambiguity. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, with CR tying asylum to personal repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature biases toward numbers/equations ("mapped his fear into numbers"); diction/rhythm modulates from calm prep to terse crisis ("room seemed to inhale formaldehyde"). Sparse dialogue goal-driven—Sami's soft proofs vs. Ivo's charm—with subtext advancing plot; no head-hopping, elisions taught via Mercy myth and paid in agents' shimmer. Voice distinct: Mara's precise idiom vs. Ivo's shuffle terms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "washed the body's hands...deserved symmetry" advancing ritual/character; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in short agents' entry sentences. Minor metaphor density ("liquefies rigid thinking" echoed literally) purposeful via Mercy's magic logic, no muddle or loops dulling closure. Clean mechanics, specific verbs/nouns; no scaffold or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magic ink pot synthesizing con heritage, asylum stakes, funeral rites into fresh CR feels inevitable; risk in quasi-magical "shimmer" payoff transforms tropes without gimmickry. Bold tonal vitality-death fusion heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, particular details like torn passport/toe tag anchor ingenuity.</comment>
