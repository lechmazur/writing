<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to hush prophecy roots in clear traits and intensifies via internal conflict over erasing warning vs. firestorm; embodied in fingertip reading and third-path choice. Contradictory impulses (thwart factions vs. save from poison) act simultaneously without tidy resolution. Minor abstraction in emotional embodiment slightly undercuts peak stress degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence mapping builds density to pattern break (prophecy ripples decoded) and cadence shift (crane dissolution). On-page Charged Poise closure reconfigures prophecy into private mercy with conceptual cost (truth dulled for thousands' warning). Orientation anchors early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (brook mist, cricket pauses, leaf drips) filters through Liora's silence-mapping priorities, constraining tactics. "Terrestrially cosmic stones" ground cosmic pull and charge final dissolution image. Micro-setting (flat stone, twig lines) evolves causally, mirroring hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush code before factions decode) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven filter choice narrowing erase/warn options. Accumulative escalation densifies to reweighting with felt cost (prophecy grounded, not spread). Price legible in dulled stream music and private burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of secrets-as-mercy emerges organically from hush filter and crane dissolution, resisting tidy moral via ambiguity (poison risk lingers). Final image (blank petals snowfall) resonantly reweights code-to-truth arc without statement. Subtext in silence gaps charges without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (pauses as lines, ripples as data); diction/rhythm modulates from preparatory calm to peak crystallization. Purposeful poetic compression taught early via "smoothed hush," legible at crane joining. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/action without redundancy; rhythm varies (short drips to long hush). Figurative language ("tranquil blaze") patterns consistently without muddle in climax. Minor register elevation in cosmic descriptors risks opacity but serves voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami prophecy hush via silence mapping transforms summoning trope into textured mercy arc. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes (code as bird ripples) with inevitable hindsight payoff in petal snowfall. Non-obvious conceptual integrity in "lie loud enough to drown truth."</comment>
