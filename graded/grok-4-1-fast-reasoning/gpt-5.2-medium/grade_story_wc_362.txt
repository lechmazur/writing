<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—protesting Lio's claims yet naming anger that triggers the crackle—earn the final letting-go with visible emotional cost. Lio's grounded mysticism applies precise pressure through micro-choices like prism placement. Interiority embodied in frost-swirls and voice-weight avoids labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from prism-frost to mirror-voice, culminating in CR where assumptions shatter internally, reweighting grief with cost of unopened sorrow legible in "I finally let her go." Orientation anchored early in arbor-mist. One tightening via anger-naming suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor mist and river-clay boots constrain ritual via frost patterns; car as micro-setting absorbs tears, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (fern needles, crackle hush) filters through narrator's doubt. No white-room; evolves with breath-darkened swirls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth of sister's drive) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as revelations narrow doubt to acceptance, foreclosing anger-path with cost in "stopped hating its bent frame." Agency via attention/renunciation; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotion-soaked objects emerges organically from car/letter/prism, answered non-literally in moonlight spectra as "hand on my shoulder," reweighting absence into evidence without moralizing. Subtext in "truthful lies" omission enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (soft/exact eyes, light crawling) biases noticing mystically yet grounded; dialogue subtextual (Lio's protective nod). Rhythmic control modulates hush-intensity; no head-hopping, elision taught via witness-prism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "light...crawled along frost lines until filigree looked like a map"); no loops, varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor figurative density in peak frost-map risks slight overwrite but pays off without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: car's emotion-absorption mechanic transforms grief via frost-commune/prism-witness, risking mystic logic that heightens stakes organically. Final CR inevitable from grounded particulars; no template tropes.</comment>
