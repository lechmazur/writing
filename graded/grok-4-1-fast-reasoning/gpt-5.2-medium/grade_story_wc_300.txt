<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation shifts convincingly from routine inspection to carrying "collected light," earned through micro-choices like pressing pearl to seashell and reading aloud; widower's trembling hands and confession reveal flaws that pressure her. Internal conflict emerges in certifying failure yet pursuing hope. Minor epiphanic telling ("Mara understood then") slightly undercuts embodiment at pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pearl curiosity to cave recitations to crowning, yielding Charged Poise closure where radiance dissolves grudges with legible cost (unsealed bunker, noncompliant report). Orientation anchored early at Vault Seventeen entrance. Single scene with spatial progression coherent; one tightening via widower's reveal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal caves and seashell fossil constrain revelation and ritual, charging final radiance image; sensory details (lantern rainbows, pearl warming) selective via Mara's professional gaze. Atmosphere's hush mirrors emotional hush effectively. Micro-setting (pearl, shell) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bunker certification) deepens accumulatively to dissolving heart-walls via confessions; one tightening (pearl activation forecloses mechanical sealing) driven by Mara's agency narrows options. Cost visible in unsealed door and softened faces. No reversals needed under lens; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging hopes emerges organically from pearl's function, answered non-literally in "old grudges dissolve" image reweighting bunker's isolation premise. Subtext in etched spirals avoids moralizing. Complexity in widower's guilt lingers without tidy redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual bias (inspector noting "filters" then "latent radiance"); POV stable, single focalizer. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven (widower's plea rushes inspection, reveals via hesitation). Rhythmic modulation heightens ritual beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors ("silent rainbows," "listening ears") taught early, propels via varied rhythm; minor repetition ("abandoned hope," "resonant hush") echoes thematically without loops. No scaffold or artifacts dull climax flare. Concision strong, minor figurative density in recitals prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pearl-seashell-confession mechanic transforms bunker trope into fresh magical realism; risk in unsealed fate heightens stakes organically. Synthesis of inspection realism and latent hopes inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
