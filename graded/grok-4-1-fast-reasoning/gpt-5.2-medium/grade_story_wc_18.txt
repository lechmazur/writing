<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Lio's grounded artisan traits clashing with the dream's boundary-erasing pull, embodied via rib-brushing sensation and precise rebuilding choices; final internalization earned through prior causal buildup. Firmly grounded nature constrains wild dream-chasing into methodical mirror work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sextant find to failed sighting ("star slid sideways") tightening to mirror-breathing alignment; closure as Charged Poise RR in final image—"carried a window where no wall could hold"—with legible conceptual cost of unchanged world vs. internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog, frost, and mirrors as micro-setting constrain tactics (fog pools flattened by breathing) and charge final image; terrace branches as "black antennas" mirror dream's ascent, sensory hierarchy via artisan's edge-focus selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, escalates texturally via failed sextant use forcing mirror invite ("could not trap... had to invite"); agency in breathing alignment forecloses force-path with on-page cost felt in stable erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries theme emerges organically from orchard constellations to internalized dream-mirror; final line reweights premise non-literally—dream captured yet district ruined—embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (edges, reflections, fog as "still pool") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from steady workshop build to peak terrace pressure, compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm ("inhale drew fog... exhale pressed it flat"); figurative language (fog sheets as "ground glass") consistent and pattern-integrated without muddle or loops, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-craft, dream-capture, and breathing-metronome transforms dream-trope into inevitable grounded ingenuity; risk in boundary-erasure premise heightens stakes organically through sextant rebuild.</comment>
