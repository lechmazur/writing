<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between dye-master control ("keep beauty from ruining cloth") and Sairi's openness act in trail-following hesitation; vow renunciation of hoarding earned by accumulating glints of her helps, with heart's hammering as embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sun trail dots build density of revelations to CR closure in jar sparks reweighting story-magnetism, with "heart hammered against my ribs as if it recognized them all" as legible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating tea house and prisms constrain light-chasing choices; mirror/map as micro-settings force tactical action, charging final mist-illuminating sparks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (story-magnetism) deepens accumulatively via glints narrowing self-focus to relational practice; trail endurance forecloses old habits with heart-quickening fear and vow's felt reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final sparks painting helped lives offer non-literal answer to magnetism question, recharging "plot hook" into practice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dye-master perceptual signature ("every stain and every lie") biases details consistently; dialogue subtextual (Eno's "illuminate the paths others ignore") advances under stable first-person distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "the dye leapt up in sparks, quietly explosive in my palms"); varied rhythm propels without loops or muddled metaphors in peak jar beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (donor heart, sun-trail map) synthesized into iridescent dye practice; risky accumulative revelations heighten CR without gimmickry.</comment>
