<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Navigator's interiority shines in embodied scars and contradictory uncertainty about the caller, compelling the build and guidance choices. Final endurance as promise earned via prior causality with Sera's reunion cost. Minor abstraction in "geography of loss" doesn't dilute pivotal micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of calls and censer nudges build to CR closure—"not a machine but a promise"—with legible emotional cost in reunion. Orientation anchored early in station amid salt flats. No ambiguity or disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Censer foot as micro-setting constrains sketches and charges final armillary swing toward home. Sensory details like jammed doors and moon hook selectively mirror loss. Environment guides migration choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating altered routes tightens accumulatively via calls warning sinkholes, forcing armillary reliance. Agency in building forecloses old maps with cost to Sera's path. Escalation reweights via lunar shifts, legible in full-moon swing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loss as terrain emerges organically from armillary's nightly shifts paralleling grief. Final CR reweights premise—guiding back transforms hydraulics-failure into promise—without moralizing. Resonance in Sera's "half prayer, half wound" image lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in navigator's idiomatic metaphors (e.g., "mouth that forgot how to ask for water") biases noticing toward relics and tides. Stable first-person distance heightens emotional beats. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in boy's reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; metaphors purposeful (censer "nudges my sketches by a hair") without muddle in peak builds. Zero loops or scaffolds propel to closure image. Minor dense phrasing in openings supports lyric texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-tide compass and reverse migration in post-flood world; moon-fluctuating anchor transforms trope of failed tech. Risky poetic compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via boy's calls.</comment>
