<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reluctant caretaker's contradictory impulses shine in "I should refuse, because every rescue tightens the curse, yet my orchard was planted to mark safe paths," earning the final ethical decision with embodied curse costs; minor reflection slightly dilutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with impression-building density leading to Charged Poise closure—"I decide to finish the remaining waystones"—reconfiguring curse as ethical tool with tightening cost legible in final orchard image; orientation anchors instantly, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth stone and mechanical birds constrain assembly/res cue choices, frost charges final escape; recurring impressions as micro-setting evolve causally, mirroring internal shaping without overt symbolism—"the rock wants instruction."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue before frost) tightens via assembly reversal narrowing options under textural lens, agency in denting bird for mercy; cost felt in curse but lacks one more visceral tactical forfeiture at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of curse-as-outward-ethics emerges organically from blueprint's shift to "map of ethics," final image reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity in endurance lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("offhandedly exact") biases sensory hierarchy toward precise impressions; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, rhythm modulates with pressure—no head-hopping, stable distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("breath stains the stone") propels without loops; minor figurative density in opening risks slight slowdown but supports voice—no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of touchless shaping and blueprint ethics transforms curse trope; risk in non-causal impressions pays off in inevitable closure reconfiguration.</comment>
