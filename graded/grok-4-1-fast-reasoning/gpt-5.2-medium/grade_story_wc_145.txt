<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in tasting "converge" like an editor and tracing condensation reveals dry-witted precision under pressure; Lysa's tranquil worry subtly crucifies the stance without deeper relational shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via falcon vellum to condensation pattern tightening to spring discovery; Charged Poise closure at bubbling spring reconfigures blank space with Ministry cost legible in "throat tightened" anticipation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake's sighing ice and outpost's fogged pane constrain discovery and charge final spring image; atlas-editor POV filters water patterns purposefully, evolving causally with trek.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map rivers tightens accumulatively through vellum "Converge" and droplet compass; agency in grease-pencil tracing forecloses ignorance with Ministry reaction cost viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Convergence theme emerges organically from hydrological particulars and phrasebook fears; final spring "beginning again and again" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting maps as weapons.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dry-witted perceptual signature ("tasting the implication," water "tells on itself") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from outpost poise to trek tightening without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring water branching; purposeful water metaphors cohere without muddle, though minor figurative density in spring beat borders overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydrology convergence via falcon/condensation transforms mapping trope; bold lyric accumulative risk heightens stakes to conceptual Ministry cost without gimmickry.</comment>
