<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivo's motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason" roots choices consistently, with peripheral focus enabling layered sound separation. Micro-choices like coin-gear and marble-sliver reveal values under pressure. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak beats, but endurance earns closure without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections, sounds, tremors builds to RR closure as cavern "exhale[s] in relief" with timer holding "gentle chorus"—felt cost in implied overflow release and pass closure. Orientation anchored early (Ivo, quarry, cavern). One tightening via tremor insight reweights stakes purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marble cavern constrains via angles ("marking on marble where lanternlight... struck") and supplies escapement sliver, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (peripheral edges, echo layers). Details evolve causally (thaw/freeze, cracks) without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix timer, capture echoes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tremor ("swallowing... overflow") forcing marble-escapement tradeoff. Agency in reverse-engineering narrows options; cost legible in days spent and "pass closed again." Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder stored against reason emerges via particulars (echo harvest ripening, timer combing air), reweighted in final "hidden cellar door to wonder." No moralizing; resonance from conflicted storage with cavern's conceptual cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("scratch beside a keyhole," "snowmelt traced quick silver lines"). Texture distinct in syntax/rhythm (lyric compression taught early). Diction modulates with intensity, prose as character in reflective phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayered (e.g., "turning the broken timer... to imagine what rhythm"). No loops, metaphors coherent ("brass ribs," "combing the air"). Rhythm varies, propulsion ties to scene (ticks aligning echoes).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith "fix[es] time" via echo-harvest in overflow cavern transforms tropes organically. Risky metaphorical physics (sounds ripening) follows implications to charged poise. Inevitable hindsight from metal-memory premise.</comment>
