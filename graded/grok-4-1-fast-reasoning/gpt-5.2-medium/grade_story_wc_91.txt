<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amina's contradictory impulses—sensible plan versus cave impulse—act in scene, earning the final shared realization with embodied cost in ash and escape. Micro-choices like releasing bugs reveal values under pressure. Priest's suspicion-to-wonder shift applies relational crucible cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density builds to CR closure in "change was hot, granular, and shared," with legible cost in tremor escape and lava hiss. Orientation anchors early in beach/volcano/dusk. Escape crack as tactic reconfigures survival options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave minerals and warm stones constrain choices, charging final steaming sand image. Sensory hierarchy (hush under sounds, bugs' pulses) reflects Amina's bias. Evolving details (ash sifting, lava ribbon) mirror transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to feel transformation's texture tightens via cave detour and priest/tremor, forcing agency in bug release and lantern directive under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in ash cough and foreclosed rope-grab fear. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of gathering villagers offers non-literal answer to transformation query, reweighting giving-into-heat motif from particulars. Subtext in bug spiral and prophecy mishearing embraces ambiguity without morals. Resonance inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in hush/rhythm noticing biases prose to Amina's idiom. Stable single-POV distance modulates with intensity; brief dialogue natural/subtextual (jar gift rearranges suspicion). Rhythmic control heightens cave pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied syntax/rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative pattern (hush, spirals, equations) taught early without muddle in peak tremor beat. Minor elevated diction fits lyrical voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coincidence-orchestration, captive stars prophecy, and textural magic feels inevitable; bugs-as-guide escape risks bold volcano communion. Transformation test passes: premise uniquely anchors universals in lived giving/hush.</comment>
