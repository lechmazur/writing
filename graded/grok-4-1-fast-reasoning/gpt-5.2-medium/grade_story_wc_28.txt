<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Samir's gentle radicalism drives contradictory impulses—vengeance-refusal via Grasp—culminating in earned stasis of the truce-sharing, with embodied cost in steel-framed empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; chipped mosaic vision causally anchors retrocognition, tightening to tessera-fit renaming and final Grasp truce as charged poise with legible relational cost in "chewing... first quiet truce."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone as micro-setting constrains visions and charges closure via tessera insertion, filtering sensory details through Samir's mason bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant mercy stake signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Lina's stone vision forcing stance crystallization; agency in Grasp offer forecloses vengeance with on-page labor cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tessera-flare renaming reweights names-as-scaffolds theme non-literally, emerging from mercy particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature ("warmth that felt cold") biases noticing; sparse dialogue carries subtext (Lina's "punishment" laugh), distinguishing voices under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels; minor early figurative density (e.g., "truth into a wound") risks overwrite but clears by closure's clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grasp cuffs-with-bread and chip-retrocognition synthesize fresh mercy-radicalism, transforming post-fire tropes via irreplaceable steel empathy.</comment>
