<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's synesthetic interiority and contradictory impulses—seeking truth via prototype despite prickling suspicion of Rell—embody motivation; micro-choice to solder Jory's brass earns reconfiguration when she records confession and forges ahead, with relational cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as densities of absences build to prototype replay revealing click in Rell's speech; CR closure lands on-page when Mara pockets aid and melts brass, with conceptual cost of betrayal imprinting future designs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and wreck ring constrain dives for silences and anchor forge work; apple blossoms opening amid confession charge final image, mirroring cellular growth against betrayal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture trust's break tightens texturally as device bleeds silences into Rell's words, forcing confession; agency in questioning forecloses ignorance, cost visible in his flinch and her chest bruise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memories forging or rotting emerges implicitly via absences imprinting truth; final forging of housings offers resonant answer to central question without moralizing, reweighting prior silences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("hearing colors faintly... tasting blue") biases all noticing consistently; rhythmic prose modulates from aurora hush to sharp click, stable single POV under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via lines like "jars of silence labeled with depth and tide"; varied rhythm and coherent metaphors (memories as fish in silt) avoid loops, clear propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic aids imprinting wreck silences transforms memory trope organically; bold drowned orchard forge risks abstract CR payoff, inevitable in hindsight via cellular growth parallel.</comment>
