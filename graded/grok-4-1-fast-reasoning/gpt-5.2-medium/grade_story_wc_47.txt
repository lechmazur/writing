<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's watchful scanning and trembling hands reveal contradictory impulses of fear and proactivity acting simultaneously; proffer of pendant as key earns closure choice with relational cost over personal relic. Interiority particular via mother's pollen fleck glowing with breath. Jun's fear shoulders apply crucible pressure without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: confession viral → moss garden build → drip pattern translation → Jun arrival → pendant proffer reconfigures isolation into alliance (Charged Poise RR) with legible cost of forfeited relic. Orientation anchored early in data center. Single scene causality tight, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moss garden micro-setting constrains via drip pipe for code and vine curtain for reveal; charges final brighter moss image mirroring regen. Sensory hierarchy (sap taste, wet cables, mud boots) POV-biased and selective. Spatial choreography coherent through aisle/proximity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake signaled early tightens via Jun's fearful arrival forcing reveal/proffer agency under Accumulative lens; narrows to relational trade-off with pendant cost. Moral calculus (confess buyers) sharpens peak. Visible price alters tactics from solo to shared.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Regeneration theme emerges organically from betrayal-to-compost arc via drip honeycomb angles and pendant seal; final "confession could be compost" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in Jun's nod amid hush invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (imagining kinder timelines, sap quiet) biases noticing; voice rhythm modulates from reflective to tense reveal. Dialogue subtextual (Jun skips why, asks plan) pursues goals naturally. Stable first-person, no leakage; compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., icicles percussion yields code); rhythm varies read-aloud via short drip beats into longer hush. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught as regen motif without muddle or loops at closure. Propulsion clear, no scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious drip-icicle honeycomb code transforms data betrayal via nature logic; moss-over-servers fresh frame risks bold lyricism heightening stakes. Non-obvious synthesis inevitable in pendant seal payoff. No derivative echoes.</comment>
