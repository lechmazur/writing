<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maris's contradictory impulses—leading father without argument yet decisively sheathing his rifle—earn Tarek's change; embodied perception like "hears thirst before leaves curl" reveals pacifist traits under pressure. Tarek's arc from scoffing to kneeling and planting shows meaningful renunciation with relational cost. Minor label-speak ("senselessly perceptive") slightly undercuts interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from talisman to rose refusal to militia standoff, culminating in Charged Poise RR as Tarek plants seeds, reconfiguring violence-to-continuity with felt cost in Lio's trembling and dusk. Single scene anchors early (dome, post-tower); linkages like rifle-sheathing narrow options without breaks. Closure cost legible in "soft scrape of shovel."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dome and roses constrain choices—blossoms "stay shut" with armed hands—forcing kneel; soot "dark snow" and "engines through sand" evolve atmosphere, mirroring chaos-to-calm. Sensory hierarchy (thorns, heat, drums) filters via Maris's perceptual bias. Final ring planting charges image with environmental continuity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Lio/continuity vs. bounty) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven sheathing and kneeling amid militia pressure, forcing Tarek's stance shift under Situational lens. One deepening (rose refusal) narrows violent options with visible cost in flexed fingers and unsettled militia. Enters 8.8 via charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-quiet emerges organically via talisman engraving shifting to seed rings; final planting offers non-literal answer ("continuity could be grown"), reweighting chaos with counter-reading in Tarek's unbuckled belt. Resonance from particulars avoids morals; irony in bounty hunter's pacifist craft lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited on Maris with perceptual signature ("sees without sensing"); rhythmic diction modulates from filtered sun to "widening dusk," heightening pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Tarek to militia); no head-hopping, elision purposeful in Lio's hiding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "roses nearest... refusal a silent lesson") without loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherent ("tranquil blaze," "gravity pulls sand"); rhythm varies, peaks clean in sheathing beat. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: plants inculcated with "mercy into thorns" transforms pacifism trope, risking lyric desert eco-allegory that heightens stakes via rose agency; talisman-to-seed arc inevitable in hindsight. Bold perceptual voice avoids generics.</comment>
