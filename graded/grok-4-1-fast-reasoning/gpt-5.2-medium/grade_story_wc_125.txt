<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak ethically in the slipknot third game, earning the restraint closure with visible cost of sealed full discovery. Interiority concrete via rope's sweat/iron smell and knots as decisions. No stock phrasing; voice particularizes flaws without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of layers/ropes/knots builds to CR closure where time's braided texture reconfigures premise, cost felt in poet's ongoing restraint vs. temptation. Orientation anchored early in highways/energy beings. Pattern taught via rope strata-matching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto clay bands constrain/mirror rope pattern choice, glowing under starlight charges layers' murmurs (dust/lovers/stone). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: time's texture audible/rough. Micro-setting (rope as tool) evolves tactilely, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time texture discovery sans hour-thinning) tightens texturally via bargain to slipknot game, narrowing to restraint trade-off. Climax agency forecloses full release, cost legible in "sealing my own discovery." One deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (braided time/mercy/cost) emerges via rope/layers/visitors' stanzas, final image reweights restraint as human-sized map without moral. Subtext in knot as lock anyone turns; complexity lingers in temptations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (texture/grain/braids) biases noticing; poetic compression taught early (roadside poet), legible at CR closure. Rhythm modulates pressure: short urgent knot-untie, breathing aftermath. Stable first-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "frayed coil... traded for a verse" advances prop/backstory/motif). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherent (ropes/time braids). Propulsion peaks in grotto murmurs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: motion-feeding beings + escape rope as time-lock map transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes. Slipknot game inevitable from ethical pattern; no derivatives.</comment>
