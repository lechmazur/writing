<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion culminate in earned endurance as whalebone bearer, with flaw of fearing empty hands revealed via widow's words driving final reverie; contradictory impulses (weave/steal vs. becoming fixed) act in the trapping scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hush density thickens and space curves, yielding resonant reconfiguration (RR/Charged Poise) when alignment calcifies thread with conceptual cost of suspended heart-support; orientation anchored early in valley/grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and lamp burner constrain choices by swallowing sound/light until shadow alignment enables release, charging final soot-marked palms image; sensory hush layers mirror internal trap perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to collect burdens escalates via boundary-less trap and thought-muting hush under accumulative lens, forcing agency in rotation that forecloses force-pushing option with visible cost in calcified frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of orientation over force emerges organically from particulars like drowned constellations to whalebone lattice, reweighting premise in final reverie image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (grief as kelp, patterns in spirals) with rhythmic modulation under stress sustains first-person stability; purposeful compression legible in hush-thickening beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or muddle; figurative language like "silence layered on silence" taught early integrates seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-weaver premise transforms burden-collection into geometric sorrow mapped via whalebone, with bold lyric risk heightening stakes in grotto trap without gimmickry.</comment>
