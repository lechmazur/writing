<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's preprocessing trait drives concrete micro-choices like sweeping the table and mapping drafts, yielding earned humility when dust spiral evokes pulsar glitches; grief redistribution as closure change forecloses tidy erasure with felt cost. Lupe's question forces admission without diluting focal interiority. Final student advice reveals values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust drifts build spiral pattern revealing leak ("spiral had thickened day by day"), enabling patch and straighter lines as tightening; CR closure in overlaid photos reconfiguring grief with conceptual cost of retained irregularities. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse (silt line, broken panes, seeping crack) constrains choices via drafts and mold, mirroring internal states through goal-directed action; recurring black plastic sheets charge final map image. Sensory hierarchy (iridescent flecks on palm) reflects scientific bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage/restore via measurement) tightens via dust pattern break forcing leak patch, narrowing options with time cost over week; agency in experiment repetition culminates in grief reconfiguration. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights personal loss visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of accumulative change emerges implicitly from dust patterns paralleling stellar cooling and grief shift, with final map ("change was not a headline but an accumulation") as resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like spiral avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with scientific perceptual signature ("preprocess reality into clean signals"); rhythmic prose modulates from observation to humility. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Lupe's "what a star scientist was doing"), advancing admission without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "grains creep as warm air rose"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("exhaling a small apology") purposeful, not muddling pressure beats like spiral emergence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star research and butterfly dust mapping transforms post-flood restoration trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via dust's irreplaceable mechanics charging CR closure.</comment>
