<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's heartbeat counting and relational dynamic with Lyle's ghost compel ink-drawing choices under bureaucratic erasure pressure; contradictory fear/solace impulses act in scene, with final renunciation earned by shard/ink causality. Interiority particular via "ribs still lift" and warm shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink density builds to defrag repair and heartbeat cessation as CR/RR closure with legible cost in "feels the room hold her gently." Orientation anchored early in observatory/snow/Mara's death error; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal dome, ticking drives, blooming ink constrain ink-pattern tactics and charge final snow-stars image; sensory hierarchy (warm shard/palm vs. cold drifts) mirrors fragmentation theme through Mara's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erase death error via defrag) signaled via shard/email, escalates accumulatively through ink spirals repairing data; agency in spilling/drawing forecloses denial path with cost at heartbeat pause.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Failure-wisdom theme emerges from shard/ink particulars, reweighted non-literally in "defragmenting... making space"; final image answers fragmentation premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Mara-limited POV with perceptual signature in ghostly images ("digital ghost stitched"); Lyle dialogue natural/subtextual ("first crack teaches"), rhythm modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, vivid propulsion ("dark lake bloom," "hard drives tick like small insects"); no loops/artifacts, syntax varies with pressure, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ink-as-memory code and bureaucratic ghost synthesize freshly; shard/defrag risk heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
