<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "felt vibrations as if they were sentences" and micro-choices like chipping mortar align with perceptive traits, compelling cataloging as earned endurance. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery beats, leaning toward poetic summary over raw conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (draft, diaries, tapestry) build pattern density to CR closure in "no one could set it back," with conceptual cost legible in pinning tapestry as futile repair. Orientation anchored early in silo library post-dreams; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo's concrete hums, smoke scent, and hearth constrain choices (follow draft, chip mortar), charging final dragon shadows and pinned tapestry. Sensory hierarchy perceptual (vibrations > visual); setting evolves causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping axis shift) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via diary alignments changing knowledge to foreclose reset option. Cost felt in realization's permanence; agency in probing drives under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of dreaming's absence reorienting world emerges organically from particulars (diaries stitching old map, new north plea); final pinning offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise via walls' persistent stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as sentences); rhythmic diction modulates from hush to crawling shadows, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in multi-job lines like "scaled shadows that crawled across the shelves"; figurative pattern (bronze dust, ember scales) purposeful without muddle in peak realization. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs pre-discovery, but no loops or scaffold dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream silo as wall-ear, dragons/tapestry reorienting axis via concrete perceptual history; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off inevitably at "stories turning toward their new north."</comment>
