<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (resurrection desire vs. craft limits) act in the quench pit refusal; final responsibility earned via name-dripping with embodied cost (tongue raw). Interiority concrete and alchemist-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: alchemical density builds to coin's "ELLIS" inlay as CR, reweighting names with cost (her lighter name fits mouth). Orientation anchored in opening lines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry's quench pit and gold-flecked clay constrain choices (scoop, mix); rain evolves causally, mirroring internal luminosity in final anvil image charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via balance) signaled early, deepens via Ellis confrontation narrowing options; agency in vial-sealing shows cost (sobbed name heavy enough).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of names' weight emerges via coin inlay and spoken lies; final "luminous regret sharpen[s] into responsibility" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct alchemical perceptual signature ("names heavier than metal"); stable first-person with rhythmic modulation under stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "drip a measure... feel my childhood loosen"); no loops, metaphors coherent and voice-motivated, rhythm varies for ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of name-alchemy and kintsugi transforms tropes; risk in "factually mystical" logic feels inevitable, heightens closure via irreplaceable coin.</comment>
