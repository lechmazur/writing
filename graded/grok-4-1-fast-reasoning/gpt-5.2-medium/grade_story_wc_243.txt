<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve small moments roots in concrete traits like tannin hands and past complicity in hiding Jun's truth, compelling her rewrite with embodied haunt after locket-fueled euphoria. Contradictory impulses act in scene via gentle confrontation of mayor. Final insertion of small-losses sheet earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of ink-sea motifs builds to conceptual repricing closure where torn page and new sheet reconfigure covenant with felt cost. Locket shard triggers meaningful deepening without causality breaks. Orientation anchored early; scope fits two-shard default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains via lodged locket and pulsing planks at end, charging final image; walnut ink, reeds, tide filter through archivist bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure (tide hush celebratory). Recurring jetty evolves causally to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truthful covenant) signaled early, tightens texturally via locket deepening knowledge and forcing mayor confrontation; pressure coheres to agency in reading aloud, with mayor's shake and page-tear as visible costs charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rebinding small moments emerges organically from locket, ink preface, and final small-losses sheet, reweighting "regenerated covenant" without statement. Resonance in sea smelling walnuts answers premise non-literally. Complexity lingers in town's haunted laugh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ink-paper-sea diction; rhythmic prose modulates from lyrical reflection to terse ceremony pressure. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven (Mara reads causes aloud). No head-hopping; voice particular to archivist idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors cohere (reeds like paper, sea of walnuts) without muddle in peak ceremony beat. Precise verbs anchor closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist rewriting sea-covenant via locket and proximate causes transforms history-ghost trope; small-moments ledger as closure pulses inevitably from particulars. Bold accumulative lyricism risks poetic density without obscurity.</comment>
