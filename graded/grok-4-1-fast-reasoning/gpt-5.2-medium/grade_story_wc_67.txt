<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of Lira's motivation to crystallize emotion, shown through contradictory impulses of fear and persistence in drawing amid inspectors; internal conflict with father's mirage of safety anchors micro-choices like careful truths spoken. Final realization of emotion in inspector's softened face earns her endurance with felt cost of ongoing risk. Flawlessly individual voice and flawed competence without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from setup to inspectors' intrusion, tightening via chair's groan into Charged Poise closure where rocking chair stops, inspectors leave, and Lira persists—reconfiguring safety's mirage with undeniable emotional cost in the final image. Orientation anchors immediately in gallery alley; one meaningful deepening suffices. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gallery's vanishing horizon and rocking chair constrain choices (pinning paper at convergence, draft as warning groan) and charge final image; sensory details like porcelain chime-breath and ash powdering filter through Lira's grief-biased POV. Micro-setting of chair evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Pivotal: chair's pause enables inspector flinch, proving indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of portrait under curfew/inspector threat signaled early, escalates accumulatively via incomplete clues to boots/inspection, narrowing options with chair's reversal; agency in unreadable mask and partial truths forces trade-off, cost felt in stranger's recognition amid peril. One tightening forecloses capture path, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ash-testimony amid safety's mirage emerges organically from particulars like father's envelope-ash and inspector's flinch-recognition, reweighting via final chair-stop and next-portrait start without moralizing. Resonance in "somber marvel" pause offers non-literal answer to goodbye's crystallization, inextricable from Lira's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of blurred truths and ash-stars; rhythmic prose modulates from calm powdering to terse inspector exchange, voice biased by grief (e.g., "safety was always a mirage"). Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden in Lira's "vanishing points" deflection. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "powdered black rose... night sky being made" advances action, image, theme); rhythmic variety peaks in chair groan sentence, propelling to closure without loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Zero artifacts; read-aloud propulsion flawless even under inspector stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash-portraits in vanishing gallery transforms tropes of resistance art and haunted objects into inevitable emotional crystallization; risk in porcelain-mask jaggedness and chair's agency heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious premise commits fully, no derivative echoes.</comment>
