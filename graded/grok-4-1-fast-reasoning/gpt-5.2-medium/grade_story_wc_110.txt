<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's embodied fear (lens "pressed her tongue") and contradictory secrecy/honesty impulses act in scene; final ledger signing earns change via prior decoding causality with relational exposure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: doodle pattern decoding because/therefore narrows sabotage suspicion to revelation; RR closure in lens-sharing and open ledger reconfigures secrecy with transparency cost on-page ("signed her name beneath it for everyone to see").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Forecourt crystals anchor and return to charge thaw image ("steamed gently"); lens as micro-setting constrains decoding choice and final array, mirroring internal states through purposeful selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mistrust stake signaled early tightens via pattern-deepening that forces confrontation agency; cost unmistakable in exposure trade-off charging board-meeting image under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Secrecy-suspicion theme emerges via doodle subtext and lens honesty; final transparent array non-literally answers thaw question, reweighting prior hidden route with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (ambiguous shapes as "maps and confessions") biases noticing; rhythmic compression heightens hush pressure without elision, prose as thawing mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "whisper... borrowed from breath" advances atmosphere/voice); zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figuratives charge without muddle even in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lens-decoded doodles transform silent-world tropes into fresh non-verbal plot engine; risk-taking hush-coordination feels inevitable, heightening stakes via irreplaceable perceptual ingenuity.</comment>
