<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's sanely eccentric precision—straightening spines by millimeters while plotting hyperbolic triangles on catalog cards—roots her curiosity in embodied contradiction, earning the shift from isolated listening to guiding patrons.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as scarf scent accumulates to measurements, pocket entry, and CR closure in "stories were not written objects but relations...in curving space," with loneliness cost legible in realized exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library's hyperbolic shelves and impossible-angle bookcase constrain her palm-rotation choice, charging the pocket's "river-and-coal smell" as discovery hub.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to locate stories' place deepens via diagram-guided press into humming pocket, foreclosing isolated precision with relational cost felt in guiding the insomniac patron.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Logbook's "coordinate of listening" non-literally reanswers memory-as-material premise, reweighting loneliness from closed system to open via pocket's analog echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—"each book had a pulse she could hear only in her lone corner"—sustains rhythmic control, modulating compression at "grain shifted...like a living proof."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms and coherent metaphors, peaking cleanly in "scarf tightened gently, reawakened by the contact" without loops or drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry concealing story-pocket via librarian's scarf synthesizes poetry/math into inevitable CR, risking bold conceptual architecture that heightens closure stakes.</comment>
