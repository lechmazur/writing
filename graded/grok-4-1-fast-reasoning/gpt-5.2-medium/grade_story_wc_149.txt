<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("joy and grief braided together until my chest hurt"); contradictory impulses in building resonator despite past abandonment flashes; final bead return earned by escalating resonance pulses, foreclosing self-preservation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of visits deepens revelations to orchard awakening; closure as RR (Charged Poise) in singing to match bead rhythm, reconfiguring debt with "empty name" cost legible in pear-eating tears; orientation anchored early in greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains via grafted trees needing resonance, copper/quince resonator from local materials charges final image; sensory hierarchy (frost on glass, soil brightens) mirrors awakening; endless night filters alchemical priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment to wake orchard) signaled early, tightens via bride's rest-costing visits forcing resonator agency; escalation deepens under accumulative lens to pulse-matching climax narrowing to life-note forfeit; cost unmistakable in fading smile and tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of completion over imitation emerges via bead/orchard particulars, reweighted in blossoms "smelled of weddings"; final pear image offers non-literal answer to debt's mournful elation without moralizing; subtext in flashes avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical diction ("distilled moonlight into sap"); sparse dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("You owe me," tender/sharp); rhythmic control modulates from hush to chord-sweat glass under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "roots ran like lightning" advances awakening); varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful lyric metaphors coherent without muddle in peak resonator strike; zero loops, no scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ghost bride trope via bead-resonance debt in night-locked alchemical greenhouse; risk-taking in accumulative hauntings heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early pulses.</comment>
