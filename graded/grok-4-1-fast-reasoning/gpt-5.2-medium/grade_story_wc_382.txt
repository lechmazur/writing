<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's drive to learn building language compels seal-stamping and document slip, rooted in grandmother's legacy and Ilyas friendship; embodied in clay-working attempt to match his nimbleness. Internal consistency holds without diagnostic labels. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from wax impression ("every groove shining") to parapet cracks forming sentences, culminating in RR closure via preservation order and Ilyas fade with conceptual cost of lost tutor. Orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop pots supply clay constraining revelation action; meteor light reveals wax grooves and crack sentences, charging discoveries. Sensory hierarchy (steam script, stone warming) filters through narrator's building-reading bias, mirroring internal quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to save Dovetail via building grammar signaled early (inspector walkthrough); deepens through seal-clay turn narrowing to documents, with agency in slip risking landlord burn. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as building's verb and lies buying truth emerges via seal-led history reveal; final "Ilyas...faded into the mortar like a word finally understood" resonantly reweights dead languages without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature ("masonry whispering," "read lintels") biases toward architectural signs; rhythmic diction modulates from lyrical steam curls to terse crack-following propulsion. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "meteors flared, and...wax looked like fresh mortar"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds propel to closure image unmarred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Linguistic mysticism of seals/clay/cracks synthesizes preservation trope into fresh, inevitable puzzle; risk of ghost tutor coheres stakes without gimmick.</comment>
