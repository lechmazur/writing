<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation to rescue arts roots in family baking and intensifies through micro-choices like mixing honey dough and offering the captain's initial loaf, earning the final confrontation with embodied dread ("sweet dread, like rose syrup turned sour"). Contradictory impulses act in scene via her historical narration amid fear. Final renunciation of passive guiding forecloses evacuation path with visible cost on refugees.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from routine loaves to thawing crisis ("slow drops tapping like a metronome"), culminating in Charged Poise closure where guards hesitate amid bread and scrims, reconfiguring options with felt cost ("mercy could also be tradition"). Orientation anchored early in grotto behind waterfall. One tightening via ice door thaw narrows paths without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto waterfall and ice door constrain choices (thaw via stacked loaves), while emerald lens charges final image by revealing scrim dates to guards. Sensory hierarchy (rosewater masking damp, honey scent evoking memory) reflects Maris's priorities. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal dread through mist-shivers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue arts/refugees) signaled early via Council's notice; accumulative escalation deepens through thaw ("light meant discovery") forcing confrontation trade-off. Agency in baking/thawing/offering loaf crystallizes stance, with visible cost in steaming loaves and damp boots altering tactics. Pressure coheres to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-bread/arts emerges organically from initials registry and thawed scores, reweighting premise in final loaf-breaking ("steam and rosewater rose like a warning"). Resonance from particulars avoids morals; captain's hesitation offers non-literal answer to history-vs-grief question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scent-biased noticing ("perfuming the galleries with rosewater") and lens-filtered vision sustains single POV stability. Rhythmic modulation heightens pressure (short sentences in thaw: "The door finally gave"). No head-hopping; voice reflects cultured dread idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "shaped huge initials for every family, and baked them until the crusts were dark as varnish" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies for ear. Purposeful metaphors ("musical notes, suspended like insects in amber") cohere without muddle in peak thaw. Minor fig density in opening dips propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bread-as-registry thawing ice/art via honey transforms refugee tropes through lived grotto logic and moral calculus (history for all). Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final damp-boots image inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
