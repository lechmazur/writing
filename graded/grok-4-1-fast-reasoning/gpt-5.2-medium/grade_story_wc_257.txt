<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's grief is embodied in shaking hands and pendants as "small coffin[s]," with contradictory impulses—lost faith yet crafting birds—acting simultaneously; final endurance earned as hunger loosens via teaching. Lysa and Sen apply crucible pressure without diluting POV. Blind spots (hunger for oblivion) compound until sprout verdict shifts stance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo climb to strangers arriving, tightening via Lysa's basil sprout as cadence shift. Closure RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page in final paragraph's "subdued ardor," reconfiguring grief with felt cost of imagined husband's caution. Orientation anchored early; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory's "brass instruments never tarnished" and "cool of all winters" constrain choices (curtains bend light), charging final image of low forge heat. Sensory hierarchy via Mara's jeweler lens (meteorite filings). Micro-setting (stencil lamp, pot) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief to purpose) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bird-led arrivals narrowing oblivion option. Lysa sprout forces trade-off (artificial survival vs. pure craving), with agency in curtain alignment. Cost legible in "hunger for oblivion loosen[ing]" before strangers' line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (bloom as craft amid "genuinely artificial" survival) emerges from particulars like opal ring etched with basil-constellation. Final image of "subdued ardor... steady heat of a forge" offers resonant answer, reweighting pendants from coffins to joined days. No moralizing; counter-reading (light into harm) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with jeweler perceptual signature (clasps as promises, solder metaphor). Voice rhythmic, modulating from shaken climb to charged poise; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Sen's "whispers like dust"). No head-hopping; diction reflects Mara's craft idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "curtains of intention... bend starlight into an answer, or into a wound"). Rhythm varies (short sprout stare amid long folds); no loops, coherent metaphors (sky in ring). Propulsion peaks in curtain corridor without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: origami birds + intention curtains transform grief/redemption via jeweler craft, risking lyric compression that heightens stakes. Final "keep the light from spilling into harm" feels inevitable from basil verdict. No template echoes; bold observatory premise commits fully.</comment>
