<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rian's warmly attentive trait drives micro-choices like harmonizing brothers' quarrel without preaching and mending drake's foot, earning final renunciation of perfection with embodied cost in ragged tail; contradictory impulses act in selective tending over grand fixes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from kite string snap inciting mends to closure RR in drake's tended foot and feather apology, reconfiguring incomplete beauty with conceptual cost legible in "ragged where the feather had been"; orientation anchored early, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon constrains via mangrove kite snag, net tear, reed drake emergence, supplying mending resources that charge final image; sensory hush and color "ink thinned with milk" filter through poet's flaw-seeking bias, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of affirming incomplete beauty tightens accumulatively from personal poem to brothers/kite/drake mends, narrowing to agency in harmonizing discord with visible cost in imperfect seams and bruised foot; protagonist endurance forecloses tidy completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incomplete emerges via frayed string-feather hook, stitched kite "sunrise pattern," drake mending, offering non-literal resonant answer that reweights prior discords without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in "world had missed a stitch," "light enter where fabric thin" stable in single POV; sparse dialogue natural, subtext-driven in brothers' softening; rhythm modulates from hush to laughter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful weaving metaphors advancing texture without muddle; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion; minor figurative density in opener integrates into mending pattern without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of snapped kite string woven into net knot and feather returned as apology transforms imperfection trope organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via recurring discords resolved in charged poise.</comment>
