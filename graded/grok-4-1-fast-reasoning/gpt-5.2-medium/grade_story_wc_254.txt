<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of contradictory impulses (cautionary songs vs. unrhymable hunger) revealed in micro-choices like paraphrasing the decree; final stride earned by brother's frozen name driving boundary dissolution. Soren applies precise pressure without overshadowing. Voice particular through poetic craft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from perimeter walk to mist-thickened silhouette, culminating in Charged Poise RR where Lira and shadow become "simply air" with conceptual cost of erased self-fence. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via loosening carvings suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz pillars constrain circling/tapping choices and charge final dissolution image; frozen lake breathes mist threading ribs, mirroring internal softening. Sensory hierarchy (humming soles, deepening blue) reflects aesthetic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boundary-striding for brother's reply) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via paraphrase-induced loosening and Soren's failed grasp narrowing to center stride; agency in three-story versions forecloses caution with felt relational cost (Soren recoils).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of paraphrase as boundary-crossing emerges organically from actions, reweighted in final breath-pattern where sacred lines guide rather than imprison beauty; resonant non-literal answer in air-becoming avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (lines making grief symmetrical, truth as moth-settling) biases noticing; stable close-third POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in legible closure. Dialogue subtextual, Soren's warning paraphrased to alter stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, rhythm varying from hush to thickening mist; purposeful paraphrase repetition avoids loops by advancing dissolution. Minor figurative density in climax ("lantern-moth hush" reprise) coherent but borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of paraphrase-magic dissolving quartz boundaries risks bold lyric fantasy, inevitable in hindsight from early motif; transforms cautionary tropes via aesthetic hunger without gimmick.</comment>
