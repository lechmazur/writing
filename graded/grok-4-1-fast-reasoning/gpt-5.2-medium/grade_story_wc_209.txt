<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quietly driven trait shown through sustained micro-choices like slowing steps and waiting for hush; final painting earned by causal build from postcards to window discovery, with embodied reckoning at "forehead against the cold frame."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density of clues (postcards, garden, etchings) to CR closure; discovery tightens pattern with legible conceptual cost in mother's etched confession reshaping bloom meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cathedral window layers constrain discovery choice and charge final mural image; sensory details like "midnight rustle" and "sleet tapped the panes" filter through Lina's priorities, evolving seasonally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mother's message via night blooms) signaled early and deepens accumulatively to window reversal narrowing interpretive options; agency in climbing during hush forces emotional trade-off, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Night bloom as engineered shelter emerges organically from layered discoveries, final painting reweights question non-literally as "tender dark" with mother's legacy as undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in botanical noticing (rustle, perfume); lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose as character in "umbral tenderness" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "vines so fine they looked like scratches on ice"); varied rhythm propels without loops or muddled metaphors, ear-test clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of etched-glass palimpsest mapping vents to blooms transforms inheritance trope; risk in mosaic seasonal shards heightens closure resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
