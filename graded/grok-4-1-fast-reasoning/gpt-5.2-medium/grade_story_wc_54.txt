<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete micro-choices like pocketing the sextant arc despite radio instructions; embodied stoicism in "hands shook from cold, but her face stayed calm" reveals hierarchy of values. Final redirection earned by prior discoveries, with competence balanced by struggle. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from sextant find to flow redirections, culminating in on-page CR: beacon sent reconfigures terminal as map of conserved hope, with legible conceptual cost in explorer's grief. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Lens holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (clearing glitter from drains, climbing ladders) and charges final image ("shadows of rails and staircases braid together"); sensory details like "stale air in sealed ducts" and engineer-filtered flows mirror internal states purposefully. Micro-setting (cistern, pipes) propels action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (demolition survey vs. resurrection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via discoveries narrowing to personal equations; agency in valve-opening forecloses wrecking with felt cost (shaking hands, ignored supervisor). Escalation coheres under lens but lacks one deeper reversal, entering 8-band firmly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of redirected hope emerges organically from flows/maze particulars, final image ("hope is conserved when it is redirected") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Sextant reprise shifts meaning earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: engineer notices "load paths and human paths echoed," syntax/rhythm modulates from calm sketches to rhythmic pump "coughed, then caught." Voice texture purposeful, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm ("small animal returning to a burrow"); metaphors purposeful under accumulative lens, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening ("maze of intentions") borders overwrite but integrates without harming propulsion or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering resurrection in spaceport maze transforms abandonment trope; sextant-building link and "hope conserved" calculus feel inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric build heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
