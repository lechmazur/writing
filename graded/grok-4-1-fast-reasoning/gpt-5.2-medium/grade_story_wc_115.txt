<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's skeptical interiority ("do not believe in absolution that arrives on a hymn") and contradictory impulses (snorts at chalk cross but turns wheel) compel higher-stakes entry and closure choice to confront Mara. Micro-choices under ghost pressure reveal values hierarchy with embodied cost. Final renunciation earned by prior causality, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: confession → wheel turn opens passage → ghost bay revelation → wheel reversal seals with note discovery as DC. Orientation anchored early ("tunnel under the old Barlow Mill"). Closure cost legible in "carry it into the world or drop it back into darkness" line, foreclosing silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tunnel's "wet iron and old coal" and dripping crown narrow perception and constrain choices; valve wheel as micro-setting charges final reversal image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (beads "warm, as if many hands had worried them"). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover swallowed truth) signaled early, tightens via wheel turn into ghosts forcing appraisal and note find. Agency in reversal narrows options with legible relational cost at closure ("stop her from hiding behind my silence"). Causal escalation driven by protagonist under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight emerges via radio patterns mirroring secrets, reweighted in note's "physical heft" and final call without moralizing. Subtext in ghost "accounting" and skeptical endurance invites ambiguity. Closure image offers non-literal answer to hiding vs confronting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness sharpened") and rhythmic modulation under stress; radio calls as voice-motivated elision taught early, paid off in psychic's "turn the wheel back." Stable first-person with no leakage, diction reflects skeptical explorer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("tunnel breathed, and a seam... sighed open"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor figurative density in opening ("eyelids click") without muddle in peak bay beat or closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dulling reversal image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptical exploration, radio psychics paralleling ghosts, and valve wheel unlocking "ghost shift" accounting transforms tropes organically. Risky supernatural commitment heightens stakes via appraisal method, inevitable in hindsight at note reveal. No derivative hedging.</comment>
