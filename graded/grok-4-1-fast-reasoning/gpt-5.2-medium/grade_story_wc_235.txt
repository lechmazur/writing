<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (jealousy of ignorance vs. gratitude for habit) act in dream swaps and lucid flights; final authorial choice earned by iterative dream-writing causality with visible cost of looped panic foreclosed. Interiority concrete and particular via feral nostalgia embodiment. Flaw of time-leakage drives struggle without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of shards (dreams, hikes, writing) tightens via pattern break (gratitude over jealousy), landing CR closure—"chose to keep writing until the dates behaved"—with conceptual cost of calendar puncture legible in final image. Mosaic shards taught early by dream chronicler frame; no orientation debt. One deepening (threads map breaks loop) sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll and body (shaking hands, bunk) constrain choices (guide pen, force nap) and charge final writing image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: sap/smoke evokes feral nostalgia amid confusion. Atmosphere tensions jaded wonder, mirroring internal leakages without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos into narrative) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dream density/loop break to gratitude repricing; agency in soaring/writing forecloses jealousy path with earned calm cost. Tightening at "thanked him for starting the habit" narrows options under lens. Minor swappability in hike beat caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of narrative as fence against time-chaos emerges organically from grave puncture, feral hunts, scroll-writing; final CR reweights premise (rumor vs. author) non-literally via "dates behaved," lingering ambiguity of scheduled endings. Resonance from particulars like body-swap irony, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (feral hunts, page-torn soaring) and rhythmic modulation (short stressed flights vs. breathing reflections) under pressure; stable first-person focalization teaches nonlinear pattern early, legible at CR closure. Prose texture as character: syntax fractures mimic time-slides.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (e.g., "pines stood like witnesses") without muddle in peak dreams. Minor density risk in opening metaphors contained pre-pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grave punctures calendar, leaking selves reordered by lucid authorship; risk-taking nonlinear shards heighten stakes via time-confusion constraint, inevitable in hindsight through scroll/image callbacks. Non-obvious feral nostalgia transformation elevates.</comment>
