<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied silence and fear of price, with contradictory impulses in recommencing weave despite orchard quieting; final mute endurance earned by causal buildup, as in pressing bead into cloth. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy with voice cost. No flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from silence/thread builds to puzzle-frame tightening and voice sacrifice reconfiguration at "silence pooled in Yara's throat." Orientation anchored early; closure Charged Poise with undeniable cost on-page. Experimental time elision taught and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard, bamboo, loom constrain choices (orchard fades beyond frame, bamboo footsteps signal return); bead and puzzle recur to charge final image. Sensory hush mirrors internal states through action. Micro-setting (loom, bead) pivotal without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message across distance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via puzzle discovery narrowing path and voice forfeiture; agency in weaving despite fear forecloses speech with felt cost at dawn knotting. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial connection emerges organically from weave/silence particulars, final non-verbal teaching reweights premise without moral; resonant ambiguity in ongoing "quiet duty" lingers. No preaching, counter-readings plausible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (threads/sliding strands) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from wistful hush to charged silence payoff. Seller's brief dialogue natural/subtextual. Patterned diction taught early, elision legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propulsion via varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (raveling silence to pooled throat) without muddle in peak weave/closure beats. Concision integrates image/action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Jigsaw edges as weave-map ingeniously transforms tropes of loss/magic into textured silence sacrifice; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risk of mute Charged Poise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
