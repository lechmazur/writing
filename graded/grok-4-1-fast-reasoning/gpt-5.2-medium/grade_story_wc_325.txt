<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobia's contradictory impulses act in scene ("terror crowded her ribs" vs. pressing forward), earning final endurance and cable fix through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain from codex fleck to phase transition culminates in Decisive Change (routing log) with claustrophobic cost legible in final surf-softening image; lens holds, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sea cave's tidal notch and collapsed lock constrain choices, forcing phase shifts; recurring gold fleck and coil charge climax and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Claustrophobia escalates via "gap no wider than her shoulders," narrowing options and driving agency in transitions; cost embodied in shaking emergence, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Standing by unremembered emerges implicitly from brother's log restoration; final "crashing hush" to "ordinary surf" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("gold fleck crawl," "world itself had loosened") modulates rhythm under stress, heightening immersion without slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "boil without bubbles, turning to a white fog" propels peak propulsion with varied rhythm and clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phase transitions and illuminant fleck synthesize fresh sci-fi cave quest; non-obvious method heightens stakes organically toward inevitable closure.</comment>
