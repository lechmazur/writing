<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Child's contradictory impulses—panic contracting world into box while curiosity seeks hush—act simultaneously during rope crossing, earning final lung-filling endurance with embodied cost of void exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to CR closure in jar-opening ("space around me felt wide enough"), reweighting fear with cost of measured void sips; orientation anchors early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Trellis ropes and niches constrain crossings/collections, while doll/object charges final wide-space image; tastes (pear, bitter tea) filter through child's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Claustrophobia stake signaled early tightens accumulatively at ropes via agency in breaths/method, forcing trade-off with legible cost in expanding mind/lungs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gilded hush as promise from scorched vines offers non-literal answer to fear-of-walls premise, reweighting silence via jar's wide space without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Child's perceptual signature—hush as "invisible fruit," void as "box"—holds stable first-person lyric distance, modulating rhythm with inversion surrealism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Synthesis of tasting silences amid gravity inversion transforms phobia trope organically, with hush from scorched vines risking bold surrealism that charges stakes/closure.</comment>
