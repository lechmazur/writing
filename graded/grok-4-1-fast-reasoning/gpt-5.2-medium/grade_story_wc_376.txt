<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via fern-detected lies and Mara's honest note amid water desperation; final clean-question choice earned by causal buildup of brother's fragments and conduit revelation. Fern embodies emotional contradiction without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (map piecing, hatch click, vellum bundle) deepen knowledge toward CR closure where Mara's note reconfigures lost-words premise with conceptual cost of exposed lies. Cost legible in "Sable held steady" clearing tubes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fern as micro-setting constrains choices (droops halt dishonest exchanges) and charges final image under toxic sky; conduit tubes with murmuring scraps vividly filter through Mara's priorities, mirroring internal states via purposeful sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover conversations/brother) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven discoveries under accumulative lens; one deepening (note's honesty narrows options, foreclosing lie-path) with felt cost in brother's panicked fragments and her admission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of candor composting lies emerges organically from fern reactions, note-clearing tubes, and final practicing question; resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on city's answerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (fern-monitored honesty, ink-ozone-rain scents); rhythmic control heightens pressure in conduit murmurs; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual (Rull's sorting greeting advances without exposition).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "paper scraps floated like jellyfish in slow currents" does image/atmosphere/advancement; zero loops, varied rhythm, no figurative muddle; read-aloud ear confirms natural acceleration to "city felt answerable."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postal dead letters as literal conduit composts tropes into specific world-logic (fern lie-detector, sap-arrow map); risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
