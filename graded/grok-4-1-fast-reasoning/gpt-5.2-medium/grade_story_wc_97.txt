<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via rhythm-pattern seeking and clock-carrying as proof of repairable time; contradictory impulses peak in hidden room where loop temptation meets goodbye chord choice, earned by prior causality with felt cost of releasing wife.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density (compass hums, clock twitches, film splices) tightening to RR closure in clock ticking and chord played; cost legible in "one chord he had avoided, the one that said goodbye."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arbor heartwood room and film-projected geometry constrain path to refuge choice; recurring compasses charge final calm image, filtered through Lio's musical perception without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hold/repair time vs. goodbye) deepens agency-driven via film-following to room endurance; cost unmistakable as "performance could loop until... decided to release it," foreclosed by encore chord under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of damaged time's repair via acceptance emerges organically from clock-film-compass motifs reweighted in final chord; resonant non-literal answer in "steely longing... turned into a strength," no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic syntax ("piano strings would hum in sympathy"); diction modulates intensity purposefully, eliding via film-map compression taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm mirroring music (e.g., "creaked like a ship"); metaphors coherent and sparse in peaks, propelling to closure image without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arbor-station and film-as-time-map transforms longing trope; risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via pattern payoff, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
