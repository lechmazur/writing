<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Keir's "consciously wild" interiority shows contradictory impulses acting in real-time during the ink portal choice and obelisk strike, earning the final resolve with visible cost in evaporated proof; embodied serene anger layers without therapy-speak. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy. Flaw balance via ink's unreliability adds struggle without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain from map scrap → ink whorls → canyon emergence → drone mapping → knife strike (DC), snapping time back; closure reconfigures stakes via note's CR with conceptual cost of unprovable truth. Orientation anchors early in encampment post-eclipse. No lens ambiguity or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy narrows to slowed dust/arrows in crisis, dust motes constraining movement; recurring ink pool and obelisk charge final spirals image, mirroring internal states through action. Spatial choreography clear across shards. Encampment/canyon evolve causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why time slows) signaled early, tightens via ink travel revealing obelisk profiteers, forcing agency in drone/knife reversal that forecloses passive observation with risk cost; pressure coheres causally to Charged Poise close. Moral calculus in choosing risk over flight legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of terror-for-profit emerges organically from obelisk reveal and unvanishing data tracks, final note/image offering resonant CR reweighting crisis rule-set without moralizing; recurring patterns shift from ephemeral to persistent proof. Complexity in calm-anger lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in slowed-time noticing ("arrows hang... sky syrup"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully, diction biased to tracker's pattern-sensitivity. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in portal transition legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pool accepted him without splash, folding him away"); varied rhythm accelerates in canyon snap-back, no loops/paraphrase or filter stacks. Minor figurative density in opening dips propulsion slightly but pattern-taught and closure-clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of ink portals, time-obelisk, consciously wild ethos transforms tropes into fresh causal engine; risk in ephemeral method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from map lead. Bold shard structure via taught pattern without gimmickry.</comment>
