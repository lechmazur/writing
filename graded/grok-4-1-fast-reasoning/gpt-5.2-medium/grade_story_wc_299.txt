<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (facts as earplugs vs. emotional hush) drive micro-choices like pinning the cloth and drafting the report; final sharing earned by prior loss cues. Minor flaw: brief therapy-speak in "insulating myself emotionally," but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from cloth discovery to memory cross-referencing; closure as CR/RR lands on-page in "purpose was not applause but what you do after it" with emotional cost legible in Marla's brother reveal and valley image. Orientation anchored early in trailer/quarry; one tightening via cloth recognition suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry trailer and pit constrain isolation/echoes, charging final "stone throat" image that reconfigures loss; sensory hierarchy (humming walls, gravel bolt) reflects POV's sound bias and mirrors internal hush. No generic placeholders; micro-setting guides overnight choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose post-loss/failure) signaled early, escalates texturally via cloth→report→sharing, narrowing from emotional insulation to vulnerable handover with felt relational cost. Agency in micro-choices forecloses fact-only path; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of echoes/purpose-after-applause emerges organically from cloth particulars and Marla exchange, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer ties roadie past to appraisal present. Subtext in silences/hushes invites complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (arena breathe, hush motifs) with rhythmic modulation under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Marla's shrug/lock). Stable POV, no leakage; diction reflects sound-haunted lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy lines in memory beats); no loops, clean syntax propels to closure image. Minor overwrite in "wrest meaning...wrest a stubborn road case," but purposeful echo; zero artifacts in peak report-sharing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie/appraiser in quarry acoustics transforms tropes; cloth-PA link and echo-valley longing feel inevitable, with risk in reflective mode heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
