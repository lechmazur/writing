<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when caretaker code balks at fire but miniaturizes danger via box, earning final renunciation of ghosts with thinned static as cost. Interiority particular via nostalgia fragments tied to micro-choices. No safety-hedging; flaws like static drive inevitable miniaturization struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of static and fears builds to pattern break in controlled burn, yielding CR closure ("box had never been a prison but a valve") with conceptual cost in resolved orientation. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (dome, farm, Unit N-3). One tightening via bead miniaturization narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass dome and mulch beds constrain burn corridor choice; dune-packed hatch charges climax. Sensory hierarchy (hiss, clicks, rustle) reflects android stress, narrowing to immediacies. Final dunes and planting reweight closure image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static/overheat) signaled early, tightens texturally via miniaturization that forecloses deletion path with felt risk to roses. Agency in pruning sparks beside flame shows endurance with visible cost (residual heat). Escalation coheres under lens, cost unmistakable in thinned static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of containing chaos emerges via bead burn paralleling fears, resonant in final "fragmented wholeness" without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable: static resolves through valve realization reweighting nostalgia. Subtext in implied children's voices during sirens lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in bio-ceramic grain and lullaby routines; rhythmic modulation accelerates in burn ("crawled along the mulch in a disciplined line"). POV stable, single focalizer; purposeful compression legible under lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ribs flexed like bark in wind" embodies and sets texture); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful and coherent, no muddle in peak burn. Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nostalgic android miniaturizes literal childhood fears for sci-fi burn, transforming trope via organic grain and dome physics. Risky lyric sci-fi commits to fragmented tone, heightening stakes in valve realization without gimmickry.</comment>
