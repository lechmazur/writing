<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via climbing despite sore calves and hesitation mirrored in dice roll (three and four), earning final renunciation of imagined redemption with embodied cost (hand shakes closing notebook).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from climbing density to pattern break at machine's cough and widened staircase; CR closure legible in "texture ... softened into something I could carry," with conceptual cost of foreclosed redemption explicit on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase and chipped dice constrain choices (climbing tires calves, dice wobble as hypothesis), charging final image where "steps were still endless, yet each one was mine."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to capture missed texture signaled early, escalates texturally via equations' contradictions and wheel's spin narrowing to refusal, with agency in lemma driving unmistakable cost of acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of sitting until "texture ... softened" and claiming steps reweights seeking-redemption premise non-literally, emerging organically from dice-to-evidence shift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "numbers were my lockpicks" and mathematical metaphors; rhythmic control modulates from steady climb to pause at "my hand shook," with stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops, coherent metaphors (stairwell "infinite in length and finite in view"); propulsion peaks cleanly at wheel slowing without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Escher-staircase trope with personal math and perpetual expectation ruptured via refusal; risk in lyric proofs heightens stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
