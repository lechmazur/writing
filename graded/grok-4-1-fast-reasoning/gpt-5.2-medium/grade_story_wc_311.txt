<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Heartbroken reaper's grief embodied concretely ("name tasted like iron"), with contradictory duty vs. warmth driving micro-choices like fingertip-naming; final endurance of softened fears earned via prior causal naming acts, foreclosing unnamed haunting with chest-loosening cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: voice density builds to crystal shards shrinking monsters, tightening to Charged Poise/CR closure ("crystal under the atlas page... fear can be charted"); orientation anchored early ("ancient observatory at dusk"); cost legible in "new names like distant intimacies that might outlive my grief."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirrors and beams constrain crystallization process, charging final tucked-crystal image; sensory hierarchy (brass/rain smell, scythe clicks) selective via reaper's bias; spatial choreography coherent as light paths evolve with phonograph play.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears to survive grief) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as naming shrinks inked leviathans and loosens chest; agency in angling mirrors/handling crystals forecloses unnamed terror path with on-page softening cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming sacrifice to chart fears emerges via particulars (whisper "Tell the sea I paid" lodging as caption); final sob-crystal under blank ocean reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hollow that grief has carved") biases noticing (light breathing page); rhythmic modulation heightens under naming pressure (short shards vs. flowing setup); stable first-person with no elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "syllables began to crystallize into tiny salt bright shards" advances plot/atmosphere/image); zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels to closure; figurative coherence (light bridges, lodged dust-names) taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper mythos with phonograph-light alchemy transforms sacrifice tropes; lover's lost art as constraint heightens stakes organically; bold lyric fantasy risks pay off in inevitable crystal-naming cadence.</comment>
