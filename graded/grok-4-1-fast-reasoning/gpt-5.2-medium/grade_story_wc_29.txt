<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (cautious hope vs. bold interference) acting in the wiring and switching moment; motivation intensifies through recognition of trickster signatures, earning her final explanatory handover with job-risk cost. Flaw balance: competence in decoding paired with genuine isolation risk. Final micro-choice hierarchy reveals values under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: argument-shifting beacon → recognition from logs → rewiring interference → lattice response and beacon slip as DC with felt pressure cost ("something vast had leaned closer and then hesitated"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene tightens meaningfully at 2:13 a.m. surge. Closure reconfigures options with undeniable cost in her exposed charts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spectrum analyzer and charts constrain climax choice and charge final image (handing charts aligns rift/tower/fault); sensory hierarchy (grit under nails, pounding door) reflects Mara's priorities. Ethereal grit atmosphere mirrors stakes without overt symbolism. Studio micro-setting guides subsonic routing tactically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit tricksters amid divides) signaled early, escalates via causal surge/pounding to agency-driven reply narrowing options; cost legible in "brutal in risk" and town softening with wary listening. One tightening (false map forces hesitation) driven by her choice under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder-weaponization via trickster opportunism, resonant in final realization ("tricksters...counting on humans") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in sky-nudging/bailed meanings; charged poise in town's wary listening admits complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (signal as "braided sound to starlight"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "hands steady despite the grit under her nails." No head-hopping; diction biased to astronomical idiom reflects expertise without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "rewired the broadcast chain, routing a tone generator"); metaphors purposeful/coherent, varying rhythm supports ear test. Minor overwriting in opening density (−0.1), but no loops/artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic signals as divisive bait countered by subsonic deception, transformed via charts/town fault alignment; risk-taking in quiet CR heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from log recognition to opportunistic reveal.</comment>
