<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete perceptual shift post-smell loss, with contradictory impulses in gentle intervention; final endurance earned by prior readings, as in screw's "reddish tarnish only on one side, like it had been held near a candle while a person cried."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of observations building to CR closure—"even without smell she could still unveil ordinary miracles"—with cost in loss reconfigured; two-shard structure seamless, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and water clock drops as micro-settings constrain perception and charge final image ("listened to the drop ring inside Maro's clock"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific, vivid economy throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humanize to unveil miracle) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepened readings narrowing to intervention; agency in delivery choice forecloses judgment path with relational cost legible in father's shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual truth emerges organically from particulars, final image reweights loss without moralizing—"a household remade by a sentence allowed to be heard."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("peering at messages through the shop's wet glass, through the loupe"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (fog as occluded view); rhythm propels via varied syntax, peak clarity in "Your hands held a life in place when time slipped."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anosmia into visual-emotive detection transforms disability trope; risk in lyric accumulative voice heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
