<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Serren's motivation rooted in sacrifice backstory compels collective change with felt cost in shared labor; collective "we" yields embodied emotion but dilutes individual contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density from chalk messages to relay activation; Charged Poise closure in promise and salute reconfigures family as practice with conceptual cost legible in "family was a practice, not a bloodline."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and thorns constrain relay work and charge final rising image; selective sensory details (chalk lines, windblown thorns, star-scented window) mirror internal states through goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reaching nebula tightens via revelation of Serren's logs, forcing endurance of doubt with thorn-scratched cost; collective agency crystallizes in final haul and promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of practiced family emerges from chalk orchestration and sacrifice habit, resonating in final image of bell-keystone and fading salute without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Collective first-plural voice stable with lyrical perceptual signature ("brambled hope, scratched and snagging"); purposeful compression teaches pattern early, pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety accelerates through work beats; no loops, metaphors coherent (e.g., "hand on your shoulder in a thorn thicket") without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk-ghost relay on levitating orchard transforms survival tropes; risk in collective POV heightens communal stakes organically.</comment>
