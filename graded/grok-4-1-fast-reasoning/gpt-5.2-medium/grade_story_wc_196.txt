<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines in embodied grief shifting "from a weight into a lens," with contradictory hope driving micro-choices like careful unfurling; final endurance of grief with "heart...moving" earned by prior discoveries. Josie's guarded eyes and trembling fingers reveal under pressure without stereotypes. Voice particular via archival precision in copying letter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust pattern to drawer to bundle builds density to Charged Poise closure with button on table reconfiguring Mara's grief and Josie's history. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in file room post-emancipation. One tightening via hidden bundle suffices; cost legible in emotional ripple starting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust patterns as recurring micro-setting constrain choice to Cabinet H, charging final button image; sensory rise of "smoke and river mud" mirrors war history discovery. POV bias filters via Mara's "tactfully hopeful" lens on absences. Spatial choreography clear from table to drawer to Josie meeting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hidden kindness) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via letter revelation narrowing erasure options; agency in Mara's persistent search forces Josie confrontation. Cost felt in guarded eyes trembling at Lottie's name, charging poise without resolution. Escalation coherent under lens to final ripple.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mercy refusing bureaucratic erasure emerges via button/letter particulars, reweighted in final "pebble that could start a ripple" without moralizing. Subtext in Mara's answer on sorrow/cruelty resonates non-literally. Protagonist arc inextricable from magnifying kindnesses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in archival noticing (dust maps, pencil scratches); dialogue subtextual—Josie's "why a soldier" pursues goal, Mara's reply crystallizes theme. Rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to tense unfurling; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "brushed off its skin of gray" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors coherent (lightning-cracked button). No loops/artifacts; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival sleuthing with Civil War mercy via button in foster files transforms trope; risk in lyric compression of history pays off in charged poise. Button's evolution from prop to promise feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
