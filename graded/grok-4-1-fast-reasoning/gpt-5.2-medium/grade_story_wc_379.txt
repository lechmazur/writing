<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove "listening heals" compels consistent micro-choices like following arrows and steadying hands on the locket amid sirens, earning the final clasp with embodied calm. Secondary characters like Hassan and Mrs. Ibarra apply relational pressure through admissions that deepen her curation. Internal conflict emerges subtly in courtyard flinches versus her imposed hush, shown not told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: locket clink accumulates neighbor stories via chalk arrows, tightening to brick keyhole discovery and mailbox opening as RR/Charged Poise with emotional cost legible in readings and shoulders dropping. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (Mara, courtyard, dawn). Single scene causality clear, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard's murals, fountain, and basil constrain choices—arrows lead through doorways/benches, brick seam hides keyhole charging climax. Sensory hierarchy (pigeon chatter, wind clinks) reflects Mara's discerning ear amid "sandstorm calm." Developer truck at gate evolves intrusion without static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock mystery via listening) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through story density and crowd gathering, narrowing to key turn at brick panel with siren/developer pressure complicating but not resolving. Agency in following/probing forecloses profit path (not selling locket) with relational cost in admissions. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening as key emerges organically from letter readings reweighting blackout fractures, final image of clasped locket and "new quiet" offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in silences (unspoken apologies) and irony (mailbox delays for readiness) invites ambiguity. No tidy binaries; developer lingers as counterpressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (discerning notices: clinks, seams, shoulders) biases toward auditory healing, stable without head-hopping despite crowd. Voice modulates rhythmically ("voices braid like windblown sand") under intrusion stress. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Hassan's unflinching name), advances via admissions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels: every line weaves sensory/character advance, no loops or scaffolds. Rhythmic variety peaks in climax ("mailbox door swings down with a dusty sigh"), metaphors coherent ("dry leaves" eviction notices). Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms mailbox trope via listening/community accrual, not confrontation; locket-to-letters synthesis feels inevitable from curation trait. Risky lyric calm amid intrusions heightens emotional stakes organically. Fresh "sandstorm calm" idiom anchors memorable voice.</comment>
