<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arin's esoteric realist traits drive concrete micro-choices like adding reeds post-wing discovery, with embodied emotion in the voice break revealing contradiction between permanence desire and transience acceptance. Final renunciation of frames earns closure with felt cost. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from frame-building to wing find to reed clack, culminating in Charged Poise closure where monarch passage and dismantling reconfigure transience with conceptual cost in "nothing would claim the sky forever." Orientation anchors immediately; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's thin soil and gusts constrain staking choices; moth wing and marigold cloth as micro-settings charge final image of cloth as "shy flag." Sensory details (moss drip, reed clack) filter through Arin's priorities without cataloging. Evolves causally with storm snaps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal monarchs amid thinning migration) tightens via wing revelation forcing reed adaptation, narrowing to one-migration success under Accumulative lens. Agency in rebuilding forecloses permanent claim; voice break makes emotional cost legible before monarch alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of honoring overlooked/transient histories emerges organically from names read aloud against valley denial, reed clack resolving cadence motif without statement. Final image non-literally answers premise: signals patch navigation for "one migration," reweighting denial with quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature (e.g., "knots were promises made with hands"); rhythm modulates from dawn builds to noon climax without slippage. Compression taught early pays off in closure poise; no withholding or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "pale fluttered... opaque as parchment") with propulsion; varied syntax/paragraphs flow read-aloud without loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak monarch beat. Strategic telling compresses histories efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly migration with technician ghosts via measurable omens transforms environmental trope; risk in lyric transients heightens stakes, culminating in inevitable "sky had listened" without gimmick.</comment>
