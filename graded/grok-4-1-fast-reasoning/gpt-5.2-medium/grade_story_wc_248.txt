<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in central chamber ("old arsonist... begging for flame, yet the archivist in her hands wanted preservation"), compelling earned choice to broadcast with visible cost in chest roar and shame. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied via blistered hands holding tenderly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from signs to cipher to reel, culminating in CR at "carrying the evidence to the capital broadcast tower," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of self-revelation. Orientation anchored early in ash flats; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tapestry fragment as recurring object constrains choices (aligns spiral, scrapes message), charges final preservation act; sensory details selective via POV (warm air from seam, lamps waking). Environment mirrors internal fusion of fire/love.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise without burning) deepens accumulatively through decodings, agency in scraping/copying/broadcasting forecloses arson path with legible cost in "throat with shame" and internal roar. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation over destruction emerges organically; final image "volcano turned outward... light the way home" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting fire motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns "in her ribs," analytical proofs); rhythmic control modulates intensity, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via image integration; minor figurative density in trail beats ("stubborn flowers of paint and wire") borders overwriting but pattern-taught without muddle at closure. Varied rhythm, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-trail quest and arsonist redemption via self-portrait fusion; risk-taking in accumulative pattern heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
