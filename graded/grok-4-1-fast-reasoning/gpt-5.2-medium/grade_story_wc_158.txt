<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shy insomniac poet's contradictory impulses peak embodied in shaking fingers and whispered apology before tearing the cherished postcard, earning her useful endurance with visible emotional cost. Interiority concrete and particular through unslept eyes and poetic drive. No safety-hedging; flaws propel unstoppable descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from blackening lilies to cistern ritual, culminating in on-page RR via postcard pieces sinking and root-hairs brightening, with legible cost in torn galaxy card and apology whispered to water.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shell's spiral ribs and Heart-Cistern pool constrain descent choices and charge final image of floating postcard reflecting stars. Sensory hierarchy (damp notebook, off-key wind, pearl-colored water) filters through Mara's poetic bias. Evolving lily roots mirror internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew armistice) signaled early via blackened lilies; accumulative deepening narrows to solo descent and tearing ritual, driven by agency with cost in emotional forfeiture of Iren's postcard. Captains' softened anger charges final image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of photosynthesizing pain into beauty emerges organically from lily metabolism parallel and Iren's tasted message ("Peace is a plant..."), reweighting premise in final blossom light rippling outward without moralizing. Closing image resonates as non-literal answer to war's threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (tides rubbing ribs, root-hairs like ink) modulates rhythmically under stress, stable single POV. Poetic compression taught early pays off in crisp ritual beats; diction reflects poet's biased noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; purposeful metaphors (kelp-dreams, blooded sea) cohere without muddle, accelerating to peak propulsion in "tore the card along the embossed map and sank the pieces one by one." Zero loops or scaffolds; read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater shell-city, living-petal treaty, and stellar postcard transforms tropes; bold lyric fantasy risks poetic density but heightens stakes via irreplaceable mangrove lilies' revival, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
