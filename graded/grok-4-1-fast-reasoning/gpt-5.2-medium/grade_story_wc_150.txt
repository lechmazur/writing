<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority in Liora's admission against the sundial base—"her faith had been depending on arrival, not on direction"—reveals contradictory impulses (trust in work over miracles) acting in scene, earning her final renunciation of leaving with visible cost in choosing persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to tremor interruption and chapel discovery, landing Charged Poise closure in sundial shadow "slid[ing] forward" with conceptual cost of accepting detours; orientation anchored early in valley/monastery; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots "sn[aking] between bones" and apples "smell[ing] faintly of incense" constrain excavation choices and mirror internal states via tactile action; recurring orchard charges final plinth image between trunks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of faith restoration tightens via tremor reversal, forcing reframe through wandering; agency in shoring/rebuilding shows endurance with cost in undone work and doubt admission; pressure coheres accumulatively to crystallize stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of motion amid interruptions emerges organically from notebook prayers and stopped watch, answered resonantly in "time could resume without erasing the pauses"; no moralizing, complexity lingers in Sava's softening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "drafts that sounded like pages turning"; rhythmic modulation under stress (tremor climb); Sava's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual; purposeful elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, e.g., "spade tapped skulls and stone"; no loops/artifacts; purposeful lyric metaphors cohere in accumulative mode without muddling peaks like tomb opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb excavation as faith's purposeful detours transforms tropes; risk in lyric wandering structure heightens stakes, culminating in sundial repricing interruptions inevitably.</comment>
