<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—secrecy from fear versus ritual risk to restore trust—act simultaneously in the vault setup and peak confession, earning the final handover with relational cost. Interiority concrete via embodied fear ("thin ice") and micro-choices like hiding then arranging codex. Team applies pressure but remains archetypal; Ilyon's Sava response reveals distinct flaw without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from secrecy reflections to ritual chords resolving in Charged Poise (new pledge, ink clears). Closure reconfigures trust with legible cost in "discord stung" and "poisoned the archive." Orientation anchored by ~50 words (archive, night, storm); single scene causality intact via vow→ink→tracing→symphony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vault's cedar oil, quartz lamp, and codex constrain ritual choices; ink well as micro-setting charges final handover image. Sensory hierarchy linguist-specific (scripts as scores, knotted lines). Details evolve causally (ink darkens/lightens); no white-room, purposeful over vivid breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: pledges darken ink, fork vibrates lamps, tracing unsnarls into harsh chord forcing confessions. Agency in Mara's ritual initiation narrows options; cost unmistakable in shared shame and exposed lies at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence versus promise-symphonies emerges organically via ritual progression; final "tentative melody" offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting secrecy without moralizing. Subtext in Ilyon's wince and Sava response adds ambiguity; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with linguist perceptual signature (dead scripts as scores, snarled words). Prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax modulating to "held breath" under ritual pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (pledges, Ilyon's admission); no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "promises had started to sound like paper in a fire" advances stakes/voice); rhythm varies for propulsion, zero loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful/consistent (ink as tear, knots loosening); no overwriting in peak ritual beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics, music-truth ritual, and promise-binding transforms tropes (secrecy, mentor rift) via Sava codex mechanics. Risk in ritual's discordant test heightens stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from established patterns, no hedging.</comment>
