<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sava's motivation rooted in cryptic belief shines through embodied actions like pacing until soles bleed, earning the revival; Mara's quick alignment adds relational crucible without depth loss. Minor slip: limited contradictory impulses shown acting simultaneously, mostly steadfast endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rhythmic density builds from solo pacing to group march, delivering Charged Poise closure when dust spirals and carrier folds paper amid felt costs of patience and blood. Orientation anchored early in Lumen Gate and ghost town; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archway and cobblestones as "ear" and "throat" constrain choices and charge final image; sound hierarchy (hush to resonance) reflects Sava's priorities. Micro-setting of fork and stones guides revival tactics purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring balance tightens accumulatively via growing procession narrowing abandonment threat; agency in rhythm-leading forecloses drift with visible costs like bleeding soles and decree morning pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via shared pulse emerges organically from footsteps unwarping shutters to kiln chiming; final wet fountain note reweights town-as-instrument without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature modulates rhythmically; sparse dialogue like Sava's riddle carries subtext naturally, distinguishing voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via sonic imagery; no loops or artifacts, figurative pattern (echo, hum) taught early pays off in dust spirals without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of town-as-instrument tuned by footsteps transforms ghost town trope; risk in cryptic method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at decree reversal.</comment>
