<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete embodiment (humming in bones, fractured voice as lullaby); motivation to cultivate sparks drives micro-choices like nudging switches and planting embers, earning the endurance against auditors. Contradictory impulses (personal sparks vs. company freight) act simultaneously without tidy resolution. Final multi-place confrontation reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost of constant care.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from patrolling to self-splitting across ledgers/dunes, culminating in Charged Poise CR as guard holds midnight open. Orientation anchored early (freight guard at depot post-forests). Cost legible in "constant care, like keeping a coal alive in a tin," reconfiguring options against collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glowing dune constrains choices (layered shipments dictate splits, auditors dull glow); chess clock charges final balance reminder. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (stray photons skitter, vanishing on blink). Details evolve causally (shack unfolds via tap), mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurse divergences vs. profitable collapse) signaled early, escalates via density increase under Accumulative lens: one tightening as clock-tap opens shelves, forcing self-split endurance. Agency in whispers/nudges forecloses single-history path. Cost unmistakable in clock's click and unending watch, charging auditors' retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of uncollapsed choices emerges organically from particulars (missing crate branches to orchard burn); final image reweights premise (midnight held open) without moralizing. Resonance from sparks-to-forests motif shifting via guard's actions. Invites ambiguity on hope's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (wave functions hum in bones, sparks skitter); rhythmic control modulates from quiet patrol to fractured multiplicity under pressure. Stable first-person with purposeful compression (walk shelves without moving). No elision issues; voice embodies dreamless cultivation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line layers archive/images); figurative language pattern-taught early (fracture/lullaby) pays off without muddle in peak (auditors beat). Minor overwriting in dune descriptions doesn't obscure closure. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh quantum-archive synthesis (dune as divergent freight histories) transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric multiplicity heightens stakes (self-split guarding). Final reconfiguration (multi-place charm) inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
