<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (past panic footprints vs. burning purpose) act in scene; final door-seed choice earned by prior micro-decisions like scattering at crossing, foreclosing forgetting with clutched notes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: doodle-seeds-prism linkages narrow to dial sorting; RR closure in chamber tremble and reverse threshold with legible cost (mist reclaims as notes escape).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto constrains every choice (viscous air, floating seeds to stair); prism bands charge final dial image, sensory hierarchy archivist-specific (carvings in light layers).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (patterns before loss) tightens via inversion hour to door unlock; agency in breathing alignment forecloses path with tremble cost, pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (vigilance vs. grotto's forgetting) emerges from seed-door payoff; final spoken combinations reweight premise non-literally as "shared resists silence," with conceptual cost in reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (light-sorting bias); rhythmic control modulates intensity ("water dripped upward," terse escape), elision (past) taught early and paid in memories.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density ("calcite softened, rippling"); propulsion peaks in inversion beats, varied syntax breathes with scene (short pulses vs. winding throat).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: inversion librarian harvesting passwords transforms trope archive into living grotto; risk (rule-bending physics) heightens stakes, inevitable in spiral-dial hindsight.</comment>
