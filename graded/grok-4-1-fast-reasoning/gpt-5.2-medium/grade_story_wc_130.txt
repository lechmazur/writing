<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Secretive conjurer's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like "tenderly furious at every equation that refused to balance," driving micro-choices from alignment to lullaby; final acceptance of unreachable brother earned via prior causality with felt cost of renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mosaic patterns densify to sequence of thirteen drops opening seam; CR closure lands in ladder-bridge touch revealing "reachable, though not retrievable," with conceptual cost legible in final repair image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cavern orchard's dew-glimmering apples and dripping stalactites constrain ritual timing and sequence; mosaic stone as micro-setting anchors choices and charges closure when Lysa repairs tile with quartz shard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love's continuation sans resolution emerges organically from spell-patterns and lullaby; final "buried optimism like a lantern" non-literally reweights math-of-emotion premise without moralizing.</comment>
