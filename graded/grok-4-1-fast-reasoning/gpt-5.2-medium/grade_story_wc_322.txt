<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fever dream architect's contradictory impulses—rational proofs vs. slipping memories—act simultaneously, earning the eruptive choice with embodied cost in "my proof lines no longer led to the exit."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to mirror yank, delivering resonant reconfiguration in "stable lattice" with conceptual cost of altered memories legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sinew threads as micro-setting constrain weaving/eruption choices; "painted shadows stood up like doors" and "sinew sang softly" charge final lattice image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of connection's texture deepens via memory alteration under textural lens, protagonist's agency in yanking mirror foreclosing rational exit with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final lattice image non-literally answers connection as "tension maintained," reweighting family loss into shared recognition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in architectural diction ("counted angle," "bridge that becomes a cage") modulates rhythm through pressure, stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in "threads snapping into new geometry" propels without loops or muddled metaphors; varied rhythm sustains read-aloud ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sinew webs synthesizing pneumonia, illusions, and connection feel inevitable; bold eruption transforms trope into fresh lattice payoff.</comment>
