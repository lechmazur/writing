<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in embodied contradiction—clutching dream as memory vs. future—culminating in earned renunciation at "chosen luminous absence." Micro-choices like scraping light into palette reveal values under pressure. Flawless single-POV coherence with no safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light-capture layers builds to CR closure in final photograph of "empty space," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of release. Orientation anchored early in library/docks. One tightening via silhouette suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archipelago whispers and sea-glass moments constrain choices (watchtower climbs, window light); palette/paper as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory selection (salt-stiff hands, foam ciphers) POV-biased and purposeful. Environment subtly mirrors internal absence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via hints to throbbing light to doorway release; agency in final photo forecloses clutching path with felt cost. Pressure coheres without reversals needed. Silhouette speech complicates, doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of longing-as-cipher emerges organically from light-layers and release; final "luminous absence" reconfigures memory/future without moralizing. Subtext in ciphers' effects on others charges resonance. Complexity lingers in release's oblique cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (light-skimming, whispering cliffs) modulates rhythmically; stable close-third POV. Brief silhouette dialogue natural/subtextual ("You wrote me back"). No head-hopping; compression taught early, pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: syntax varies, no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (light as heartbeat/palette). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene. Closure image crisp, unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photography/light-magic transforms loss trope; "paints with light" premise inevitable in hindsight, risks lyric non-causal drive payoff. Bold archipelago cipher elevates stakes organically.</comment>
