<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's steadfastness evolves convincingly from bravery to habit through embodied frustration and micro-choices like crawling after the fob, earning her final endurance; contradictory impulses act in scene as patience comforts amid unease. Interiority particularized in "uneasy sense of being watched tightened her ribs." Final renunciation of shouting for subtle chaos reveals values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: false starts because/therefore lead to successful recording via chain vibrations, tightening to clatter-induced chaos and retrieval at sunrise. Closure as Charged Poise RR: fob ensures father's safety, cost legible in "keep her father alive for another night" after risked exposure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pier micro-setting constrains choices (hush smooths treachery, pilings/chain transmit vibrations) and charges final image (tide rinses blood, gull cries). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: taps over words, mussels/splinters in crawl. Evolving details (lanterns rock like fireflies to blood on boards) mirror pressure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture betrayal sound) signaled early, escalates causally through three false starts narrowing options, agency in pressing fob to chain and knocking cups. Trade-off cost: physical peril (belly crawl) alters tactics, charges chaos peak. Moral calculus: expose without violating hush fully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of trust breaking emerges organically from vibrations in hush, reweighted in Lorne's oath and market's "first scream" via clatter; final image resonates without moralizing. Subtext in glances/coin clinks implies betrayal. Ambiguity lingers: hush as waiting peace or violence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: sound prioritized ("sound of trust breaking," taps spell certainty). Prose texture rhythmic, syntax mirrors tension (short amid chaos). No dialogue, but implied murmurs natural; diction grounds poetic voice in tactile details like "sweated tar."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayered (e.g., "lanterns rocked like tired fireflies" advances atmosphere/action). Rhythms vary (long setup to punchy chaos: "Pirates surged, blades flashing"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion peaks in crawl: "skittered loose, forcing her to crawl after it on her belly among mussel shells and splinters."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wax fob records betrayal vibrations in hush pirate market, transforming tropes via sound-as-evidence. Risky stealth chaos (cups clatter) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: false starts build to irreplaceable fob payoff.</comment>
