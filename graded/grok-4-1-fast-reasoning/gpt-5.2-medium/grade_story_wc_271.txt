<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mina's contradictory impulses—somatic panic versus deliberate return to the cliff—act in the drone buzz scene, earning her final tuck of the photo with visible endurance cost. Quiet talent shown translating under stress without raised voice. Minor therapy-label slip in "somatic markers," but embodied via palms/knees/copper taste.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: buzzing triggers freeze (inciting), photo-sharing deepens stakes, windbreaks and gull stillness deliver Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "promised to return tomorrow to translate, to breathe, and to keep growing in public." One tightening suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cliff arboretum constrains via salt/wind (necessitating reed mats), lighthouse lens charges stillness moments and final fog image. Sensory selective (buzzing sharpening, light pooling). Mirrors erosion/growth without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (realism amid triggers) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at drone confrontation narrowing escape option. Endurance agency forecloses inland move with public growth cost. Pressure coheres to final gull mis-shadow beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of measured growth despite erosion emerges via saplings paralleling Mina's needs, answered non-literally in dated labels and photo box under cypress. Reweights premise: realism admits "not every shadow carried a missile." No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: grief named "without raising her voice," somatic bias in noticing. Dialogue natural/subtextual (to teen: "some sounds were not neutral"; to Harlow: unfolds photo). Rhythmic control modulates panic to poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short panic sentences to flowing final image); no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful ("salt wind braided," "pearl of stillness") without muddle in peak drone beat. Propulsion clear through action integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh PTSD-botany synthesis: hobby drone as strike echo amid transplant shock warnings transforms trauma tropes. Quiet risk in public endurance closure feels inevitable from cliff arithmetic. No derivative hedging.</comment>
