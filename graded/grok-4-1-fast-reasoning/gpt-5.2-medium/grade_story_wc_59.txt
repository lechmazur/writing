<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in hypothesizing aloud to steady quaking heart while thrilling at gears' discord; final choice to unguarded Cradle earned by causal trail from vats to assembly, foreclosing mechanical symmetry with felt bittersweet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vats trail to Cradle assembly; Conceptual Repricing closure on-page as pigments release reweights genesis with erasure cost ("requiem for what was gone"), persistent egg constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring egg as micro-setting constrains choices (lifted, nested) and charges final image (pigments cling); cavern-suspended palace pressures descent, sensory hierarchy via POV (hypothesizes dust, prophecy in creaks).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake signaled early (reawaken beauty); agency-driven deepening via assembly narrows options under Accumulative lens, cost unmistakable in automata slowdown and erasure confession charging final palace creak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of blooming windows and rosy cheeks offers resonant answer to flawed genesis, reweighting mechanical symmetry via accident's refusal without moralizing; emerges organically from egg's bittersweet theft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in hypothesizing (e.g., "dust chose corners"); rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short sentences at hatch: "The egg shook"); stable single-POV, nun's sparse speech subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "seam opened... memory" integrates action/image); varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (palace "chandelier"); minor figurative density in opening fits taught lyric texture without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical world and egg-as-error theft transforms prince trope; risk in quaking lyric voice heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via assembly releasing uncopyable pigments.</comment>
