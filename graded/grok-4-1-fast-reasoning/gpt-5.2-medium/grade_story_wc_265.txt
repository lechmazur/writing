<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (hum in ribs, teeth tingle); micro-choices under pressure (placing gear under tongue) reveal hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses (fear of magnets vs. follow hum) act simultaneously, earning final renunciation of verification belief. Flaw of avoided fears compounds via translocations, confronting at crank with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via translocation pattern taught early, one tightening to cathedral via willed sleep-travel. Closure as RR/CR legible—"unravel the argument I had lived by" marks before/after with conceptual cost (belief loosens, tears reasonable). Gear under tongue motivates final act; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest vivid/selective (sheet-brass leaves, oil stream), sensory hierarchy via POV (wind chords as instruction). Constrains choices (wakes match fears like cog-bridge); cathedral gears/roots charge final image, reweighting wind from metal to rain-on-skin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover mind vs. rusting habits) signaled early, escalates via pattern-deepening under Accumulative lens (translocations reveal fears, method refines to hinge). Agency in following hum/method culminates in crank-turn, foreclosing self-verification path with on-page cost (tears, timbre shift).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of frontier-sense beyond borders emerges implicitly from particulars (fears visualized in machinery, crank with name). Final image (gear clicks home tenderly) offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting verification premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (wind as logic/paradox/laughter); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short sentences in translocations). Stable first-person focalization; purposeful compression in sleep-transitions legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (long descriptive swells to crisp "clicking home"). Figuratives purposeful/patterned (wind chords), propelling without overwriting; closure image sharpened by concrete tactility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanical rainforest as mind-map, sleep-unraveling via gears/wind transforms introspection tropes. Risky mosaic shards heighten stakes coherently; crank-etched name inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
