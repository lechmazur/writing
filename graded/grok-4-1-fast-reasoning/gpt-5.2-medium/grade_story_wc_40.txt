<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scholar's reticence yields to fractured testimony and softened responsibility in corridor, earning final plea through contradictory impulses (scold vs. duty); embodied via hands on crystal and anger-to-map shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sequence shards building to CR closure (hush as cradle, crystal echo revealing door); pattern taught early, cost in responsibility legible at "my anger softened into responsibility."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library vines, chandelier crystal, and dawn light constrain choices (echo-mapping, door unlock) and charge final image (crystal tap brightens door); sensory hierarchy (cold tear, damp earth) reflects scholarly bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth vs. blame) deepens accumulatively through sequences, narrowing to testimony reweighting; agency in entering corridor and plea, cost felt in foreclosed scolding and plea-risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unbound language emerges via vine-translation and root lexicon, resonant CR in final echo without moralizing; Lysa's "translating" shifts invasion motif organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (marginal voice, sonic metaphors) modulates poetically under testimony pressure; Lysa line distinct and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels sequences; minor metaphor density in opening ("night like ink") risks slight overwrites but coheres without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-greenhouse and sonic-crystal mapping transforms language decay trope; risk in fractured testimony heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via root lexicon reveal.</comment>
