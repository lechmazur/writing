<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots deeply in curiosity and family lore, driving micro-choices like daily inquiries to the cameo and night walks; interiority shines in embodied contradictions like fear turning to wonder amid silence. Flaw: epiphanies like the mirror "filing time" feel slightly unearned without more simultaneous impulses acting in scene, though closure renunciation carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as anomalies layer density ("tags for trees not yet measured, already written") to CR closure: Mara writes note and replaces cameo, reweighting her as ancestor with conceptual cost of eternal complication. Nonlinear pattern taught early via logbook reordering; orientation anchors who/where/when by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Astral orchard and bathroom mirrors constrain choices (night walks reveal child laugh; mirrors trigger breakthroughs) and charge final image (logbook as archive). Sensory details selective/POV-biased: star-fruit falling upward mirrors disquiet; no white-room, vivid economy throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock nonlinear inheritance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via out-of-sequence events narrowing options to trap realization; agency in inquiries/writing forecloses "steer timelines" path with felt cost of becoming archive guardian. Minor slip: no single sharp reversal, but deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance as clean guilt-eraser emerges organically from particulars (cameo swap, backward heirloom); final CR reweights premise—history honest only if complicated—without moralizing, resonant via grandmother's cameo eyes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (philosophical lens on blossoms/mirrors); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens. No dialogue; voice distinct, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image clusters; metaphors coherent ("trees wore constellations like fruit"). Minor artifact: occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., reordering motifs restated adjacently) dull two mid-beats, but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi orchard and temporal inheritance via pistachio cameo transforms tropes; risk of nonlinear structure pays off in CR, inevitable hindsight via early logbook frame.</comment>
