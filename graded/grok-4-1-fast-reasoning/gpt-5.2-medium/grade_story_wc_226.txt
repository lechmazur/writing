<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's defiance and motivation root in concrete traits like ink-stained fingers and the "single truth in her throat," driving micro-choices like the antler doodle and broken-name poems; final renunciation of art earns stasis with embodied cost in color loss. Contradictory mischief enables Jalen's aid without flattening stakes. Secondary characters pressure via crowd chorus at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo climb to midnight poetry crowd to dawn chorus accusation, tightening via refracted truth embedding; RR closure lands in prism-cracking and color loss as felt cost, reconfiguring options. Orientation anchors early in canyon/bone towers. One deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bone towers, endless echoes, and pale spire constrain choices—echoes enable truth refraction, spire hosts ritual/prisms charging final rainbows-to-plain-morning image. Sensory selection (chalk/resin hands, lantern light) biases through Mara's artist lens, evolving causally from hush to humming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract truth for forgiveness) signals early, escalates accumulatively via poetry embedding name to crowd chorus narrowing options; agency in sessions and surrender forecloses art path with on-page cost (ink poured, prisms cracked, colors gone). Climax lunge tests commitment visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of refracted truth outliving artist emerges organically from poetry/echoes/prisms, reweighted in final image of colorless smile on bone tower without moralizing. Subtext in broken stanzas and surrendered weapon avoids binaries, lingering via cost-paid ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with artist-perceptual signature (paint metaphors, light refraction); voice rhythms modulate from hushed lines to humming chorus, distinct in sparse dialogue like Jalen's snort. No head-hopping, diction fits mischievous defiance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "words split, refracted, and returned altered"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts in peak accusation/renunciation beats despite lyrical density. Minor metaphor pile in opening yields to propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist-truth refraction via canyon echoes/poetry transforms tropes organically; risk in mischievous embedding leading to earned stasis heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via prisms' scatter to colorless end.</comment>
