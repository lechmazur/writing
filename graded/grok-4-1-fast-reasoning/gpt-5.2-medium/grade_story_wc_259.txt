<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in "I should have stopped, but the forbidden knowledge...promised an answer," earning the self-purification with embodied tears as cost; interiority particular via orchard scent and pulled-tooth joy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as irregular rotations densify light-scenes to CR closure (self-purification reconfigures dread/love); orientation anchored early in archive descent; persistent pagoda constraint shapes tactics to final slate reveal with tear-cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pagoda facets constrain rotations and charge final flower-opening image; vault's copper-stone air embodies nostalgia atoms mirroring internal states through goal-action; sensory hierarchy (scent, light) selective via historian bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge via patternless purification) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as beams thicken to council visions narrowing options; agency in habit-breaking forces trade-off, cost felt in tears and foreclosed innocence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Memory-as-weapon theme emerges organically from nostalgia atoms binding records, reweighted non-literally in spiral-teaching finale without moralizing; anguished joy layers complexity via Keth contagion/cure irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (atoms cling to ink/bone/breath); rhythmic modulation accelerates in rotations ("quarter, then a seventh, then not at all"); stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "light corridors thickened...council deciding"); metaphors cohere around prismatic nostalgia without muddle; zero loops, varied syntax breathes with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of nostalgia atoms + patternless purification feels inevitable; bold irregular-sequence risk heightens stakes, transforming archive trope into self-repricing freshness.</comment>
