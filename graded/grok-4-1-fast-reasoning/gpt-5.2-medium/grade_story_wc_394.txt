<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's steadily curious trait drives secret examination of arrow tip and transliteration, with contradictory impulses in scorning destiny yet bowing to waves and obeying "poetry pretending to be math," earning final embrace of silent dare.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from arrow glyphs via kaleidoscope to algorithm-guided flight and coast socket activation as resonant reconfiguration (CR), with conceptual cost legible in "tossing a pebble into time and hearing it never land."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Acid sea and mist constrain glider tactics, dead coast socket charges closure; gears "spun in sympathy" with launch integrate setting into action, mirroring discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fulfilling yearning algorithm escalates accumulatively through transliteration, bell reveal, and ribbon-following flight, with agency in leans costing self-laughter and obedience, reweighting into future dare.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of evolving yearning emerges organically via algorithm rewriting for "unborn species," with final image of glimmering towers offering non-literal resonant answer, reweighting silent bell's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in lines like "irreverent awe tugged her forward, the way a joke can make you kneel if the punchline is the universe"; brief dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; varied rhythm propels via integrated images like "hot wind that smelled like pennies," no figurative muddle in peak flight/closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yearning algorithm from etched arrow evolving silently across time transforms tropes into conceptual dare; risk in irreverent tone heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via coast payoff.</comment>
