<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's brazen calm embodies contradictory impulses, daring her aching chest while climbing ladders, earning her endurance and final gathering choice with visible health cost. Interiority concrete via diary specifics; flaws like ignoring monks initially compound into earned communal shift. No stock phrasing; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to channels discovery ("traced with fingertips") tightening remodel stake, culminating in CR closure via orchard reorganization and seed pods proof with Mara's death cost legible in final image between pillars. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices. No ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pillars' channels and copper arches constrain remodel choices and charge final humming arches image, mirroring internal states through tactile tracing and sweating stone evolution. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (botanical priorities); spatial choreography coherent. Micro-setting (seed pods) reweights nursery secret.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (foster respect pre-death) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via complaints opposition and reorganization deepening, forcing endurance agency with chest ache cost and foreclosed quitting path. Monks' resistance tests commitment; final gathering crystallizes stance under lens. Cost unmistakable in "remaining weeks" and lying down.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies pacts emerges via particulars like crabs under arches, reweighted in seed pods nursery and gathering promises without moralizing. Final image non-literally answers human interruption question, charging CR with communal cost. Subtext in diary readings avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in systematic observations ("which fig fed which gull"); diction/rhythm modulates pressure (short daring sentences amid calm). Monks' dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing via diary rebuttal. No head-hopping; elision of build details purposeful for accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "copper wire... sense the same currents"); varied rhythm accelerates remodel dawn work without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (veins guiding blood); no overwriting, filter stacks, or drift in peak beats like prying flagstone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living architecture speaking to non-humans via copper conduction and crab paths transforms tropes organically. Risky species-focus heightens stakes; final seed pods turn inevitable from diary particulars. No derivatives; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
