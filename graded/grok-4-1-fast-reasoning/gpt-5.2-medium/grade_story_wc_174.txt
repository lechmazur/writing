<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ilya's interiority shines in embodied realizations like editing pain erasing consent during alphabet reversal, with contradictory impulses in stealing/borrowing voices resolved by the napkin contract. Mara applies pressure as a foil, forcing the stung clarification of boundaries. Final change earned via prior causality, confronting flaws with relational cost in shared performance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mosaic shards (dome, bar, final dome) taught by early reversal pattern hold Accumulative/Textural lens to RR closure in passing the stick, reconfiguring consent with earned serenity as felt cost: "serenity... softened into something earned." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; one tightening via puppet reversal narrows ethical options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome as micro-setting constrains epiphanies ("breath echoed... meteor hush") and charges final image with shadows on curved walls. Sensory selection POV-biased (calligrapher notes puppets, ink); spatial choreography clear across shards. Recurring "hush" evolves with pressure, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant ethical stake signaled early post-argument, deepens via reversal beats under Accumulative lens: puppet plot unsteals harm, forcing contract trade-off. Agency in carving questions and offering stick forecloses borrowing path; costs legible in Mara's veto sting and smudged line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of consent in storytelling emerges organically from reversal motif, reweighted in final passing of stick without moralizing. Subtext in silences (Mara's tremor) and images invites ambiguity on power. Protagonist arc inextricable from ethical calculus, resonant answer in communal performance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: calligraphic lens ("reverse... from flourish back to bone"). Dialogue subtextual ("You reversed the story") pursues goals; rhythmic prose modulates from serene hush to charged hush. No head-hopping, diction biased to arts scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm ("hush" pattern taught early); syntax varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in dome ("obedient puppets") purposeful, not overwriting. Closure image clear, propulsion intact through shards.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphic reversal and puppet unstealing transforms ethics trope, risk in backward narrative heightens stakes. Irreplaceable dome-puppet-stick arc feels inevitable; no template echoes, bold mosaic commits to premise.</comment>
