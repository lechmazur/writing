<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Milo's analytical traits drive micro-choices like rigging the board and spotting footprints, earning the rescue integration; lightly attentive scanning reveals character under pressure without stock phrasing. Internal conflict subtle in balancing calculation vs. instinct, but embodied in sharpened attention at "His light attention sharpened." Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses caps below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: bishop roll therefore story therefore watch's roll therefore booth discovery therefore rescue; one tightening at trapped boy suffices. Closure as Charged Poise in "arrange little gates for chance to walk through," reconfiguring serendipity premise with felt tide risk cost on page. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal arcade under stars constrains choices, with rising water pressuring rescue ("water already seeped under it in cold threads"); sensory details selective via Milo's bias. Recurring bishop as micro-setting charges final image. Spatial choreography clear through arcade to booth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrated serendipity signaled early tightens causally at boy trapped, narrowing options; agency in bishop-as-wedge forecloses delay with on-page cost. Escalation driven by protagonist under causal lens; visible price in tide risk alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ordering randomness emerges organically from rigged board to rescue reprise, reweighting premise in final image without statement. Bishop motif shifts from compass to wedge, charging closure; ambiguity lingers in "sometimes that was enough."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with Milo's perceptual signature ("diagonals were how you slipped past boredom"); voice rhythmic and biased. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("let it tell me where you want trouble to happen"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors cohere ("voice braid with surf") without muddle in peak beats. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks; rhythm varies, sentence variety supports tide urgency at rescue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess bishop as serendipity tool in tidal arcade transforms tropes; multi-use (roll, wedge) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in calculated rigging heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
