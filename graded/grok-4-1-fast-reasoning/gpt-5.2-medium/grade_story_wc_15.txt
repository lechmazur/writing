<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ila's haunting optimism acts in contradictory impulses—honoring precedents versus sewing amid ruin—earned through brother's sleepwalk cue, culminating in altar discovery and communal mend with visible cost to silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of threads/paths to CR closure in final image of children walking stitched route, reweighting ruin with reverence cost; orientation anchored early at wharf, one continuous arc fits scope despite reflective density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Red canyon labyrinth and orchid-dyed threads constrain choices (ankle-height stitching guides sleepwalkers) and charge final cleft-door image; sensory selection (kelp salt, sucking pop) reflects weaver's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ruin to reverence) signaled early tightens accumulatively via sleep paths and altar reveal, forcing trade-off of precedents with legible cost in town's curdling silence turned songs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reverence as sewn path emerges organically from particulars (nets across gaps, plate-window), final image resonantly reprices broken precedents without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with weaving syntax/rhythm (overlaps, threads seeking needle) stable in third-limited POV; perceptual signature biases toward orchid solace amid grief, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated images (orchid throats dyed spools), minor metaphor density in reflective blocks but coherent without loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sleepwalking-weaving synthesis transforms labyrinth trope into fresh covenant mend, inevitable hindsight from plate's shifting paths; risk of communal dreaming heightens stakes organically.</comment>
