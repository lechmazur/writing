<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's affectionate skepticism drives contradictory impulses—hugging Jory while demanding somatic proof—in concrete micro-choices like the movement test, earning her final renunciation of the buyout. Blind spots (doubt vs. belief in people) compound into discovery without tidy epiphany. Internal voice coherent and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from Jory's test to tunnel discovery to exhibit/protocol, with CR closure in Mara's realization ("pathways were not only streets but choices") reweighting premise via refusal cost (hiding photos, agents' threats). One tightening via muscovite-split lattice narrows skepticism. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Muscovite sliver as micro-setting constrains choices (splits lattice into forks matching tunnel) and charges final image ("willowglass hope"). Sensory hierarchy (ozone, sizzling cables, tingling skin) filtered via Mara's priorities, vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography clear in studio/darkroom tests.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate pathways vs. recall/erasure) signaled early, deepens texturally via somatic lattice proof forcing tunnel risk and exhibit. Agency in devising test/protocol forecloses paths (hiding photos) with felt cost. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens, one decisive intensification sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden patterns as choices emerges organically from lattice/tunnel/exhibit, resonant CR in final image ("listen for paths") reweighting pill premise without moralizing. Subtext in affection under threat (hugging lawyer). Complexity via skepticism's endurance, no false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical texture distinct in perceptual signature (light fractals, somatic tingles), rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences in tests). Single POV stable, no leakage; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("did not matter"). Experimental compression taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/stakes, no loops (motifs purposeful). Rhythm varies (long exposures mirror fractals); minor figurative density in opener purposeful. Clean mechanics, no artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: somatic telepathy maps via light painting/muscovite transform tropes organically. Risk in fractal protocol refusal heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from particulars, no template echoes.</comment>
