<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely in "lungs tighten" and sky-recalibration; contradictory curiosity bridled by measured steps compels final compass-planting despite shaking hands, earning mentor's release as reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density buildup from organ-guided steps to corridor snap; on-page closure plants compass point in "tightest seam," releasing mentor with cost in his transparency and protagonist's tremor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nexus constrains choices via hinged walls and sliding floors; recurring stars/void charges final widening night image, mirroring internal rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spatial pressures accumulatively tighten stake to uncover key, deepening via lock-spin and mentor's rib-like prison; shaking hands and path stabilization show agency-felt cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consent as key emerges implicitly through gaze-transfix and named erased places; final "stable path back" reconfigures map-tyranny with lingering ambiguity on changed home.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person texture biases perception to sound/sky amid mutiny; voice compresses under stress ("fear was only another measurement") while holding perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms and integrated figures like "doorways voted"; minor elevation in "spatial mutiny" metaphors risks overwriting but stays legible to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny transforms quest trope into consent-driven geometry; compass-drafting risks surreal payoff, synthesizing to inevitable "cracking the prison" with hindsight freshness.</comment>
