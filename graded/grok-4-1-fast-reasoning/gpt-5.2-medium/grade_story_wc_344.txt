<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and embodied guilt ("guilt tasted like saltwood") propel micro-choices like rejecting theft for crafting; contradictory impulses peak when prophecy reframes taking as misalignment, earning the final renunciation with visible effort cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to prophecy vision ("corridor showed her father's bench") to gear-making CR, reweighting theft-taboo with conceptual cost of true alignment legible in library's dimming glow and single path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mirrors constrain search by multiplying/disorienting paths and charging closure vision of father's bench; frost-lace locks and iced table enable/disable via eclipse trait and oil, with body (sparkling lashes) as micro-setting mirroring internal repair quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn repair without theft) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via note/prophecy forcing renunciation; agency in filing new teeth forecloses stealing with felt crafting cost, though external pressure remains atmospheric over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Repair-as-alignment-not-theft emerges organically from prophecy scraps and gear-making, resonant CR in final image ("new timing in her hands") reweighting initial guilt without moralizing; mirrors' shift echoes thematic tide of pause/pull/let-go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (locks "sighed open," pulse vs. gear teeth); rhythmic modulation heightens realization ("brightness dimmed to a gentler glow"), no elision issues under taught poetic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery ("vial of warmed oil...lock sighed open"); minor figurative density ("sunlight ground into powder") purposeful but risks overload in opening, no loops/artifacts dulling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eclipse-locksmith premise synthesizes fresh fantasy logic (shadow-shifting keyholes, prophecy gears) with emotional repair arc; risk in mirrors' active reconfiguration ("rearranging reflections") heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
