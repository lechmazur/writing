<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory grief impulses act in scene via failed cranes and self-splitting choice; final renunciation of wholeness earned by prior micro-choices like gem polishing. Interiority particular (hands forget laughter's weight). Flawless under single-POV pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from recordings to spire projection, closure as RR (Charged Poise) with legible cost in "flame and paper" split. Orientation anchored early (Mira in tea garden post-detach). One tightening at priests' price suffices; pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective details constrain: stairway "descends while ascending" knots stomach, mirroring vertigo of loss; lantern as micro-setting charges final bird image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (jasmine ropes pull her). Final lanterns evolve causally from grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover shadow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at spire price ("leave part of herself"), foreclosing wholeness with agency in stepping into projection. Cost unmistakable in self-split; one decisive deepening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-luminous torment emerges organically from particulars (dead cranes to glowing ones); final image reweights premise without moral—ache made useful. No tidy resolution, ambiguity in "lightless light" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: light/shadow bias in "brightness refuses to mourn." Rhythmic control modulates (whispers chorus to weeping release). Priests' dialogue sparse, subtextual, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels; metaphors consistent (ink fish, stained dawn) without muddle, taught early. Minor figurative density in high-pressure spire beat ("split into flame and paper") risks overwrite but pays off in closure image—no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadows/dreams/folding transforms loss tropes; risk in lyric fantasy world (detached shadows skitter) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from gem-to-shadow arc; no derivative echoes.</comment>
