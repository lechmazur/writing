<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—skepticism versus courageous kindness—act in scene through agreeing to transcribe despite doubt, earning her final certainty of meaning tied to brother's loss. Jory and Leena apply pressure without stereotypes. Voice distinct; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from solo copying to group transcription, culminating in Charged Poise CR where blank space reconfigures grief as shared silence with cost of mixed aches. Orientation anchored early (tower, whales); no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower's open roofless design and pinned pages constrain choices (expose to wind, become prayer flags); whales' intervals charge final procession image. Sensory details (salt wind, ink scratch) selective via Mara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. shared reflection) signaled early; Leena's arrival deepens pressure under accumulative lens, forcing endurance of entangled aches. Cost legible in "mixing...until you could not tell which ache belonged where."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as unfinished symphony emerges organically; final blank space offers resonant CR reweighting miracles to meaning without moralizing. Subtext in tile's shifts avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with skeptical perceptual bias (dismisses but feels rhythm); rhythmic prose modulates from doubt to bloom. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Jory's confession, Leena's whisper advances stakes).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful figurative build (symphony motif) without muddle in peak (Leena traces). No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to dawn close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Magic square tile's memory-entangling via handwriting synthesizes math, whales, grief freshly; risk of shifting patterns heightens stakes, inevitable at blank center payoff.</comment>
