<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the chest-click after naming Altair, where fear and boldness collide in a micro-choice that earns the idea's release with ongoing cost. Interiority particularized through embodied details like throat-as-gate and ribbon-warmth. Locksmith applies crucible pressure without overshadowing narrator's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of disorientation and revelations builds to Charged Poise RR at "idea burst up... room steadied," with cost in fear's warning. Orientation via deliberate disorientation pays off at spinning stars revealing fear's wrapping. Single scene fits scope; closure cost legible in final climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pool and stars constrain climax (hair floats to Altair reflection; first star unlocks). Sensory hierarchy (cold metal, ink night) reflects urgency; disorienting spatial shifts coherent and purposeful. Micro-setting (ribbon, comma-tool) charges final image without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped idea) signaled early, tightens via star-naming reversal that forecloses fear's gate with chest-latch cost. Agency in confession and stare; pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise. One deepening suffices, charging ending under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fear-as-loving-jailer emerges organically via pool-laughter and warning, reweighting boldness as ordinary in final map/gratitude image. Subtext in ribbon's reprise avoids moralizing; resonance from particulars like Altair-click.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (cosmic hush, sideways direction) biases noticing toward stars/secrets; rhythm modulates from disorientation to steadying voice. Sparse dialogue subtextual (words pretend locks); no head-hopping, elision pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (e.g., ink night to doubled stars), varying rhythm without loops. Minor figurative density in spinning beat serves texture without obscuring click; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith-as-idea-unlocker with star-hint mechanics transforms mystic tropes; disorienting nexus risks bold structure heightening stakes. Irreplaceable particulars like comma-tool and hair-braid charge closure inevitably.</comment>
