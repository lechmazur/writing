<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in Mira's hesitation to repair the eye without license yet persisting via improvisation, earning her final vow with relational cost; children's distinct voices and pressures reveal her through status shifts. Interiority particular via "accidental wisdom" motif tied to micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (carving, flutter, ribbon) builds to Charged Poise closure in final vow and wrist-tying, reconfiguring repair as mutual wisdom with felt cost of unlicensed persistence; orientation anchored by window climb in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard cathedral constrains via rafter boy and altar tree carving that seeds "deciduous vows," charging final image; sensory details (petals on pews, wind sighs) filter through Mira's mender bias, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ribbon retrieval as wisdom bridge) tightens accumulatively when boy demands repair, forcing unlicensed improvisation that forecloses safe withdrawal; girl’s wrist-tying crystallizes generational reconfiguration with opportunity cost to Mira's strictness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of repair/vows emerges via particulars (carved tree, improvised eye, ribbon shift), culminating in non-literal resonant answer—"accidental wisdom warmed the cold nave"—reweighting Mira's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mira's "accidental wisdom" phrasing and grumbles; dialogue goal-driven (boy spits vows break first, girl reconfigures ribbon) with subtext, single POV stable, rhythm modulates from feisty entry to warmed closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bag offered only crumbs, thread, and a cracked lens" advances plot/character); no loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figurative orchard images without muddle in peak repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quartz mender in orchard-cathedral transforms trope of fallen artisan into generational wisdom loop; risk in feisty voice heightens stakes via child's reversal, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
