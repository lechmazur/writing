<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's limitation (foresight/hindsight without present) creates contradictory impulses shown in playful testing of paths and dream reliance, earning transcendence with blood-cost in final terminal act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through dream shards building to CR closure ("I transcend") with legible cost in hatch letting go and path acceptance; orientation anchored early in bunker arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest constrain choices (seal slot, storm deadline) and charge final image of "wind combs the canopy"; sensory details (sweet dusty scent, wet concrete) filter through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (path-choosing worthiness) deepens accumulatively via dreams and terminal, forcing agency in blood print that forecloses isolation with forest "handshake" cost; single tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ash woman's question ("Do you think you choose, or are you chosen?") yields resonant CR answer in final transcendence image, reweighting paths/forest motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice ("joke with a blade hidden in the punchline") biases perception to dreams/paths; stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically under storm pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (vines as "green fingers refusing surrender") propels via varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts dull closure image of "heartbeat lines" map.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of decaying military directive overtaken by sentient forest, with character limitation enabling bold lyric transcendence; risk-taking in dream-mosaic heightens stakes organically.</comment>
