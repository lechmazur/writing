<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (fear heavy feet vs. chasing down scree), and final loose leash hold is earned by prior micro-choices like vigil patience; guides as secondary pressure reveal Mara's flaws without dominance. Embodied emotions peak sharply in "hands shake, but she uses the ticket punch to bite open the twisted knot, star by star."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from chase to vigil to yelp-driven descent; on-page RR closure in freeing dog and loose leash reconfigures options with felt cost of unused courage. Orientation anchored instantly post-leash break; no shards, coherent single window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sensory details (scree slope, bracken thicket, sea humming) constrain choices like indirect routes and descent; recurring lantern/sea charges final dawn seam image. Veiled ridgeway and pier evolve tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover dog/find courage) signaled early, tightens via accumulative vigil-yelp cadence shift narrowing to dark descent; agency in punch-use frees with cost (shaking hands). Pressure coheres under lens, protagonist endurance forecloses panicked chase path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of courage in corners emerges organically from indirect routes and vigil; final punched paper/kept fare offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior leashes without moralizing. Sea lullaby callbacks shift meaning, embracing fear's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (patterns in stars/punch, sea listening); rhythmic diction modulates from chase urgency to vigil poise. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I lost him" stamps fare), advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "star by star, until the wire gives" advances plot/emotion/image); varied rhythm flows read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. Metaphors consistent (leash frayed like seafoam), propel without overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic guides/ticket punch transforms lost-dog trope into courage fable; indirect routes risk bold lyric structure heightening stakes. Irreplaceable punch-use in freeing feels inevitable from fare motif.</comment>
