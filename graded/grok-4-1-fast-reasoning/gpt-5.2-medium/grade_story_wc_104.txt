<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chain as vow consistently roots motivation and constrains choices, like wrapping it around rusted handle; patiently strategic trait shown in decoding and impeding without rush. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: riddle to arrow to keys to vault, then engine growl forces impedance tightening. Closure as Charged Poise lands in "first seeds spill into waiting hands" with chain's trembling cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Carnival micro-setting constrains brilliantly—piano blocks stairs, giant bear hides drums—evolving with action; final riverbed charges resilience image. Sensory hierarchy (grime, tin smell) biases through Mara's goal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure seeds) signaled in motivation line, tightens causally at "first engine growl" forcing agency in false keys and piano jam. Cost visible in "chained wrist trembling yet steady," charging escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Heavy freedom theme emerges organically from chain vow and boy holding it; final "staggering grace becomes a plan" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting liberation's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in ash-quiet movement and chain as "spare finger"; diction modulates with pressure, rhythmic control peaks in escape beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative like "thunder learning its name," rhythm varies for propulsion; minor density of metaphors in action beats (dust curtain, falling ash) without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Carnival vault synthesis fresh, transforms tropes via seed-resilience angle; risk in poetic compression pays off, chain liberator inevitable in hindsight with heavy-freedom calculus.</comment>
