<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in guilt "ingot in my chest" versus skilled gentleness drive micro-choices like "pick the rope apart, strand by strand"; final endurance of flaw via mending earns closure reconfiguration without tidy erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from rope reconfiguration to bronze casting; CR closure lands in "Forgiveness... one carefully illuminated braid at a time" with conceptual cost of precise mending reweighting guilt premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rope and ice constrain gentle choices, e.g., "warmed my gloves over a lamp"; aurora "threads of color ran down the rope to illuminate tiny frost bells" charges climax image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve names signaled early tightens accumulatively via reconfiguration success forcing endurance of haste flaw; cost legible in "pits that cannot be polished away" parallel, though external pressure light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mending parallels from personal chime error to rope yield emergent theme; final "bronze strip... children will dance to names they never knew" reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in caster's "molds, negative spaces that insist on being filled"; rhythmic modulation peaks in "notes fell... snowmelt ardor against my cheeks" under reconfiguration pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "breath sounded like filings in a bell"; varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors avoid muddle in peak rope tuck.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax casting with knotted rope transcription transforms memory trope; risk in auroral harmonics pays off inevitably at bronze closure.</comment>
