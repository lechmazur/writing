<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict peaks concretely when guilt "makes even duty hesitate," driving micro-choices like pausing the pendulum; contradictory impulses act in scene with embodied shame "turning like a key." Final renunciation of imbalance earned via causal chain to widow confrontation. Flawless individual traits shown through actions, no safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: corrosion scratch → rake alignment → lead discovery → removal → ridge recalibration, with on-page RR closure as "small, painful easing" after tide meets notch, cost legible in unrelieved loss of men. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single-shard scope perfect. No unkept setups, persistent constraint of jury chain shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and pendulum bob constrain choices—bob as plumb on ridge charges final image where wave meets notch; sensory hierarchy (heat from cold stone, green corrosion) reflects Mara's priorities. Details evolve causally (tide turning), tactile navigation lived-in. Micro-setting (bob, rake) elevates beyond vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance post-guilt) signaled early, tightens via lead discovery narrowing options to mechanical penance; agency in bob alignment forces trade-off with visible emotional cost ("hot coal from throat"). Causal escalation under lens culminates in charged poise at widow's nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges organically from gear teeth and pendulum arcs, reweighting sabotage premise without statement; final image of "pendulum that must pass through center again and again" offers non-literal answer to balance question. Complexity lingers in partial absolution, no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to mechanical precision ("one tooth of the gear"); rhythm modulates with pressure (short hush sentences at pause). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual at widow scene; diction controlled, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayered (e.g., "guilt makes even duty hesitate" advances character/plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("surf gnawing the ridge"). Propulsion peaks in discovery sequence without overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sabotaged clock via rake inscriptions transforms tide-safety trope into ethical engineering conspiracy; "incremental absolution" fresh synthesis inevitable from particulars. Lyrical risk heightens stakes in ridge vision without gimmickry.</comment>
