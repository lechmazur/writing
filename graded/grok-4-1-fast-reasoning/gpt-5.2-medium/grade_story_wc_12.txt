<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selo's motivation rooted in rhetorical precision compels escalating choices like irony litany; Mara's internal conflict surfaces via chiasmus-triggered memory of brother vs conquest assumption. Final circle renunciation earned by layered causality with embodied shiver cost. Minor slip: brief diagnostic tone in ending lesson slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rhetorical layers densify to pattern break at circle, delivering CR closure where parasite unravels into breeze, reweighting conquest-to-neighbor with rift tremble cost. Orientation anchored early (basalt ring, possession sense). Single scene, one tightening via parasite lunge/irony sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Basalt Anchor constrains to one color/promise, charging palette-to-circle progression and final modest boundary image. Silence as lanterns/micro-setting guides rhetorical pauses, mirroring internal unraveled states. Sensory hierarchy (muffled air, graphite voice) reflects priestly perceptual bias under rift pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt possession) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via swelling fight to irony-forced choice narrowing conquest option. Mara's agency in circle forecloses with on-page shiver/modest cost. Minor abstractness in parasite's "hook" less visceral than tremble/lunge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of illuminating assumptions (unknown as neighbor) emerges via map memory shift, palette circle reweighting premise without statement. Final image/lesson offers non-literal resonance on power/maps. Subtext in ironic litany charges complexity over tidy conquest moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: pauses as lanterns, cloth-over-bell clarity biases toward rhetorical texture. Stable third-limited POV (Selo focalized), rhythmic modulation peaks in low precise voice under stress. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via anaphora/chiasmus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful (lantern pauses, water-salt) taught early, payoff in circle without muddle. Varied rhythm, no loops/scaffold; minor density in opening risks overwrite but integrates. Clean syntax propels to charged pause ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: rhetoric as exorcism at rift Anchor transforms possession trope via metonymy/loop pedal. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; circle anchor reconfigures maps/power organically. Bold non-causal closure heightens stakes via assumption illumination.</comment>
