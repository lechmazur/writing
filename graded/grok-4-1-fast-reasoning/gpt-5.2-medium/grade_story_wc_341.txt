<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, as in dropping the telescope despite the pilot's stare, reveal contradictory calm and explosive resolve rooted in Juno's legacy; earned change in proving her method with visible emotional cost; no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably with density buildup from cloud-naming to haze entry and signal crackle; CR closure in sealing the notebook as "a small memorial that could fly" reconfigures sky-memory premise with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchored instantly, one tightening via telescope drop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Telescope as micro-setting constrains pivotal drop choice and charges final forehead press; sensory details like "frayed end" and "brass glinted far below" filter through Mara's professional bias, evolving causally; no white-room, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival via sky-memory proof signaled early, deepens accumulatively through Remembrance haze forcing channel gamble; agency in unspooling/reeling alters tactics with legible risk cost; pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patterned remembrance emerges organically from cloud categories and air corridors, answered non-literally by notebook's final seal reweighting data over flowers; resonant without moralizing, complexity in sky's "refusal" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cloud-emotion naming and sky-memory metaphors sustains single POV stability; rhythmic modulation peaks in taut line's tremble; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines propels via varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught without muddle, though dense metaphors in drop beat ("catenary that trembled with old vortices") border overwriting; zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation meteorology, emotional clouds, and air-memory hack via dropped telescope feels inevitable; transforms survival trope through specific sky-wholeness premise without hedging.</comment>
