<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Guardian's micro-choices (weaving, mirror adjustment) reveal values under pressure; girl's embodied guilt (lip-biting, blood) earns confession. Internal conflict shown via contradictory calm/action and silence/sob. Minor slip: deeper interior contradiction could sharpen pivotal mirror descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to light lattice, culminating in Charged Poise RR as girl confesses post-revelation, with felt emotional cost in sobs and dock code signal. Orientation anchored early (dock, guardian, girl by para 2). Closure image ("star can fit inside an eye") reconfigures secret-stake with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Canal/dock micro-setting (wet boards, oil/petals) constrains light play and charges final revelation; recurring shutters/mirror as tools guide choices. Sensory hierarchy poetic yet purposeful, mirroring internal states via ripples. Body (wrist touch, descent) tactile and pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant guilt-stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening light patterns narrowing options to confrontation; agency in endurance/renunciation (girl's lowered mirror, confession). Cost legible in bloodied chin and foreclosed silence during fisher's face reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of light-persuaded darkness emerges organically via star/mirror motifs shifting from secret to accountability; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures enriches ambiguity of absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (poetic biases like "ribs were a staircase"); rhythmic modulation heightens tension. Voice texture distinct, compression purposeful in lyric mode, taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but simile density in revelation beat ("lantern... weeds braided") borders muddle without full pattern payoff, dulling peak slightly. No loops; rhythm varies purposefully. Minor scaffold in repetitive "patterns" phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric light-work as empathy tool transforms confession trope; risk in poetic frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via shutter evolution to dock code.</comment>
