<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orren's survivor traits drive embodied conflict, with bone-rhythm memories heating his chest in the pivotal test, earning his purpose realization without epiphany shortcuts. Mara applies immediate pressure via slate notes and fork return. Contradictory loss/purpose impulses act in-scene, culminating in earned closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to staff sync to child flinch, landing CR closure in "empty slot...had its purpose" with conceptual cost of reweighted loss. Orientation anchors early (conservatory, Orren's arrival). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Winterglass panes and iced orchids constrain via silent pulses; benches vibrate heat-maps, charging final "conservatory glow" image. Sensory hierarchy (skin/light over sound) reflects silent-world urgency, filtered through Orren's wave-perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix vibration flaw) signaled early via slate, tightens accumulatively through Orren's fork calibration test—chest warming sharply—narrowing to child steadied with bright vibration. Agency in silent conducting; cost legible in unflinching flinch resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-song emerges via heat blooms and fork-calibrated vibrations, resonating in final image without moralizing—"glass itself remembered how to sing" reweights silence premise obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature: waves/silence bias shapes noticing (rhythm in bones, thermal smears). Rhythmic prose modulates with pressure; gesture "dialogue" carries subtext naturally. No head-hopping, elisions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines like "fear radiate from his crew as warmth" advance character/atmosphere. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors (wave cresting) cohere without muddle in peak child beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh post-noise world synthesizes heat-emotion vibrations with tuning forks into inevitable CR; transforms survivor trope via "empty slot...question, not a loss," risking lyric silence without gimmick.</comment>
