<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's blindness creates character-specific micro-choices like feeling vibrations and aligning prisms, earning the repair's success; courier and Sera apply relational pressure without stereotypes. Internal calm under time stakes embodies contradictory precision amid urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from crate whir to quay release; orientation anchored in depot by para 2. Charged Poise closure in "hummingbird darted into the fog, singing steady now" reconfigures guidance with fog-cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fountain channel and mist constrain repairs, charging final image; sensory details (oil-cedar, light hiss) filtered through Lio's tactile bias. Depot evolves from shop to quay without spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone fix for fog navigation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via repair tests amid anchor horns; agency in Lio's calibration forecloses failure path with ship's risk legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of decoding indirect feedback emerges via chirps/light parallels, resonating in final "treat every chirp as a question the sea is answering" without statement. Particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with Lio's perceptual signature ("light told him angles"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("That is how I oversee"). Rhythm modulates calm intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; dense propulsion in repair ("soldered by sound, counting the brief sizzles"); varied rhythm accelerates to harbor boom without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind artisan's light-water drone fix synthesizes fresh steampunk ingenuity; risk in sensory causality pays off at closure without gimmick.</comment>
