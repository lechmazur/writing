<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to safeguard innovation drives consistent micro-choices like building the puzzle room, with embodied conflict in hovering hands over the seed; final renunciation earned via prior investigation. Minor flaw: reflective summaries slightly abstract internal tension before the confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links from seed receipt to orthogonal probes to trap-room climax; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page when switch vents room and woman leaves with wet eyes, cost legible in foreclosed contract and slowed seedling. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via room-build suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like cloves-rot odor and mud prints filter through Mara's receptive bias, constraining choices (brookside mail check, shed venting); final brook whisper charges closure image. Micro-setting of workbench/herb boxes guides tactics without generic sprawl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect innovation haven vs corporate control) signaled early, tightens causally via seed-as-trap room forcing OrthoGen agent's stance; agency in leading her into puzzle forecloses commercialization with felt cost in wet eyes and reset locks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of puzzles opening minds not markets emerges organically from seed-room transformation and final rule; resonant non-literal close in shared flowering "on my terms" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing (storm-born silence, hush of possibility); single POV stable, voice modulates from investigative flow to charged poise. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in agent's crossed answers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphor density ("storm-born silence" motif risks loop) dulls peak confrontation propulsion; clarity holds at closure image of vented room.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape-room ingenuity against biotech incursion via living puzzle trap; risk in poetic compression pays off, turning seed trope into stewardship test with non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
