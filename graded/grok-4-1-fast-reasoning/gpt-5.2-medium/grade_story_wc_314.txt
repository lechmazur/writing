<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logic vs. sentiment) act simultaneously when hands shake yet bird patterns compel integration; final wholeness earned via prior micro-choices like whispering the ratio. Embodied emotion peaks in "touch of wonder in her chest like a door opening." Flawless under solo POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure where touching metal reconfigures her craft with emotional cost of sentimentality. Orientation anchored early (cloak, valley, crystal). Birds' ratio insight tightens as single meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall hush and orchard relics constrain setup and charge final image under fall; sensory hierarchy (spray bends light, fruit like rain on stone) reflects alchemist's priorities. Micro-setting (cracked basin, hearth) lived-in via tactile arrangement. No white-room; purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize logic/intuition vs. council fear) signaled early, tightens via birds' pattern narrowing ratio options under accumulative lens. Shaking hands embody felt cost; agency in watching/stirring forecloses pure logic path. One deepening sufficient, charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (logic + wonder = wholeness) emerges organically from particulars like dew scattering colors and starlings' shadow blessing; final touch offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "impossible freshness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual signature (alchemical diagrams vs. leaf music); rhythmic modulation peaks in "slow, ancient freshness." No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. Perceptual bias selective (skeptics admit crystal alive).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (read-aloud flows); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite figurative density—waterfall "bent light into slow, ancient freshness" purposeful. Minor overwriting in orchard description integrated via action. Propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: starlings' flight traces alchemical ratio transforms trope organically. Risk in bird-method insight heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from logic-sentiment buildup. No derivatives; bold orchard lab memory.</comment>
