<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied stress like "relays tick like teeth" and contradictory hunt despite timer; final mercy-stance earned by trauma-causal arc without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via perturbation ripples to CR closure ("fed the pool into the guidance net"); cost legible in "door" he can't cross, orientation anchored in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating observatory constrains via freezing valves and thruster perturbations; geode/tool charges calibration and final ring, mirroring "intangibly tangible" without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seize potential pauses) tightens via gradient steering under timer; agency in folding disturbances peaks with net-feed, cost felt in foreclosed "live branch."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy in algorithmic slack emerges via geode/wedding callbacks; final image reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity on control without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual bias ("holding smoke that still weighs your palm") modulates rhythm under stress; stable first-person elides nothing unearned, prose as fractured mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax (e.g., "twelve minutes before... froze"); no loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in "began the hunt in earnest" without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone-trauma physics into perturbation hunt transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in "bleak exhilaration" heightens stakes organically to CR payoff.</comment>
