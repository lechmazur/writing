<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in pursuing hush despite expected disbelief, earned by father's legacy and lattice-enabled choices; final renunciation of spectacle (not touching bodies) shows hierarchy of values with isolation cost. Interiority particular via sound-filtered perception. No therapy-speak; embodied in hovering weightlessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lattice sounds to lantern discovery, culminating in CR via final chapel image reweighting hush's ownership ("hush would belong to them, not me") with conceptual cost of unbelieved truth. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse/prison. One tightening via scuffed door maps father's echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse reef constrains hovering navigation; lattice as micro-setting tool filters sounds, charges closure when whispered into at lens ("lattice warmed... like a coal"). Sensory bias to sound/hush selective via POV urgency. Final pale beam recharges copperlight motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chase hush) signaled early, deepens texturally via lattice hearing/door scuffs to lens shapes; agency in hovering/whispering forecloses spectacle path with felt cost of disbelief in penultimate paragraph. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet truth vs. cried spectacle emerges organically from wolf scratches echoing to bodies' hidden hush; final image non-literally answers via "hush would belong to them," reweighting son's pursuit with ambiguity of personal truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lattice-filtered sounds ("corridors, a labyrinth of footfalls"); rhythmic control modulates from hovering poise to dawn resolution. Stable first-person; no head-hopping, purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayer (e.g., "beam swept only empty sea and the barred windows"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (light "politely ignored" shapes). Propulsion peaks at lens without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-wolf inverted via hush-chase, lattice impossibilities, bodies-in-lens; risk in poetic lattice-hovering pays off at closure image, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
