<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between cultivated distance and lingering connections act vividly in Mara's job routine and peak with her rule-breaking call to Lena; final renunciation of estrangement earns visible relational cost. Interiority particular via glass disc ritual and sister memory anchored to present caller. No diagnostic speak; embodied in tunnel's "breathing."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of wrong-number calls and estrangement motif tightens to Charged Poise closure when Mara dials Lena ("This is a wrong number that has been trying to become right"), reconfiguring wall/bridge belief with felt rejection risk. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. Cost legible in Lena's wary "Hello" and wait.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring glass disc and booth's grated isolation constrain choices (dial-out privilege broken) and charge final image (note marks bridge). Sensory hierarchy: tunnel sweat/rust, train rumbles filter through Mara's perceptual bias toward secrecy. "Walls sweated rust" mirrors internal estrangement without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (estrangement as safe loop vs. bridge) signaled early, accumulates via woman's mirroring call to force stance crystallization in Mara's agency-driven dial-out; cost unmistakable in "loop had tightened" and Lena's non-hangup poise. One deepening sufficient under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Estrangement theme emerges from particulars (wrong-number poems, sister silence) to resonant final image reweighting premise: wall becomes bridge without moral state. Subtext in caller's "wrong number on purpose" echoes Mara's arc organically. No tidy binary; ambiguity lingers in Lena's silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: biased toward "cultivated estrangement" in noticing disc's "thin enough to slip between the rails." Dialogue subtextual (Mara's angled replies pursue connection indirectly); rhythm modulates from neutral to charged in closure line. No head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "sang a melodically haunted chord" advances motif/atmosphere/action). Rhythmic variety; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak (caller's laugh as "door that will not open twice"). Propulsion peaks in terse closure: "Lena did not hang up."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: underground booth operator's wrong-number ritual transforms estrangement trope via glass disc constraint and tunnel isolation, risking bold dial-out payoff. Non-obvious frame (booth as bridge-hub) inevitable in hindsight; no template echoes.</comment>
