<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Haru's studious trait and restrained mourning drive micro-choices like gilded breadcrumbs and final history-writing, earning endurance with solitude's cost legible; contradictory impulses in inventing amid loss act on-page without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via hum-density increase from shop to garden mix, yielding CR closure in "wrote a final history... name their time" with conceptual cost of scored pause; orientation anchored early, one transition legible, pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and scarred oak constrain invented histories via tactile textures (brittle needles, bruised petals), charging final image; sensory details POV-filtered through stationer's prismatic senses, selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture fading textures escalates texturally via garden hum-deepening that refracts richer histories, narrowing to Charged Poise endurance; agency in charting/placing slips forecloses futile silence with felt restraint cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as textured pause emerges organically from hum-refracted inventions, resonating in final "reading one another's faces the way he read humming lines" without moralizing; complexity lingers in reconstruction's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (prisms in minutes, pages in air) modulates rhythmically under pressure; purposeful compression of sensations legible, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and zero loops/artifacts; figurative coherence (refract prisms, scored pause) heightens without muddle, read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stationer charting lamp-hums into bonsai-tested histories transforms post-silence trope; risk-taking in textural accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
