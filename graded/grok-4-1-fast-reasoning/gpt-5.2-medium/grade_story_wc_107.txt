<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contemplative glassblower's contradictory impulses—guilt freezing her chest vs. choosing wonder—act in scene through narrated tasks and panel-building; final renunciation of narration earned by prior causality, with throat-tightening cost visible on remembering faces.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of crafting and reflection builds to Charged Poise closure: bookmark on console and open notebook reconfigure bunker to observatory; cost legible in "steady decision to let warmth circulate where shame had frozen everything."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting's consoles like "ribs around an empty heart" and meltwater "bright threads" constrain choices (salvaged aluminum frames) and charge final image of glass walls reflecting stars; selective sensory hierarchy reflects glassblower's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of thawing abandonment's verdict tightens accumulatively via throat-tightening memory of faces, forcing quiet micro-choice to stop narrating; agency in panel-shaping forecloses fearful obedience path with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of safe inquiry emerges organically from bookmark's question and glass seams; final image of bookmark beside notebook offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (theatrical narration modulating to hush) and rhythmic control; diction reflects glassblower's "thoughtfully spirited" mind under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "corridor tiles sighed with each drip"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, purposeful figuratives like "blue flame rises to do its patient work" enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower crafting inquiry zones in thawing station transforms abandonment trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyric drive heightens stakes via bookmark's evolving seam-signature.</comment>
