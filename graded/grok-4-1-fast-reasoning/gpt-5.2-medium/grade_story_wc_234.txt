<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (gratitude vs. commodification pressure) act in scene, culminating in earned release of suns with relational cost to Academy and friendship recalibrated. Lio's scientifically romantic traits shown through embodied actions like pouring solar dust. Toma applies immediate pressure as crucible, forcing choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of presence builds to CR closure in final image of colored suns "marking the cost of taking light," with conceptual cost to control legible on-page. Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph (Lio at ember nexus with Toma). No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember nexus (fissure breathing red, basalt ribs) constrains choices via heat/flares syncing with release; nautilus shell as micro-setting charges final palette image. Sensory details (light insisting, rocks sighing) filtered through Lio's priorities, evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve presence vs. licensing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Toma's warning to protest release narrowing options. Agency in pouring vial over shell forces trade-off with visible cost (suns "not weaker, but more specific"). Cost unmistakable in constellation protest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of revaluing freedom over commodification emerges organically from light motifs shifting meaning; final "We will be our own measure" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Shell's spiral accumulates as charged reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable Lio POV with distinct perceptual signature (light as insistence, density); dialogue subtextual ("They cannot patent what you give back") advances plot. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure, prose as character in poetic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in lines like "solar dust ran along the spiral grooves, settling into luminous stripes"; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Figurative language purposeful (pattern taught early), clear under read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and resistance via pocket suns sorted by shell into "palette of resolve"; risk-taking in textured world heightens stakes organically. Turn to protest feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
