<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and particular, shown in her "guarded kindness shift[ing] into openness" via map empathy; contradictory impulses act in her refusal to exhibit the vault despite archivist pressure. Final reframing choice earned by prior discoveries with cost of personal openness. No safety-hedging; flaws like shielding superstition drive competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: video shadows → map tear → henge seam → vault box accumulate density to resonant reconfiguration closure where "shadow no longer needed to wander." On-page cost legible in "refus[ing] to treat the vault as an exhibit" and filming ascent. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vault's "rain scoured fresco... pale bones" and henge "seam into the earth" constrain choices, forcing alcove investigation and empathetic sitting on "damp floor." Sensory hierarchy via Lena's map-perceptive bias; details evolve causally (rain "applause"). Micro-setting (framing knife, camera) charges discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empathic interpretation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing to erased lives; agency in video/map tracing forecloses superstitious blankness. Cost unmistakable: "held her breath and listened for... pain," altering tactics to reframe vs. seal. One decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathic archive for erasures emerges organically from map rips, shadows, box; final "FOR THOSE WHO WERE QUIET" reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like parish maps "names crossed out"; invites ambiguity in softened whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: maps as "creases... what every map refused to say." Lyrical rhythm modulates (slow turning shadow) without head-hopping; diction biased to framing empathy. Brief archivist exchanges carry subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines like "dividing known from unknown like a wound" advance image/action/atmosphere; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Rhythmic variety supports propulsion; closure image "rain... soft applause" recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: map-framing decodes haunted chapel as historical erasure, transforming ghost trope via video shadows and parish box. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from "tear... wound" to visible archive.</comment>
