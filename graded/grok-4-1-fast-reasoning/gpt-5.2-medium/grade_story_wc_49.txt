<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marn's whimsical traits shine in inventive micro-choices like fitting vine into twig harp from "fallen twigs and patient breath," aligning actions with motives; secondary keepers apply pressure by their ashamed silence. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal build or communal turn, leaning competent without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as moonlight threads, stories, and songs gather to resonant reconfiguration: trees drop fruit after vine "stitched to close," with cost legible in "tool that was no longer only his." One tightening when "orchard did not answer" solo, deepening to communal breath; pattern taught early, closure charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Verdant arbor's lightning-scarred trunk and dew constrain choices, with vine as micro-setting handled tactilely to draw "damp moonlight"; sensory hush and sap rise evolve causally, mirroring restoration. Final fruit drop charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore rites in alignment) signaled early, tightens texturally when solo harp fails, forcing keeper involvement with agency in "asked for a single honest breath." Cost felt in foreclosed solo path and communal reliance; pressure coheres to sap "applause."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory over machines emerges via failed solo weave to shared songs yielding fruit; final "keep singing softly to anchor the restored rite" reweights premise non-literally. Particulars like golden threads avoid platitudes, inviting ambiguity in ongoing holiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with whimsical perceptual signature ("vine...like a living wire, eager to carry the note") stable in close third; rhythm modulates from hush to shudder without slippage. Sparse dialogue ("single honest breath") goal-driven, natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with read-aloud propulsion, syntax accelerating in crank turns to "sap rose like applause"; high density weaves sensory/action without loops. Figurative density ("spider silk draws mist") voice-motivated, coherent in climax despite prevalence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer spinning stories into orchard rite, transforming tropes via vine harp and communal exhale; bold lyric risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at handover.</comment>
