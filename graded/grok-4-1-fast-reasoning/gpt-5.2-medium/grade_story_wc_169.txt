<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mina's interiority shines in embodied details like "quiet shaking in her ribs," revealing contradictory impulses of logic versus dream; her micro-choices in revising formulas earn the final communal ascent. Flawless arc from solo puzzler to ensemble without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: balloon launches build density toward CR closure in the helix ascent, reweighting solo failure as shared lift with conceptual cost of uncertain salvation. Gauge's "sideways units" pay off early anomaly teaching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto constrains via wet sand proofs and ledge gauge, charging final updraft image; sensory hierarchy (sea's breath narrowing to mirror flashes) mirrors lucid watchfulness perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for hope vs. collapse) tightens via timeline bleed forcing pattern refinements; agency in coded launches forecloses solo path with legible cost in shared risk. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of computable hope emerges organically from balloon patterns and chalk proofs, resonant CR in "hope, like lift, could be computed and shared" reweighting isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with mathematical perceptual signature ("needle swung to a number that matched no unit") modulates rhythm under pressure; stable single POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image-packed lines like "mirrors flashed like calm lightning"; purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle, minor simile density in launches doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math, timelines, and balloons transforms collapse trope into ensemble lift; risk in "sideways units" averaging pays off inevitably at communal canopy.</comment>
