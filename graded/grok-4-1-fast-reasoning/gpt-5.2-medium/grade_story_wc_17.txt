<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when legacy burden settles "on her chest," forcing compassionate choice against public restoration; earned via family voice discoveries with visible cost of misleading report. Interiority concrete and embodied throughout solo exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echo discoveries tightens to chamber reveal, culminating in CR closure—"submitted a map that showed unstable stone"—with legible cost of foreclosed public access and personal burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage constrains entry, frame alignment, and final chord, charging closure image; sensory details (soot air, vine-pushed ceiling) filter through perceptive bias, mirroring internal states without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wall dreams) deepens accumulatively via diaries/negative/voices, forcing agency in report lie; cost unmistakable in "legacy's burden settled on her chest" and drone-hover pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate echo-carrying emerges organically from particulars; final "promised the sleeping corridors they would be heard only when someone was ready" non-literally reweights legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (echoes as "memory"); rhythmic modulation heightens discoveries, e.g., "corridor answered with a clear chord," no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "held the strip to the afternoon glare"); zero loops, varied rhythm propels to closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-climate echoes-as-legacy vents walls dreaming; risky lyric accumulation transforms ruin trope, inevitable in compassionate final promise.</comment>
