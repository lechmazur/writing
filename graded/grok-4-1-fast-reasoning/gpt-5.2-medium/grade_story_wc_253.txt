<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in repeated bouquet touches amid rituals; earned renunciation peaks in field placement with persistent void cost. Orin's ambiguity stains yet enables lightness, revealed via confession without hedging. Final stasis forecloses forced joy path, credible via goat-kick laughter micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: task narrations build density to ritual tightening (milking reversal yields laugh), culminating in CR closure via petals scattering upward—repricing grief's permission with undeniable emotional cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbines constrain throughout (muffled blades to surf, shadows as clock hands pilgrimage), charging closure as petals ride blade wash. Tactile farmhouse/barn/goat integrate via chores, mirroring internal hush remake without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief) signaled early via co-op notice; deepens accumulatively through Orin confession and goat kick, forcing endurance agency in bouquet release—cost legible as void settles sans comfort surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from mandate cruelty contrast to ritual reclamation; final image reweights "lightness was not happiness but permission" as non-literal answer, lingering ambiguity in grief's movement without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature warps turbines from machinery to surf via narration rhythm; sparse dialogue subtextual (Orin's heroic peels as memory curl). Stable first-person distance modulates to charged hush without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (shavings as ribbons, petals bruise); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (stone into snow confession). Peak closure image crisp, read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mandate aftermath with chore-narration ritual transforms grief tropes; moral ambiguity in performer heightens stakes organically, inevitable in petal-turbine repricing without gimmick.</comment>
