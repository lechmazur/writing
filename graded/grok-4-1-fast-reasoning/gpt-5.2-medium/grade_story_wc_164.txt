<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's cheerful gloom embodies contradictory impulses, seen in laugh curdling to dread at the cliff; Mira's shame forces pivotal confession, earning relational change with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via glass-seeds-doorway chain to DC closure ("ridge trail shimmered into being"); orientation anchors in first paragraph; cost legible in Mira's forehead-to-froth vulnerability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Geode facets and foam pool constrain diagnosis and resolution; crater glass as micro-setting charges final curve-filling image; sensory bias (blues like laughter in mourning) filters through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vanishing paths) tightens causally via seeds' inland bend forcing cliff entry; agency in glass-testing Mira forecloses emotional gap with on-page confession cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of emotional routes emerges via severed paths in facets; final foam ribbon and straightened seeds offer resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV-stable poetic diction ("pockets full of salt and patience") biases perception poetically; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Mira's posture reveals search); rhythmic control peaks in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/metaphor without loops; figurative pattern taught early (joy loops, fear jags) propels without muddle; propulsion peaks in "pool sighed, sending a new ribbon."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fantasy synthesis (emotional paths swallowed by geode) transforms memory-loss trope via glass transcription; risk in bird-seed guidance pays off inevitably at shimmering trail.</comment>
