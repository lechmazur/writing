<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in obsession-driven micro-choices like tracing the prism's fracture, revealing contradictory impulses (blessed/cursed sight) that compel alignment; final proof earned via causal buildup with isolation's felt cost. Retrocognition embodies traits without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard discovery to star-tracked corridor, culminating in Charged Poise closure (reply flash matches engineer code) with legible cost in knees shaking from hope; orientation anchored in opening lines, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hush shard as micro-setting constrains choices (tugs hand, steadies flame) and charges final image; pavilion's hum drop/rise mirrors internal hush, sensory details (wind-combed ribs) filter through POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove meaning) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (visions sharpen, stars narrow) driven by agency in nightly alignments; cost unmistakable in caravan's prior doubt reweighted by beacon's wake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (meteor → shard → proof), final image ("accidents are invitations") reconfigures premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity; no moralizing, resonance from irony in caravan vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (time-loosened echoes) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates with intensity, stable first-person focalization; purposeful compression in visions legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("sound folded inward"), no loops; minor figurative density in star paths ("patient geometry") risks slight overwrites but supports textural lens without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocog post-apoc with hush shard/prism rekindling transforms tropes; risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, star paths heighten stakes organically.</comment>
