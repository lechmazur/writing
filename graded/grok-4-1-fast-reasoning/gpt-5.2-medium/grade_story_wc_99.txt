<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via compass's pull on buried memories; contradictory impulses peak in realization "the severance I blamed on him had begun with my own silence," earning pruning choice with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from lace to ship climb; closure as CR in needle settling "down into my chest" reconfigures blame with felt emotional cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "rain pearls" from cedar and "slick stones" constrain path to cove/ship; bonsai pine charges final "sea-glass hue" image, mirroring internal diffusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming apologies) signaled early, textural escalation via pattern-guided climb and compass tug forces pruning agency; cost unmistakable in softened anger foreclosing blame path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remorse as craft emerges via lace/pruning particulars; ending "deepening cerulean" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting father-blame without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (e.g., sky as "cerulean regret") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in ship creak "syllables," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm; purposeful metaphors (mist diffusing shoreline) taught early, minor figurative density in mid-descriptions doesn't touch closure pruning beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lace-encoded instructions, compass pointing inward, bonsai on ghost ship transforms abandonment trope; risk-taking lace-as-map heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
