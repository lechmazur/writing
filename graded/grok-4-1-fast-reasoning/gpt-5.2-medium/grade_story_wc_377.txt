<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation to preserve wonder drives sculpture-building and defiant spin-up against Auditor, with embodied tension in "shoulders tight with muted vigor." Interiority concrete via hearing "dimming of color," micro-choices like adjusting vanes reveal values. Earned endurance honors mute bells with felt cost in seasonal gaps; Auditor applies crucible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tuning to sculpture confrontation to legacy, with RR closure as ledger dissolves and sculpture endures, cost in fragment's melt ("surrendering droplets"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Lysa climbs bluff with fork). Auditor arrival tightens one meaningful deepening without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Iceberg constrains sculpture hub choice and charges final image ("throwing borrowed rainbows from glass alone"). Sensory selective: wind tremors, grit under feet, pale rainbows on clouds. Bluff above clouds pressures isolation, wind drives vanes tactically. Details POV-biased toward harmonics, no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder vs. standardization) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sculpture spin-up forcing Auditor retreat, narrowing options with legible cost ("burned his palms with clean cold"). Agency in Lysa's rotation speed-up interweaves internal/external. One tightening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truthful wonder emerges via harmonics/images, not statement; "symphonies of truth" reweights premise in closure image of spinning wheel post-melt. Subtext in silence-as-rests, crowd's doubt alignment; ambiguity lingers in thinning fragment without tidy moral. Final basin chime offers non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature ("vibration," "color of wonder") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm under pressure (short sentences at Auditor clash). No dialogue; diction purposeful, no filter excess or head-hopping. Patterned elision of words taught early, legible at harmony payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "iceberg fragment flashed, the bells sang" advances action/atmosphere). Rhythm varies read-aloud, metaphors coherent ("truth had a spectrum"). Minor figurative density in opener purposeful/taught; no loops, scaffolds, or closure-touching artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-verbal world with iceberg-powered kinetic bells transforms harmony tropes organically. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes (mute bells as rests charge closure); no derivatives, hindsight-inevitable via spectrum-truth premise.</comment>
