<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via synesthesia (burlap shouts, wet silk whispers) roots motivation in erasure-driven hunger; contradictory impulses—low voice vs. deeper listening—earn vessel endurance at mirror reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fragment density → label → pattern → container discovery tightens to CR closure; mirror image reconfigures namelessness with conceptual cost of held layers, legible in "my face looked like everyone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Towering containers as labyrinth constrain searches and hide folders; tides dictate visits ("low tide... ebb"), charging final image where "water covered my footprints" mirrors endured erasure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of memories vs. erasure) signaled early, escalates via pattern break to container under textural lens; agency in prying/hiding forces endurance with cost in "shape only while I held them."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges via layered fragments, resolved non-literally in "port air thickened with memory" as vessel resonance; ambiguity of claiming names lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("citrus sting," "dry sand") biases noticing; stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically with pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (texture motif) propels without loops; varied syntax/rhythm peaks in closure ("layers inside me held"), read-aloud ear clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, solvent-erasure, story-vessel in port maze; risk of textural drive pays off inevitably at mirror, transforming invisibility trope.</comment>
