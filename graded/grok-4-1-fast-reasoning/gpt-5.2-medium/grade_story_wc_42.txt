<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in father's lesson on constancy, embodied in palm on clock and leaf choice; micro-choices reveal values under quake pressure, earning final endurance of loss. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in trusting old method over digital; change credible with Lio memory as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: quake causes spinning hand, leaf ticks enable restructure, yielding stable tracking and launch. Orientation anchored by ~100 words in observatory service corridor. Closure as Charged Poise in "restructured time itself into something that could let loss escape," with quake/past windows as legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "domes breathed slow vapor" and leaf tick constrain choices, mirroring internal states via Moon "bright as a scar." Micro-setting (leaf cylinder, clock case) charges final image; quake evolves causally, pressuring rails.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture swarm via stable tracking/launch) signaled early, tightens via leaf restructure narrowing options as quake worsens and prior windows lost. Agency in clamping mic and routing loop; cost visible in "ruined two windows" and bone-shaking roar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of constancy harnessing ephemeral emerges organically from leaf ticks vs. quake chaos, father's lesson, Lio image; final "let loss escape" reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance in leaf/image particulars avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (hands know gears like prayers); rhythmic prose modulates from luminous calm to quake ache. No dialogue; diction controlled, bias in noticing vibrations over digital jitter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring tremors (e.g., "skittering around the dial like a trapped comet"); no loops, metaphors coherent/purposeful. Zero artifacts, clean grammar; final line recharges leaf/escape motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of leaf-timer in quake for camera-pod launch transforms tropes; risk in "aspen leaf" method heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Irreplaceable leaf/clock interplay inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
