<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ilian's gently meticulous trait and internal conflict with his sister's loss drive contradictory impulses, shown in precise ledger notes and whispering his own promise to resolve the vow. Final renunciation—sealing the slide yet changed by it—earned with felt personal cost. No stock phrasing; embodied in throat tightening and fingertip listening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fog to full vow via measuring, culminating in Charged Poise CR where Ilian's input reconfigures his stance ("the act of keeping had changed him"). Orientation anchored by para 1; one tightening via personal whisper forecloses oblivion path with legible emotional cost in final vow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frozen Archive constrains slide's heat leak and lens use; cloud seas and auroras mirror internal suspension, charging final window image where Ilian vows amid brightening sea. Sensory hierarchy (quartz hush, lantern blue) POV-specific; no white-room, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vow from decay) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as frequencies reveal gaps needing Ilian's whisper, narrowing options with borrowed personal cost. Agency in measuring and witnessing forces endurance; final image crystallizes stakes with undeniable reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of conjuring meaning from oblivion emerges via vow reconstruction and Ilian's arc, resonant in final image reweighting illusions as "bright intention" without moralizing. Particulars like river stones and sister letter avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in changed ledger-mirror.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in "fingertips of his mind" and harmonic bands; diction/rhythm modulate from meticulous calm to spike's intensity. Minimal courier dialogue natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short spike sentence amid long descriptives), propulsion mirrors scene (suspended ice to brighten). Figuratives coherent (auroras as slow ink), no overwriting in peak reconstruction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirage jars and luminous vows transforms memory-preservation trope; risk in abstract measuring (frequencies to sound/light) heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via Ilian's personal borrow charging close.</comment>
