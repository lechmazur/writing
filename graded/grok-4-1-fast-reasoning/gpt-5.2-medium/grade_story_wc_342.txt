<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face-blind flaw concretely drives coin decryption and realization, with micro-choices like translating indentations via fractals revealing values under memory pressure; earned shift from isolation to pattern-trust charges closure without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of patterns and sensory anchors builds to CR closure in "stepped out under her painted constellations, accepting the limit of time"; cost legible in hammer strike syncing with sealing safe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Heartwood panel and ladders constrain safe access and painting; recurring fractal details from coin to ceiling charge final image of sky-inside-tree.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Demolition clock tightens dominant stake of sky-mirroring and book-save; foreman boot-rhythm hesitation forces micro-endurance, with hammer onset visibly pricing extra time granted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Discovering limits emerges organically via prosopagnosia paralleled in book's patterns and tree's fate; final image reweights premise as "leaving the sky inside the tree" without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV perceptual signature fixates on non-facial cues like "rhythm of his boots," with lyrical rhythm modulating stillness to subtle pressure; stable distance enhances pattern bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("dust settle on her sleeves") without loops or overwriting; varied syntax accelerates toward hammer-cadence closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia fused with fractal sky in guild-oak library transforms trope of doomed archive into inevitable conceptual risk; fresh angle on limits elevates stakes organically.</comment>
