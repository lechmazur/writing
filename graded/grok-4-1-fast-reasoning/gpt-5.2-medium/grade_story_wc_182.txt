<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lysa's arcane skills drive pivotal renegotiations with clerk and curator, earning her change via consistent resourcefulness rooted in listening and syntax; Orren applies secondary pressure without dominating. Minor flaw: Orren's passivity borders stock sidekick, but doesn't touch closure agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as gaps/silences accumulate to RR closure in mountain's chord and straight path out, with legible cost in store's resistance and curator confrontation. Orientation anchored early via arrival and door; no ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via BOTANY planters and fern-match that frees corridor, charging closure image of rearranging passages; sensory details (wet green air, breathing shelves) purposeful and POV-filtered by Lysa's listening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlearned lessons for rescues) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through clerk block, trapped readers, curator demand to Charged Poise in grammar copy and reader freedom; agency in Lysa's choices forecloses failure path with mission-cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of omissions/corrections emerges organically from gaps and renegotiations, resonant CR in symphony resolution reweighting store's hoarding without moralizing; final image answers unlearned lessons via return verbs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Lysa-focused POV with perceptual signature in syntax/grammar/symphony noticing; rhythmic diction modulates from hushed entry to resolving chord, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (shelves breathing, steps alphabets) pattern-taught via symphony/gaps without muddle; minor overwriting in descriptive ascents slightly dulls mid-beat propulsion, but closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic magic, unfinished books as mistake vaults, and mountain-maze transforms tropes organically; risk in accumulative omissions pays off inevitably at curator's thinned cloak and grammar copy.</comment>
