<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lysa's shift from "anxious elation" to "steadier resolve" at the scar-pressing moment earns her change through embodied fear and curiosity, with contradictory impulses (throat-tightening fear vs. purposeful advance) acting simultaneously. Visionary applies pressure consistently as root-bound guide. Minor diagnostic label-speak like "anxious elation" slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream images and scar-links densify to charged closure: Lysa's blood on the seal mends the crack (RR with legible pain cost in "pain flashed like a small private eclipse"), reconfiguring the covenant without contradiction. Single scene anchors who/where/when early; no orientation debt. Persistent clipping constraint shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's blue sheen and metallic leaves constrain the ritual (sentries, visionary's roots) and charge final image as dusk lifts, with sensory hierarchy narrowing to scars warming and sap breaths under pressure. Details filter through Lysa's curiosity without tourist catalog; environment mirrors internal states via glade-sharpening light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mother's dream intersection) signals early and tightens via Accumulative lens: mental maze walk reveals tearing dreams, forcing blood-trade-off that forecloses flight with shared pain cost. Agency in scar-tracing crystallizes stance; one deepening suffices, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of shared wounds restitching time's leaks emerges organically from scar-flare and blood-seal moments, reweighting covenant via non-literal final image of clipping-compass return. Counter-readings (pain's necessity) linger without moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable from dream-leak question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in biased noticing (blue light sharpening like hedge memory); voice modulates rhythmically under stress (short "pain flashed" sentences). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Heed me" pursues warning goal). No head-hopping; diction fits curious focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm (e.g., staccato scar-tracing buildup to "stitched the crack"); metaphors consistent (eclipse/pain, roots/sap) without muddle in peak beats. Minor synonym proximity ("scars" clusters) and dense figuration slightly drag momentum, but no loops obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of early-future rifts, scar-dream networks, and blood-maze ritual feels inevitable, transforming oracle tropes via root-binding and clipping-compass. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; no close echoes, full premise commitment.</comment>
