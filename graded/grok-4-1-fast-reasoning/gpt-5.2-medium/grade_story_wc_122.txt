<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory numbness versus tactile sensing (vibrations in fingertips, ribs) drives micro-choices like reversing the record and scoring it, earning the final lesson with embodied cost. Kerrin applies pressure via confession and drumming, altering their dynamic. Interiority particular to deafness avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density builds to reversal beat ("crank backward"), filament snap as pattern break delivers RR closure with conceptual cost ("play backward... hearts remember forward"). Orientation anchored early (quarry path, schoolteacher). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cavern walls constrain (palm to feel pulse), workbench tools (needle, record) charge choices; body as micro-setting (boots, ribs) mirrors hush. Sensory bias deaf-specific (vibrations thin). Final drum thrum evolves environment causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early, tightens via reversal/scoring under accumulative lens, forcing trade-off (sting escapes hush). Agency in Mara's conduction/scratching; Listener's jerk shows cost legibility. Escalation reweights to snap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (shape silence into feeling) emerges from filament unraveling, reweights via final image ("pocketed... new lesson") without statement. Resonance from deaf perception particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity in Listener's "shuddering sigh" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with deaf perceptual signature (reads "music in faces and floors," feels "heat in ribs"). Rhythmic prose modulates (hush hush to thrum); signing natural, goal-driven. No head-hopping, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punches in climax: "snapped, recoiling"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (cobweb filament pays off). Propulsion peaks at "scored... sting escape," clear causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf teacher unwinds hush parasite via backward phonograph in vibrating cavern transforms tropes organically. Risky reversal mechanic inevitable from prior vibrations; no derivative echoes.</comment>
