<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's fiercely gentle nature drives contradictory impulses, refusing theft of a stranger's destiny while offering her own pain-memory in the bargaining climax, earning the renunciation with visible cost. Interiority embodied in "the place in her chest where laughter should have lived." Vey's pressure as broker sharpens Mira's resolve without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrival → confrontation → knot revelation → new bargain seals Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost (thread "settled into her skin"; card fully burned). Orientation anchored early in orchard details. Single scene tightens to closure without micro turns or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains via roots-as-runes guiding path and light warnings shaping lantern use; charges closure when "skull apples stopped clacking." Sensory hierarchy (damp sweetness, soft clacks) reflects Mira's gentle reading. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend Jory's soul) signaled early, tightens causally at knot discovery forcing trade-off refusal/escalated self-offer. Agency in "placed her fingers on the thread" forecloses theft path with cost. Vey's "cruel option" complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chosen suffering over theft emerges via bargains; final image ("holes... became seams") reweights premise non-literally with cost. Subtext in silences/gestures like Vey's "unsettled" reaction. No moralizing; ambiguity in orchard's quietude lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (inlays meaning in roots/bones). Voice rhythmic, modulates at peak ("dusky resolve"); dialogue subtextual ("No trade is owed, she murmured, only renewed"). No head-hopping; diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "Tree roots snaked between bones, lifting skulls like pale apples" advances setting/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent ("ash falling like dark pollen"). Propulsion peaks cleanly at burning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard and destiny-threads synthesize fresh premise; transforms bartering trope via "fiercely gentle" calculus. Risk in orchard's rule-set (light trammels dead) pays off at closure image. Non-obvious: pain-forgetfulness as lock.</comment>
