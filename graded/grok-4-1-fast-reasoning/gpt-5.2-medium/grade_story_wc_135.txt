<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's reactively visionary trait drives micro-choices like spacing Sorrel's visits and assembling townsfolk despite slammed shutters, earning the closure assembly with relational cost. Internal conflict between swift closure and slow thawing layers realistically. Boy's challenge reveals values hierarchy without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments (valve, notebook, Ilven) densify pattern taught early, culminating in Charged Poise RR via trumpet note reconfiguring silence with conceptual cost of navigated gaps. Orientation anchored in opening line; intervals elide purposefully without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's wet salt, crushed lime, and rain-bright stones constrain Mara's walks and assemblies, filtering through archivist bias toward absences. Recurring sea/gull/ledger elements charge final trumpet image, mirroring internal mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of compiling meaning tightens accumulatively via fragment discoveries narrowing doubt-corridor options. Agency in intervals forces trade-offs (anger cooling), with legible cost in Sorrel's ripped pages and shutter slams charging closure note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of fragments/silences emerges from particulars like valve hiding and notebook gaps, reweighted non-literally by tremulous invitation note without moralizing. Subtext in rumor/fear/scrape of oars lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature attuned to patterns/absences (e.g., "gaps that felt like reefs"). Dialogue subtextual (boy's "why bother"); rhythm modulates from observational to invitational climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action (e.g., "turned the valve in her palm"); varied syntax propels intervals to closure without loops or muddled figures. No artifacts dull trumpet image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" transforms memory/recovery tropes into fresh art form, with valve/Ilven synthesis inevitable via reactive vision; risks abstract conceit successfully for charged poise.</comment>
