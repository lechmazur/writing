<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ilya's glazier-specific rituals (pond ripples, pane repair) embody motivation to illuminate mundane value, with contradictory patience yielding inspector's thaw; internal conflict surfaces in noctilucent reckonings priming subtle persuasion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from dawn walk to pond demo; closure as Charged Poise in inspector's torn notice and ripple interpretation lands with conceptual cost of erased overlaps; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-beaded panes and lily pond ripples constrain choices (light corridor demo, interference pattern) and charge final repaired-pane image; sensory hierarchy (light over sound) reflects Ilya's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atrium's fate) signaled early tightens via pond demo forcing inspector's stance shift; cost legible in "calm bought by removing motion," charging closure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mundane overlaps vs. efficiency emerges organically via ripple arcs and glass prisms; final horizon-steady pane offers resonant, non-literal repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (light traces, ripple geometry); rhythmic prose modulates from mist hush to gull cry, dialogue subtext-driven (checklist stories).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (ripples as lead came) propels without loops; varied syntax breathes with reflective beats, minor figurative density in climax unpenalized by pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ripple interference as persuasion tool transforms preservation trope via glazier logic; fresh synthesis of light/patterns feels inevitable, risking poetic compression that heightens stakes.</comment>
