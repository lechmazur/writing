<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interior conflict—hiding Arin's letter out of fear—builds contradictory impulses shown in embodied hesitation, earning the climax confession with relational cost. Whimsical perception particularizes voice without stock phrasing. Minor label ("inevitably whimsical") slightly generic but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (smells, spirals, ribbons) tightens to Charged Poise closure where hand-holding reconfigures the "thread" with felt vulnerability cost ("I feared it would bind us again"). Orientation anchored early (causeway, pond, post-storm). No lens ambiguity; persistent secret constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pond, causeway, and twig spiral constrain choices (desk setup, carrying letter) and charge final image (ribbon tied through spiral over water). Sensory selection (wet stone/jasmine, squelching shoes) POV-biased and purposeful. Lily pond mirrors reconnection without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding connective thread) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via client letters to Arin confrontation, narrowing to public admission with agency (reading aloud). Cost legible in exposed secret; one tightening sufficient under lens. Minor abstractness in "thread" declaration pre-Arin slightly dilutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection via unnamed secrets emerges organically from letters/installation, resonant in final "thread connecting...us" without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures (Arin's blank spiral) invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (whimsical metaphors like "seam of the world") biases noticing; stable first-person with clean free indirect. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Suri's question advances stakes). Rhythmic control modulates to quiet intensity at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; no loops/artifacts. Figurative density ("gray sky's leftover bruises") patterned but overwrites slightly in client beat, bordering coherence slip without obscuring closure. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghostwriting secrets via public art yields personal reveal, transforming tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; closure hand-hold bold without gimmick.</comment>
