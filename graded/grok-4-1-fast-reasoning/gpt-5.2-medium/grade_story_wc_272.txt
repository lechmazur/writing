<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via embodied doubt ("repainting the same face, hoping repetition would force reality to behave"); contradictory impulses peak in weaving acceptance of fracture over perfection-chasing, earning closure change with felt cost of sister's altered calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from beam-stitching sea to final steadied radiance; on-page Charged Poise closure via portrait's eyes opening ("watery shine") reconfigures fragmentation with conceptual cost of accepted fracture; orientation anchored swiftly in opening image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust "glowed... with a luminescent ache" and closing walls constrain descent choice; damp floor, webbed prisms tactilely shape weaving tactics; recurring beam/threads charge final stitched image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of realigning fragments tightens accumulatively to filament-weaving under wall pressure; agency in untangling forecloses perfection path with on-page cost of changed sister ("carrying a calm that made room for pain").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of art's uncertain stitching emerges via thread/alignment particulars, reweighted in ending query ("who she would paint next"); resonant non-literal answer via fracture acceptance avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature ("portraits no longer held still") biases toward fractured light/images; rhythmic modulation accelerates in descent, sustains lyric texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in "slivers aligned... face settles when you stop chasing perfection"; metaphors cohere (mirror-crack to stitched radiance) without muddle; zero loops, propulsion peaks in weaving beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot-lighthouse Tower, filament-weaving realities transforms artist-trope; risky lyric risk heightens stakes in walls-filaments constraint, inevitable at hindsight closure.</comment>
