<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in erasing mother's voice via hush, earned through vest and whispers; micro-choices like pacing octagon reveal values with closure cost. Interiority embodied in chest-gathered sound and eerie nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drip patterns accumulate then stutter/break to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "exhaled it out as pure blankness" and final silence-as-home/loss. Single scene anchored early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains pacing/alining seams and charges fractured colors thinning to blankness; mist/dewdrops tactilely mirror hush, sensory hierarchy sound/visual bias perfect for saxophonist. Evolves causally with light/drips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to hush prophecy signaled early, escalates via faster dewdrops/stuttering code under Accumulative lens, agency in whispers narrowing to exhale trade-off; cost unmistakable in mother's voice erasure felt at "pure blankness."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of earned silence over volume emerges organically from vested hush vs. prophecy drip-song; final image reconfigures beauty-as-hiding with non-literal nostalgia/loss resonance, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-silence bias ("play the silence around a note"); rhythmic control modulates from whisper breath to fading colors, stable close-third POV fits lyric Accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "whisper slid through negative space" advances plot/prose/voice); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (postcards/perfume), no loops/artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sax hush vs. drip-code prophecy in prism grotto; risk-taking lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes via negative space, feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
