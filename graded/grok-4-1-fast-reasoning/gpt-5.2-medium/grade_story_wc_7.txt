<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's character excels with concrete interiority (tasting "regret and diagrams" from botanist's stew) and micro-choices under pressure (pruning shoots by taste). Contradictory impulses—gentle rebellion vs. planned defiance—act simultaneously in pruning and sharing. Final shaping of the tree earns a meaningful renunciation with felt risk from patrols.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from planting to alignment-sharing closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise in final pruning/garden). One tightening via pruning warnings narrows options. Cost legible in "patrol lights swept the rail yard" against inside transformation; orientation anchored immediately in greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains choices (vines block light, cracked pot, broken glass skylights) and charges final image ("debris into a small, luminous garden"). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (wet soil/iron smell, dew taste). Micro-setting (shears, terracotta) guides pruning; evolves causally with plant growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beautiful ruins vs. Ministry erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via growth/pruning risks to alignment sharing. Protagonist agency in pruning/sharing forecloses overload path with on-page cost (delirium warning, patrol threat). Coherent pressure crystallizes stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion theme emerges organically from pruning/sharing particulars, reweighting Ministry control via synaptic memory recovery. Final image ("beauty was the safest form of defiance") offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity lingers in subtle, non-forced changes; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (flavor-as-memory lens shapes all noticing). Prose texture rhythmic/poetic ("moons lined up like coins on black velvet"), modulates with intensity. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("the fruit would not make them brave by force"); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density/propulsion: every line advances via layered image/action (e.g., "pruned the tree with care, whispering jokes"). Varied rhythm, coherent metaphors; figurative density purposeful in peak (alignment light/fruit swell). Minor elevated diction fits voice; no loops/artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-tasting chef + synaptic fruit transforms dystopian rebellion into food-driven lyricism. Risky celestial/pruning mechanics grow from particulars (Botanist memory). Inevitable hindsight in ruins-to-garden arc; bold voice elevates beyond tropes.</comment>
