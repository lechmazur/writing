<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Amira's gentle persistence and motivation to build community shine through concrete actions like pairing runners with elders and confronting the officer; Sami's shift from sharp questioning to understanding provides a credible secondary arc earned by experience, though internal contradictions are more implied than simultaneously acted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of quiet acts builds to officer confrontation and route adaptation, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing closure in the daylight bell-ringing with visibility cost; orientation anchors early via ridge, port, and sirens; one meaningful tightening via rumor forces tactical shift without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and ridge constrain meetings and visibility risks, charging the final declaration; sensory details like wind, clay smell, and chalk stars filter through Amira's priorities, evolving with night runs to alleys; spatial choreography clear despite shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sustaining the Quiet Fund escalates accumulatively via rumor and officer visit, forcing agency in decoy route that narrows exposure options with felt adaptation cost; satchel's return fuller crystallizes success under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of anonymity as protective chorus emerges organically from donations, letters, and satchel returns, reweighted in final communal declaration without moralizing; intergenerational songs and hidden notes provide resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with Amira's perceptual signature in amplified quiet and bell chimes; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, like Sami's whispered question advancing his arc; rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in chime descriptions and run beats; minor paraphrase loops in fund explanations (e.g., "Quiet Fund" repetitions) slightly dull momentum but avoid closure; no major artifacts or overwriting in peak officer confrontation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions resistance through bell-signaled anonymity and intergenerational runs transforms quiet endurance trope; risk in daylight declaration heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
