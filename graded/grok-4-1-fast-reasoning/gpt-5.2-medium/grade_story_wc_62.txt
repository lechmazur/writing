<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to find collective grief's shape drives micro-choices like gentle ribbon-tying and chisel guidance; interiority concrete in retracing hesitations. Earned change in carving interlocking arcs shows endurance cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as meditative observations and ribbon rituals build density to CR closure in stone at gate ("arcs now a map of shared pauses"); cost legible in spirit's letting go. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via spirit's cemetery-field lesson.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains via vines/swallowed benches enabling echoes/mentorship; dusk sweat, rain drum, orchids charge family dinner. Recurrent butterflies mirror internal shifts, tying to final lift-off image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collective grief shape) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via spirit-guided clusters to family tying; agency in hosting siblings forecloses solitary path. Cost felt in "private mourning into one chord."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from pauses/ribbons/poems into shared arcs; final image reweights individual losses without moralizing. Subtext in butterflies trembling fabric as funeral crowd resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with meditative perceptual signature ("carving air"); rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise in family stanzas. Spirit dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing from Jonas's interior.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "thundering calm" refrain; varied rhythm propels without loops or muddled figures (e.g., "orange wings drifted like embers"). No scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carver's hesitations, poem-ribbons, butterfly weights into grief-map transforms cemetery trope organically. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight at gate stone.</comment>
