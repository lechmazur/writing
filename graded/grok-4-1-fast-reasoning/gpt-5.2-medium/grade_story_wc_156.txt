<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction between methodical certainty and playful curiosity acts simultaneously in the nested awakenings, compelling her to stop mid-stroke and listen; final renunciation of knowing ("I do not know yet") earned by prior micro-choices like tapping the nickel, with visible cost to professional habits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo patterns and nested awakenings build density to CR closure ("the room stayed bright with possibilities"); orientation anchored early (Mara restoring mural in amphitheater garden); cost legible in self-as-layer realization that reconfigures restoration stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden (sine hedges, tuned stones, comma pools) constrains choices like clapping for crack-matched echoes and charges final nickel-tapping image; sensory hierarchy sound-dominant reflects Mara's profession and bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exchange certainty for curiosity via mural) signaled early, escalates texturally through nested awakenings that narrow options to "What if the last layer is you?"; agency in flicking nickel into pool forces deepening with legible cost to self-conception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of certainty vs. curiosity emerges organically from echo-reflections and nested pauses, reweighted in final "I do not know yet" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in singers' mirror-eyes showing infinite smaller awakenings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sound as map, echoes folding into skull); rhythmic syntax modulates with intensity, e.g., short echoes ("three short and one long") under stress; purposeful surreal compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (e.g., "the splash rang like a bell through the water") propels through surreal beats; figurative language purposeful and coherent, sound motifs without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal restoration via sonic nesting and hobo nickel pinhole fit feels inevitable; bold risk in pause-as-rooms structure heightens stakes without obscuring CR closure.</comment>
