<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's luminous regret is embodied in rubbing the river stone, driving her refusal to purge despite steward's suggestion; contradictory impulses peak when she invites the shadow, leading to the earned closure of giving her unshared name.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to footage comparison realization, culminating in CR closure where shadow gains weight via stone, with cost in Mara's personal forfeiture legible in "a name she had saved from the networks."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>River stone as micro-setting constrains Mara's choices and charges final image, set against blooming library's dusk-threshold petals; sensory details like "perfume onto parchment" filter through her dusk-noticing bias without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve hope tightens via footage-deepening that changes knowledge of shadow's origin; agency in conservatory invitation forecloses purge path with visible cost of her unshared self in closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of weighted hope emerges from particulars like shed skins and anchoring rite, resonating in final image of "careful, borrowable light" that reweights dream-sharing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with dusk-biased perceptual signature ("sunlight thinned to amber"); rhythmic prose modulates from observation to charged poise at metamorphosis, voice distinct and pressure-heightened.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm ("smooth as a held breath"); figurative language purposeful in accumulative mode, no loops, though minor metaphor density in stacks scene slightly risks coherence without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams spawning unbound shadows, transformed via anchoring rite; risk-taking poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early stone motif to weighted figure.</comment>
