<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak at the final knot where family vow revelation falters courage yet compels whispering true name, earning closure choice with visible cost of broken lineage. Interiority concrete and embodied (hands shake, vision sharpens amid racing heart). Flawless micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via knot-unraveling density building sound release to slab-opening RR (Charged Poise) with vow-break cost legible in "name braided with released syllables." Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism walls and salt mirrors constrain via "prismatic threads...urging me to finish"; net's wetness and stormlight heart charge final stitching image. Sensory hierarchy (hush dense as wool, syllable like bell underwater) reflects restorer's priorities. No white-room; evolved with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits via freeing ancestor) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through knot-releases gathering spirits and personal revelation narrowing to trade-off choice. Agency in needle-teasing and stitching forecloses fear-bound path; cost unmistakable in ancestor's query and vow confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fear-vows unmaking unrest emerges organically via mask-breath stitching as resonant answer to hush's prison, reweighting "quiet no longer a prison but a choice" without statement. Spirits' mask-switching images layer ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in restorer's idiom (masks as broken mouths confessing, hush weaving grief) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from hushed density to breathing snap. Stable first-person distance; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "slab shuddered, ready to open" advancing multiple layers; varied rhythm passes read-aloud without loops or muddled metaphors (wool hush to breathing snap coherent). Zero scaffold; propulsion mirrors pressure crescendo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask-restorer exhuming ancestor via needle-unraveled net transforms ghost story into vow-unmaking ritual; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via prismatic urging.</comment>
