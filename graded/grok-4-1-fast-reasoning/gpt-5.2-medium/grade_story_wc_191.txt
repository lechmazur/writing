<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ione's wise adventure shines in micro-choices like peeling paint carefully yet trusting lore to descend, earning her renunciation; contradictory caution-hunger acts in scene without therapy-speak. Final throne refusal forecloses personal power with felt communal cost, rooted in lore-keeper traits. No unearned epiphanies; voice particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ruby flake warms → night journey → waterfall parts → murals flare → gate opens → throne interface unlocks with her truthful answer (CR via murals replaying citizens climbing). Orientation anchors Ione/Archive/night by para 1; cost legible in "carried no crown, yet the story... found its heir." Single continuous causal chain fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (ozone/old paper, bioluminescent veins, apple/circuitry air) filters through lore bias; orchard constrains (count trunks, hollow echo). Pavilion paint layers evolve causally, charging murals; final dawn through waterfall recharges hidden setting. Micro-object (flake) as setting tool shapes choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stairway pre-sunrise) signaled early, tightens via causal agency (flake uses narrow options to throne demand); moral calculus at "name your lineage" forces renunciation with conceptual cost (personal vs. communal). One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres causally without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (remembering > ruling) emerges organically from flake/murals/throne refusal; final image ("story... found its heir") non-literally reweights monarchy premise without moralizing. Complexity in Ione's childish hope vs. truth; no tidy binary, lingers via citizens-circle reveal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (analog hiss/click vs. streams, lore-trusting lens); rhythmic diction ("glittered like a fragment of sunrise trapped in mineral code") modulates nostalgic-futuristic without filter excess. No head-hopping; voice texture biases to relics/history. Prose embodies Ione's cautious hunger.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in discovery beats); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figuratives like "kaleidoscopic waterfall" purposeful/consistent. Propulsion weaves action/atmosphere; closure image clean, charged without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: analog lore vs. streamed memories twists unclaimed throne to communal memory; risk in descending "not ascending" pays off conceptually. Transformation test passes—details like cassette hiss/crown log particularize tropes; bold CR elevates familiarity.</comment>
