<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's "diplomatically fierce" trait shines in courtly challenge turning to precise duel pinning Veller's sleeve, earning closure choice with mechanical arm's hiss as embodied cost. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in offering feints as concessions. Final mercy for Veller reveals value hierarchy with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decoding leads to Veller's demand therefore duel, footwork memorizing angles drives to DC closure where sun's shift signals overture. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in pinned sleeve and exposed theft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Half-painted sundial constrains decoding and duel arcs, charging final baton-like sun line. Glass atrium's tiled duel strip and brook murmur integrate tactilely into action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lysander's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect/reveal plan) signaled early tightens via duel agency mirroring angles, narrowing to pin that forecloses Veller's theft. Escalation causal under lens with blade snap as visible price altering outcome. Moral calculus in mercy sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of questions-to-destinations emerges from sundial decoding and duel path, resonant in final image reweighting civic art as evacuation guide without moralizing. Subtext in Veller's polished smile vs. Lysander's fierce diplomacy. Particulars drive complexity over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in angle-noting and anthem sequencing. Dialogue subtextual: courtly negotiation clause invites duel. Rhythmic control modulates from study to clash without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job as in "footwork would memorize the hidden overture as a path." Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (cymbal clash, baton line). Propulsion clear through peak duel without overwriting.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dueling philosopher decoding musical sundial-map via needle card transforms tropes organically. Risky dignified-chaos tone heightens stakes; final sun baton inevitable from particulars.</comment>
