<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in father's legacy intensifies through micro-choices like fingertip-tracing the bench slat, earning the final realization; embodied emotion in "feeling heat through a wall" avoids abstraction. Minor slips in epiphanic phrasing ("sacred thresholds were not places but measures") border unearned but tie to prior causality without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (logbook code to wood plate to doorframe) build density to CR closure: "sacred thresholds exist where needed distance meets chosen risk," with cost in dissolving corridor and open-ended path. Orientation anchored early ("drifting prism terraces above old fairgrounds"); one tightening via wind-aligned corridor suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drifting prisms and pavilion benches constrain the leap and charge final image, with tactile wood grain and "hush fracture like thin ice" filtering through Mira's priorities. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency (wind shoving sound), evolving causally with terrace shudder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover father's path) signaled early tightens accumulatively via code-plate-route alignment, forcing ethical crossing with agency and cost (silent landing as corridor dissolves). Pressure coheres to reweight options without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (wood rings as intervals, leaps as promise-width) to non-literal CR answer: she builds her maze, reweighting "necessary distances" with risk's cost. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "did not know if she would ever find him."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (measuring breaths to wood rings); rhythmic texture modulates intensity, as in "counting breaths... until the terrace shuddered." Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "ran her fingertips... heard a faint click"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("hush fracture like thin ice") coherent but pulls from peak clarity without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-butterfly prisms, maze-distances in woodgrain, and weather-carved messages transforms tropes; risk-taking in accumulative discoveries heightens stakes, inevitable in "built her own maze of doors" hindsight.</comment>
