<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lani's interiority shines in embodied fear via coral rubbing and ink tremors, with contradictory bravery compelling her decryption choice. Final grafting renunciation earned by prior micro-choices under shared anxiety pressure, foreclosing war path with relational cost. Flawless trait consistency and voice specificity elevate to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: note density builds to radio intervention (DC via reinterpretation), reconfiguring ambush fear into mourning with felt cost in quieted voices speaking of sons. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene causality tight, closure image of coral charged with undeniable price of wounds healed slowly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atrium mist and twilight constrain reflective space amid corridor distrust, evolving causally with beads on leaves mirroring ache. Coral fragment as micro-setting charges final image, grafting polyps onto stone; sensory selection (gray coins, slow breathing) POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert war via notes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through map discovery narrowing ambush to meeting. Lani's agency in radio call forces stance crystallization; cost legible in rifles loaded by fear, final endurance foreclosing revenge with sons' weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shared anxieties emerge implicitly from ink swells and false friends, final coral image resonant non-literal answer reweighting fear into graftable healing without moral. Complexity lingers in war's linguistic traps; no tidy binaries, theme from particulars only.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with translator's perceptual signature in linguistic patterns (false friends, dictionary of fears); rhythmic diction modulates from mist prayer to lotus ache. No head-hopping, purposeful compression taught early via coral maze pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy sentences under stress); metaphors cohere via coral/reef labyrinth pattern without muddle. Zero loops, propulsion peaks in "ink swelled where tears had touched it"; opening anchors stakes, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cast as "safe paper" for cross-side signatures transforms ceasefire trope via decryption; coral grafting inflects wounds innovatively. Non-obvious synthesis of linguistics and healing feels inevitable, bold linguistic angle heightens stakes organically.</comment>
