<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solemn archivist's motivation rooted in treating "grief as a datum" intensifies credibly to parley promise of redaction, earning release with embodied cost (shaking, tugged by past). Interiority concrete via "palm rested on the first letter, the air thickened"; no epiphanies unearned. Minor idealization of competence slightly flattens flaws at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cipher comparisons to retrocognitive shards, culminating in Charged Poise closure as "tin box surfaced" reconfigures archive as "doors" with release cost legible in "trapped July released me." Mosaic shards (zeppelin, vision, beach) taught early via "slipped backward into a scene," transitions legible. Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains parley choice and charges final image ("water rose like a hand"); sensory hierarchy (kerosene, crushed sea grass, wet pulse) filters through archivist's evidentiary gaze. Zeppelin stacks and dunes evolve causally, mirroring internal tension without overt symbolism. Recurrent black pool reweights from threat to offering palm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (diary/truth) signaled early tightens via retrocognition and parley reversal, narrowing to renunciation of unredacted names; agency in debris arrangement forecloses path with Lila's fear pressure. Cost unmistakable in "past tugged harder" and release trade-off under Accumulative lens. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth "between law and violence like a rope pulled tight" emerges organically from parley exchange, reweighted in final "hiss of dunes and...thrum" as archives become doors, not graves. Resonance from particulars (shell shards, ripples) avoids moralizing; ambiguity in Lila's remnant lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature in code/marginalia noticing; rhythmic prose ("slow, stitched cloud," "reel caught in a projector") modulates intensity purposefully. No head-hopping; elisions (cipher details) pay off in ripples key. Distinct texture sustains under parley stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "envelope seal had burned my fingers with a scent of salt and smoke" advances sensory/motivation); varied rhythm, no loops. Purposeful metaphors consistent in lyric pattern without muddle, though minor overwriting in vision ("dunes answered with a wet pulse") nicks peak clarity slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil-rights archive with retrocognition/parley via debris cipher transforms tropes organically; risk in zeppelin-mosaic heightens supernatural stakes without gimmick. Ingenuity peaks in ripples as cipher key, inevitable from prior visions.</comment>
