<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's charming rogue traits compel key turns like teaching patterns and rattling the seed during raid, earning narrator's shift from hesitation to hosting; contradictory fear reorganizes into defiance via embodied chaos of wings. Final endurance forecloses isolation with raid cost. Minor telling of retiree/student roles, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from seed to garden chains to raid scatter, tightening to Charged Poise closure where auditors falter amid spiral argument and rooting messages; cost legible in greenhouse storming and scattering. Orientation anchors early in greenhouse/taxable world. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity/moth dust constrains raid choices, fogging lenses and closing throats to enable escape; pinned spiral charges final image as decoy. Sensory hierarchy via entomologist bias (insects as punctuation/archives). World rules consistent, learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defiance spark vs taxation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to raid where coherent pressure forces stance crystallization in scatter/lead auditors; agency in pattern-planting forecloses capture path with felt chaos cost. Minor abstractness in early dream seizure, but raid pivot charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of planted defiance as untaxable weather emerges from pattern events, reweighted in final garden-rooting image without moralizing; subtext in silences/recipes. Protagonist arc inextricable from spark guard. Resonant non-literal answer to ownership trap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-biased noticing (flutter as punctuation, wings reorganizing fear); rhythmic modulation peaks in raid chaos. Sparse dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (spot counts as code). Stable first-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors coherent/pattern-taught (spirals warping), no muddle in peak raid. Minor figurative density in opener risks slight drag, but varies rhythmically. Zero loops; clean syntax variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxable thoughts with insect/garden semiotics transforms surveillance tropes; risk in cryptic patterns heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: rattle unfolds map to raid poise. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
