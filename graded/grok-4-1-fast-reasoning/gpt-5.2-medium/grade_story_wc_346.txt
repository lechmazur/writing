<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deep interiority rooted in puppet's lullaby vow reveals contradictory mercy vs. clock's numbers, embodied in screwdriver nudge; final sacrifice earned by prior causality with heartbeat cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of tick, hush, and tune builds to CR closure; pane clearing to strangers and hush drifting reconfigures end-times with her legible cost in "heartbeat slipped into their cadence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresnel lens room, workbench puppet, basement clock constrain choices (puppet over gears, screwdriver on escapement); final young keeper image charges hush's merciful arcs from lighthouse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to send lullaby via hush tightens through agency in loosening escapement and singing into puppet; cost unmistakable as gears demand "heartbeat slipped" before midnight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Flawed tenderness of puppet threads mercy across eras, reweighting doomsday premise in hush's global settle; final keeper weeping with "bruised awe" resonates without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias to "nested patterns" and hush shimmer; rhythm modulates from sea verdict to charged final image without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figurative pattern (hush swallowing seconds); no loops, though heavy metaphors in peak sing-into beat cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Doomsday adjuster singing via flawed puppet transforms apocalyptic trope through hush pane's merciful ripple; risk of poetic compression heightens stakes to inevitable keeper reprise.</comment>
