<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's balanced curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like comparing the chain link to the probe despite mourning, earning the ascent and curriculum rewrite with embodied grief-wonder cost. Interior contradiction shines in her humble-fierce motive amid city's secrecy. Final renunciation of sonar-only ways feels character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of edge readings builds from classroom demo to probe lattice to star test, culminating in CR closure where rewriting curriculum reconfigures horizons with undeniable conceptual cost ("grief and wonder braided"). Orientation anchored early in Pelagia post-aliens. One decisive deepening in ascent fixes position sans beacon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Benthic city's biolamps and pressure doors constrain choices, mirroring internal states via dim halls vs. bright stars; chain link as micro-setting charges ascent image where its edge aligns sea-sky-stars. Sensory hierarchy (cold air cutting masks) reflects diver priorities. Final descent evolves setting to enable curriculum shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (starlight navigation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via probe decode and council-granted ascent that forecloses sonar reliance with emotional cost in "certainty felt like grief." Protagonist agency in requesting/test forces trade-off. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of edges expanding responsibility emerges organically from chain-probe-stars progression, reweighted in final image of rewritten curriculum without moralizing. Returning lattice/petals motif shifts from alien mystery to human readiness. Subtext in guards' silence charges somber complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (edge-measuring bias) modulates rhythmically; diction like "fold the horizon outward" reflects Mara's cartographic mind under ascent wonder. Minimal dialogue but sparse quotes (e.g., her class explanation) carry subtext. No head-hopping; elision of probe details paid off in test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from "towers grew from basalt" opener to final charged image; metaphors like "broken pearl" cohere without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; read-aloud rhythm breathes with discovery cadence. Minor thick figuration in probe scene pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of edge geometry/unfolded horizons transforms alien contact into tactile navigation risk, inevitable from chain demo to star alignment. Bold benthic-surface contrast heightens stakes without gimmickry. Non-obvious moral calculus (wonder as grief) commits fully.</comment>
