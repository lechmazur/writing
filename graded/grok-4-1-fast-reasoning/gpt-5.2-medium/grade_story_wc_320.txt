<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "find the beginning in every ending" drives micro-choices like placing the fragment downward against manuals; notebook page torn reveals hierarchy of values with cost to records anchoring earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as tuning density yields blueprint signal; RR closure via mast drop ("slid off its brackets like a surrendered spear") with hush fragment ensuring true fall and sore hands as cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suspended towers and gorge constrain climb, tuning, and drop; "moonlight slid along the cables" and ozone-copper air evolve to charge gentler signal image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to salvage pattern tightens via signal deepening to dismantle blueprint under textural lens; agency in winch work forecloses arrogance with physical cost ("sore hands").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Listen-over-command theme emerges via hush-damped signal yielding receive-post blueprint; torn page flutters as non-literal answer reweighting records' trap without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters static as "orbits, eclipses"; rhythmic syntax mirrors tuning cadence, modulating with dawn labor intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("hush pour downward"); coherent metaphors like "sand drinks water" avoid muddle, varied rhythm flows read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hollywood fragment hush transforming spell-tower to listener synthesizes fresh fantasy practicality; mast fall as "surrendered spear" risks bold reconfiguration inevitably.</comment>
