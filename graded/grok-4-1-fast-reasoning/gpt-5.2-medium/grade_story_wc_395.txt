<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via metadata slips noticed "the way other people notice weather," with contradictory impulses in lying to manager yet pursuing truth; mother's reveal earns final renunciation of silence with personal cost, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as recurring numbers accumulate density to Chute revelation (CR closure), reweighting absence as engineered exile; orientation anchors early in archive and cold case, cost legible in final seeded guidance risking exposure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Servers "hum like a choir muffled by dust" constrain searches and charge absence tone; patch threads "like roads" evolve to constrain final choice (stitched to coat), mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover deleted files' fate) signaled early, deepens via numbers-to-Chute under accumulative lens; agency in midnight Chute dive forecloses safe reporting path, with moral cost (mother's disappearance echoed) unmistakable in closing lie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of engineered silence emerges organically from sung messages and Chute as "exile"; final patch-seeding reconfigures premise without moralizing, resonant answer to absence via living voices beyond archive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "brightly attentive" bias toward metadata anomalies; rhythmic compression heightens midnight dive ("thin electrical lullaby"), stable first-person with no leakage, elisions (admin account) paid off in audit trail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images ("veil of corrupted thumbnails"); figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught (songs/echoes), no loops or scaffolds, varied rhythm accelerates to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive as "Chute" exile space transforms cold case trope; numbers-as-breadcrumbs and mother's buoy promise risk bold reconfiguration, inevitable in hindsight without hedging.</comment>
