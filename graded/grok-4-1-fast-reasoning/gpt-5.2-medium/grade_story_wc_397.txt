<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to learn "the sound of approaching endings" compels micro-choices like escorting Signe and probing with bone tip; embodied sensitivity (ribs expand, thoughts slide) shows contradiction without tidy epiphany. Signe's pressure forces earned renunciation. Minor reflection slightly abstracts peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density increase from ice-tapping pattern to storm tightening; CR closure lands in "endings approach like weather: you trawl for signs, then let them pass," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of futile chasing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains trawling, storm action, and pontoon crawling; bone tip as micro-setting enables net-cutting and charges final windborne image. Sensory hierarchy (wind solace, ice resonance) biases toward narrator's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning endings tightens via escort choice amid storm pressure; endurance in rescue and Signe's wisdom forces renunciation, with legible conceptual cost in foreclosed chasing path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of soft-announced endings emerges via ice pops, bone taps, and Signe's "not the bang, it is the breath"; final image non-literally answers central question by reweighting pursuit as weather to let pass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of resonances (ice hollows, harbor settling) sustains biased noticing; Signe's dialogue subtextually advances via "you already know the sound," with rhythmic modulation under storm stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image (bone tip "finds the knot by feel"); purposeful metaphors like "lungs closing like wet paper" avoid muddle in peak storm beat. Varied rhythm propels without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism and ice-probing for endings; Signe's weather metaphor inevitability grows from resonance pattern, with risk-taking lyric closure heightening stakes.</comment>
