<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lio's contradictory tenderness ("gently and with teeth") and backward walking under pressure compel his mentoring despite hating the system; Mara's shift from scoffing thief to "child who wants to come home" earned via embodied shakes and steadying strokes. Final shard choice reveals values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: shadow show → tea geometry → annotations steady → mirror alignment flips balcony, tag falls (DC closure with practice cost legible in "strokes stop shaking"). Single scene anchors orientation early (playground swing by para 1), no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shard-mirrors, teacup, ink constrain choices (align geometry with shadow); dust smell and creaking swing evolve from hush frame to payoff echo, mirroring internal straightening. POV-biased (archivist notices remnants), no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse exile via new angle) signaled early, causal escalation narrows via unsteady-to-steady annotations forcing "unfit" risk; agency in Mara's mirror angle choice forecloses denial path with visible hand-tremor cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from "words spit back," leaf geometry, shadow hinges; final "annotate this day... even when they push" reconfigures city mercy as proof without stating moral, charged by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close Lio POV with perceptual signature (remnants writhe); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("writing will not feed her" tests stake), rhythms distinguish (Mara snarls, Lio snaps). No head-hopping, compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels (tea pour embeds instruction); rhythmic variety matches pressure, but minor paraphrase loop on "walking backwards" (three echoes) slightly dulls a beat without harming closure. No artifacts in peak alignment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh shard-mirror premise transforms exile trope via geometry/annotations; risk in quiet magic realism (shadow doors) heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from archivist tools to tag fall.</comment>
