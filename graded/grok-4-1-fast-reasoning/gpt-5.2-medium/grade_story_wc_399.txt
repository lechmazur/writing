<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Iri's peripheral awareness and honest gaze drive micro-choices like the ritual bargain, revealing contradictory balance of attention/disregard; prophet's finger tremor embodies restraint amid power. Earned shared motive in final tear-weep moment forecloses ownership path with vulnerability cost. Minor label-speak ("truth under his phrasing") slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory anchors via cues like new moon rites tilting present ritual; single scene orients early (dunes, pavilion, Iri). Charged Poise closure in parapet settling and recognition reconfigures borders/clearings with conceptual cost of chosen secrecy legible in final walk image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dunes/ropes/parapet constrain choices (peripheral gaze, heel taps); sensory hierarchy (grinding pulse, layered hums) reflects Iri's priorities, evolves causally (twitches to alignment). Final clearing collapse charges image, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echo/parapet) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via noon twitches and ritual rhythm matching doubts. Agency in heel taps/breath sync forecloses careless command with prophet's tear cost; minor abstractness in "measured kindness" slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-preserving wisdom emerges via clearings/parapet hums, reweighted in final recognition without ownership. Resonant non-literal answer in "honesty had chosen the right kind of secrecy" ties goal-conflict; no moralizing, ambiguity in restraint lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (peripheral, unguarded eye) biases noticing; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("walk the border"). Stable third-limited distance modulates rhythmically; prophetic whisper and Iri's silent gaze distinguish voices idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer sensory/propulsion (e.g., "dunes answered with slow opening"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor overwrite in repeated "whisperfield calm" and stacked metaphors ("ribs under skin") risks coherence in peak ritual without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (prophet, buried wisdom) transformed via kinetic sand/echo hums and peripheral rite; fresh synthesis of silence-discipline and line-walking feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
