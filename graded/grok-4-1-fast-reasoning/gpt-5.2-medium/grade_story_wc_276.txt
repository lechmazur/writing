<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rovan's cool-headedness drives consistent micro-choices like zigzag rhythm-breaking and voicing silence under erupting harmonics, culminating in earned renunciation at spike-drop with internalized cost; minimal overt internal contradiction slightly limits 9+ entry, but traits compel higher-stakes release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from spike-note to pool-tug, pattern-eruption, and quiet-path threading to static figure; CR closure lands cleanly when spike falls into pool, sealing runes with conceptual cost of internalized warning legible in "feral lullaby inside his ribs."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's reeds, ponds, and sand ribbon constrain every tactic—zigzag to evade matching constellations, arbor for brooding melodies—charging final pool image; sensory hierarchy (hummed glass, quivering chords) filters through Rovan's fisher priorities, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to catch Sileth's echo signaled early tightens via pool resonance and harmonic eruption forcing quiet-path choice; protagonist agency in silence-voicing and spike-handling forecloses capture with felt cost of empty hands and internalized lullaby under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-breaking against tyranny emerges organically from constellation stumbles, feral melodies, and echo-as-warning realization; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer in spike-seal and gentler star-drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature biases to sound textures ("reeds howl softer, like wolves trying to remember a lullaby"); rhythmic control modulates from measured calm to dense eruption without head-hopping, stable close-third POV holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid, purposeful images ("air around his tongue turned dense as water") with varied rhythm; minor figurative density in eruption beat risks overwrite (−0.2), but pattern-taught and closure-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fishing, emotion-ink bait, and goddess-echo warning transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in Textural pattern-breaking heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at rune-revelation.</comment>
