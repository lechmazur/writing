<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "I should have thrown it back... yet I am inadvertently stubborn," compelling the endurance to brace the faltering beam with bleeding ears as visible cost, earning the final housed quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from package salt-map to lens threading light, landing Charged Poise closure in "the library grows quiet... housed" with legible cost in suit seams whispering and pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Body as micro-setting constrains via "pressure makes my ears bleed and the suit seams whisper," charging final image of lighter sea; selective senses (plankton glow, kelp curtain) filter through undertaker's drowned-ribs gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively from taps spelling lost graves to braced beam pulling bones to alcoves, agency in stubborn endurance foreclosing quit-option with on-page bleeding cost charging ending poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of archived rest emerges organically via stitching "catalog numbers onto drifting bones," final image reweights premise with housed quietness as non-literal answer to memory's sink-or-save question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in undertaker idiom ("coffins floated loose," "earth on a coffin") sustains rhythmic control under stress, with purposeful compression in squeezed corridors heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "light bursts, not whole but workable, and it threads through the stacks," zero loops, varied rhythm; figurative pattern (ribs, stitching) taught early pays off without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-mausoleum with lens revitalizing dead-signals feels inevitable in hindsight; bold impossible-spaces risk heightens stakes, transforming tropes via lived underwater archive logic.</comment>
