<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation roots deeply in grandmother's practice and small "clues," driving patient micro-choices like pinning buttons that earn the workers' solidarity at climax. Contradictory impulses emerge in quiet inspiration versus resin-wrapped fear, embodied in sorting amid hush. Final collective release forecloses foreman's control with felt relational cost, fully earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: button catalog density builds to scorched-button stutter revealing owner's name, tightening to foreman's seizure and cliff release as Charged Poise RR with workers' rank-closing cost. Orientation anchors early via warehouse hush and Lysa's hourglass ritual. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in "workers closed ranks" moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting—hourglasses, crates, cliff mouth—constrains choices, as jar aligns with canyon only via stairs and Lysa's timing. Sensory hush ("unearthed silence") evolves to "careful breathing," mirroring internal shift and charging final lighter air. Recurring buttons/amber as tools filter through Lysa's "trash as clues" bias, avoiding tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prophecy for workers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via voice invitations building braid, peaking in foreman's jar seizure forcing rank-closing agency. One decisive deepening at scorched button narrows options, with visible cost in fear confrontation. Closure crystallizes plan with undeniable relational price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shared wisdom emerges organically from button "alphabet" and braided echoes, reweighting prophecy from owners' command to workers' plan without statement. Final image—"air felt lighter"—resonates non-literally, tying time/buttons/listening to possibility amid prior resin-fear particulars. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "choices" versus command.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Lysa-specific perceptual signature: "stubborn things workers dropped" as clues, modulating rhythm from hush to charged release. Lyrical diction ("canyon echo humming") taught early, consistent, legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping; compression purposeful, paying off in timed pour-out.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "pinned them to cloth in long rows" advances method/stakes). Varied rhythm breathes with scene, no loops or scaffolds; figurative braid/amber flow coherent, pattern-taught. Minor density in opening metaphors contained, not obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prophecy-unscrambling via buttons/echoes transforms amber warehouse trope into worker-led possibility map. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via grandmother's seamstress method. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity to cliff release.</comment>
