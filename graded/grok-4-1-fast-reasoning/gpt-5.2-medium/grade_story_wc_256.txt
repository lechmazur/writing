<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to discover connection's texture drives micro-choices like questioning Mara and proposing raw archive, earning Mara's shift without tidy epiphany. Mara applies pressure as foil, her confession ("doctored early reports") revealing flaws that complicate ethics. Minor reflection-led summaries slightly abstract internal conflict from embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from lens experiment to redesign to press honesty, with CR closure in "reporters entered the chamber expecting a demo and met their own doubts" reweighting pilgrimage with conceptual cost of raw voices over metrics. Orientation anchors early via lab and post-blackout context. Single tightening via Mara's admission suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lab's "velvet baffles and copper throats" and soot lens constrain choices (mounting, ringing) and charge final chorus image. Sensory hierarchy (sounds as "textured air" with weight/temperature) filters through narrator's sonic bias. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal shifts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (real vs. scripted connection) tightens via redesign inviting replies and decision to play raw archive, forcing trade-off (honesty vs. funding) with agency in "propel the lens toward honesty." Cost legible in officials answering questions aloud. One deepening under textural lens suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of connection's texture emerges from particulars like refracted lullabies and raw chorus, culminating in non-literal resonance: "the city walked the loop for months, learning that connection has texture." Subtext in Mara's loosening posture avoids moralizing; ambiguity in comfort's cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breaks silence into colors," sounds with "weight and temperature") biases noticing toward sonic texture, stable in first-person. Dialogue subtextual ("route mattered... like a pilgrimage?"); natural rhythm distinguishes voices. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in chamber scenes without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "soot-black glass made a small sun in shadow" advances setting/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density ("golden shadows pooled") in reflective beats risks overwrite but pattern-taught and legible. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic lab, prism bells, soot lens refracting lost audio transforms connection tropes into textured pilgrimage. Risky poetic sci-fi commits to premise without retreat; final raw chorus turn inevitable from established questioning. No derivative echoes; voice/setting cohere singularly.</comment>
