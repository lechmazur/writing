<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lan's internal fight and confession reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously at climax, earning his renunciation with visible cost; Sera's motive roots choices consistently. Minor summary of Lan's past visions slightly abstracts embodiment before possession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via crystal chimes and shadows to resonant reconfiguration when force slips out through song, with felt cost in Lan's struggle; single scene oriented early, closure on-page via charged poise in pearl's glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Musical crystals and overlapping shadows constrain choices (Lan warns of seams, force emerges through them) and charge final image of braided shadows and pearl; sensory details (chiming notes, bright darkness) purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (making ordinary magic audible) tightens via possession reversal, narrowing to song endurance; cost legible in Lan's staggered fight and softened force, driven by Sera/Lan agency under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of noticing unseen forces in ordinary emerges from wish, possession, and song without statement; final image of enchanted footsteps offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mystical phrasing ("bright darkness," chiming crystals); stable third-person limited with clean focalization on Sera/Lan interplay; minor proximity to omniscient in Lan's thoughts but serves closure coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety in sensory propulsion; purposeful metaphors (shadows as reeds) integrate without muddle. Minor paraphrase loop in "overlapping shadows" thrice before climax slightly dulls one mid-beat (−0.4 non-closure).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism via cave tuning unseen forces through song transforms tropes; risk in "bright darkness" tone heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
