<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lian's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" drives consistent micro-choices, from coding fortunes to redirecting the light, earning her final uncoded message; embodied tension in prophetic curse shows contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. Mara and courier apply precise pressure, revealing Lian's competence balanced by struggle (wrong hands). Minor reflective backstory anchors present without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of secrets/prophecies building to CR closure: burning fortunes and uncoded message reconfigures her role with conceptual cost of silencing old power ("honest smell of salt"). Orientation anchored early (takeout sweeping); tightening via coded cookies reaching "wrong hands" narrows options purposefully. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in final desk moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse as micro-setting constrains pivotal choices (Fresnel lens shutters direct phantom channel; west cleft hides courier), charging closure image of steady sweep. Sensory hierarchy via Lian's priorities (light bounce, kelp skiff) filters rocky island vividly without catalog. Spatial choreography coherent across storm patrol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control secrets via prophecy/light) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via storm/patrol chasing "lighthouse rhythm"; Lian's agency in lens change and push forecloses paths with visible cost (burned fortunes). One deepening tightens coherent pressure to Charged Poise ending. Moral calculus in "bending" flow vs. stopping it sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically from particulars (soy packets whispers, coded every seventh letter), reweighted in CR: "silence has notes" answers control question without moralizing. Subtext in courier's double-read and Mara's "bending it" lingers ambiguously. Final image resonates prior prophecies non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (light bounces, fortune phrasing as code); diction/rhythm modulate tension (short storm sentences). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (courier's "why it said," Mara's "never stopping the flow"). No head-hopping; elision of names taught as "open secret."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (conveyor tick to beam flashes). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("white tooth," "sesame seed") during setup slightly dulls early momentum but spares closure; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts in peak storm beat. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-spy-lighthouse transforms tropes (prophetic cookies encode microdots; light as secret flow-orchestrator) into inevitable CR. Risky lyric compression heightens enigma without gimmick; no derivative echoes, bold premise commitment.</comment>
