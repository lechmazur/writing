<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's richly perceptive trait and motivation to protect Senn's voice compel the climax song that frees echoes, with embodied emotion in detecting the "thin tremor" and "pain, not pride." Internal conflict surfaces in suspecting the shell's twin nature amid journey revelations. Minor telling of traits slightly dilutes micro-choices before nexus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through shell-guided travel (progressive whispers) leading to nexus confrontation and DC closure: joining shells frees voices with Choir's unraveling cost legible in "web unraveled in frightened glances." Orientation anchors Lira's role by paragraph 2. One tightening at Mael's reveal narrows to counter-song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "luminous thread in the air" and "star-silver rocks" constrain climax choices, as singing makes chamber tremble. Canyon echoes mirror internal states through action. POV-filtered perception sharpens under pressure, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free Senn's echo) tightens causally via shell disclosures and Jaro's shadow-truth, forcing counter-phrase agency with cost in snapping threads and Mael's betrayal. Escalation peaks at nexus with moral calculus between bargain and theft. Minor abstract early stakes refined on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stolen selves emerges organically from echo harvesting reveal and restored shell singing "origins," reweighting premise in CR without moralizing. Final image of kinder canyon returns answers central question resonantly. Subtext in pained echoes avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in echo tremors and melodies; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically under stress, as in climax "low melody that made the chamber tremble." Sparse dialogue natural and subtextual. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "braid a note into stone," varying rhythm accelerates to closure snap. Minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrite but pattern-taught and legible. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-singing world and shell-harvesting intrigue transforms tropes, with risk-taking in luminous threads charging closure. Non-obvious moral calculus on voluntary vs. stolen echoes feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
