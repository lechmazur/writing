<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied perfectly in "peels back the gauze... satisfaction and dread" and deliberate stitch-worsening compel the closure choice with visible physical cost, earning the final legibility of the scar-script.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds (anesthesia→telepathy→ivy memory→tunneling→discovery→return); on-page CR closure reconfigures scar-meaning with legible cost in "wound leaks warmth down her skin like ink," shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tower stairs and cellar crack constrain choices (stitches pull, coffee rings point); recurring saucer charges final pavement-crack image, mirroring scar for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (return miracle to heal scar/neighborhood) signaled early, deepens via plant guilt and deliberate pain-worsening agency; cost unmistakable in leaking wound charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "closure is not a lid but a return" emerges organically from displaced light and scar evolution; final image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature ("chlorophyll syllables," "coffee rings... maps"); rhythmic control heightens pressure, elision taught early and legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors ("grains drift," "dust orbit slowly") propels without loops; minor figurative density in tunneling beat earns no −0.7 as coherent and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants, coffee-ring diagnosis, and foundation miracle transforms tropes; risk-taking in scar-reading quest inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
