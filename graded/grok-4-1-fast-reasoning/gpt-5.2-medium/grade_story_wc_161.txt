<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (suspicion vs. need) act in scene via Oren's chip glance and Merek's confession, earning final trust choice with reinvention cost; interiority particular via dust/beam rituals. Flawless embodiment avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from attic setup to Oren/Merek revelations tightening trust stake; Charged Poise closure lands on-page ("small bloom... attic emptied") with legible cost in risked betrayal path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skylight dust motes constrain bird choice and charge final image, mirroring internal states; tactile attic (foxed paper, beam) guides micro-choices without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant trust stake signaled early, accumulates via meteorite link and confession to dawn sending; agency forecloses suspicion path with felt cost, one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forged trust vs. preservation emerges via meteorite/paper interplay, resonant non-literal answer in final bloom reweighting reinvention without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (dust swirls, withered throat) with rhythmic lyricism; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Oren's "promise"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; purposeful metaphors (bloom/wither) cohere, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust-mote bird selection and meteorite chips synthesize fresh angle on trust/preservation; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
