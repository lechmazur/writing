<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jiro's philosopher traits drive teaching as micro-choices under Ren's pressure, earning Ren's arc from mockery to promise; contradictory impulses act in Ren's confession tying hands to patterns. Final renunciation of loud effort feels earned via net-mending beat. Voice distinct in speech/perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns density tightens from net shadows to cut-reading, landing CR closure in smugglers' catch and tea image with relational cost to Ren's stance. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Parapet seams and moon pools constrain mending/reading choices; fireflies/recurring whisk charge final froth image. Sensory weave (wet stone choir, river currents) mirrors internal shifts via POV filter. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hidden vs. visible effort) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Ren's uselessness confession to pattern-solving; agency in moon-path mending forecloses mockery path with watchfulness cost. Pressure coheres to charged poise in tea ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of honoring unseen emerges from net knots, whisk lattice, river lines without statement; final froth reweights premise non-literally. Complexity in Ren's hypocrisy lingers authentically; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (patterns in stone/shuttle) biases notice consistently; POV stable third-limited, clean shift to Ren. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via Jiro's soft "See." Rhythm modulates pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "fireflies drifted through the new mesh" advances plot/atmosphere/theme); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts. Figurative purpose-taught (moon shreds echo tears), propels to closure unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes net-mending philosophy into guard-smuggler arc organically; whisk-as-baton/net-reading fresh inflection risks poetic voice heightening stakes. No template tropes; hindsight inevitability in pattern reprisals.</comment>
