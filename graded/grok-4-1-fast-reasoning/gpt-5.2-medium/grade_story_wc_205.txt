<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Len's revolutionary past roots motivations in longing and failure, with contradictory impulses (topple vs. reimagine) acting in confessions and joint devising; Yara's grief forces relational crucible; final resolve earned via shard realization, foreclosing factional claims with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: strata build to storm tightening, map revelation as CR reconfigures dispute with conceptual cost of many futures over one; orientation anchored early in Palimpsest/visible time; no shards exceed scope, closure charged in exhibition image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Visible time strata constrain (trip over, pool, project through) and charge final plaza image; baroque details (gilded buttresses, cherubs) filter through poet's bias, evolve with storm; body/attention narrows to mirrors under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (court interpretation) signaled early, deepens via map under textural lens, narrowing to third-act agency; exhibition forecloses faction monopoly with social cost legible in "arguing differently"; persistent mirror constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented honesty emerges via shard/vase (broken ritual), reweighted in poem naming factions as "necessary fragment"; non-literal ending answers reimagine/restore without moralizing, resonant via plaza shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable on Len, perceptual signature in naming shadows/poems; dialogue subtextual (courtesy hiding grief), distinct idioms; rhythmic control modulates from lyric calm to storm hush, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (strata "slide... like slow auroras"); metaphors coherent/patterned (honey, coins, bow on brass); no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies for ear, closure image crisp ("stonework had shifted by a fraction").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time + baroque sci-fi archaeology + ritual breakage transforms tropes; risk in lyric textural drive heightens stakes; exhibition turn inevitable from shard/map particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
