<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sato's interiority shines in concrete contradictions like his "wistful smile that never quite reached his tired eyes" and micro-choices under pressure, such as trading the box for stories instead of coins. Final renunciation (free jar) earned by prior gleaning ethic forecloses isolation with relational cost. Blind spots in village divides drive inevitable outreach that compounds into closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jar-capturing habit to shore experiment, culminating in Charged Poise closure where blended sounds reconfigure generational silence with felt cost ("redemption...settle at last in his chest"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening (box inhales spring) narrows to translator stake. Cost legible in final image of jars as lanterns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "rain warped boards" and "hiss of tide" filter through Sato's poetic bias, constraining choices (jars semicircle on shore feeds box). Loft and dunes evolve from shadowed isolation to lantern-lit belonging, charging final image. Micro-setting (jars) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translator via sweetened sounds) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when box leaks melody, forcing experimental agency that forecloses coin-only path. Cost visible in free jar offer altering tactics to story-gathering. One deepening suffices; pressure coheres to shared music without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-bridge emerges organically from jars translating memories, reweighted in final sharing without moralizing. Widow's confession and youths' questions create irony gaps charging resonance. Closing image answers "sweeten sorrow" non-literally with "lonesome splendor" shared across divides.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic compressions like "penny poems, tiny couplets," stable third-limited POV with rhythmic modulation under ritual stress. Widow's dialogue natural/subtextual ("confessed...swept away"). No head-hopping; elisions (child's absence) pay off in melody's snag.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("At dawn's earliest whistle" bookend cadence taught early); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs. in peak repair beat. Strategic telling compresses backstory; concrete images like "snag on broken teeth" replace generics. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-jars as generational bridges transforms vagrant trope via specific gleaning logic; risk of lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at pier-sharing. No template echoes; bold premise commits without retreat.</comment>
