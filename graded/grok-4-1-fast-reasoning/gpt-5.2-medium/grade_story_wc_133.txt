<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scoff at mysticism but "porosity for disbelief") act in chapel discovery; final brooch exchange earned by shared fatigue, foreclosing solo quest with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via rain-trail pattern density to CR closure; cost legible in "fastened the clouded brooch... clasp bite like a promise" reconfiguring loss into meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal sinkhole and rain trails constrain low-tide walk and charge activation image; painterly sensory filter ("rain trails stitched dark seams") mirrors internal porosity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake deepens from personal brooch quest to shared summoning via Mara pressure, forcing exchange agency; cost unmistakable in brooch forfeiture altering final mental painting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Convergence images reweight water/memory loss into non-literal "convergence of waters and lives"; resonance from silt memories without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature ("sky like a bruise that would not heal") biases to tactile details; sparse dialogue subtext carries awe via "haggard awe" idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("hands shook... salt in my lungs"); no loops, purposeful figures like "exhaled cold air and stink" sharpen convergence without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hydro-cartographer convergence via brooches/rain synthesizes post-war memory-tech organically; risk in silt-compass payoff feels inevitable from rain-trail setup.</comment>
