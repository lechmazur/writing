<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via sister's fire fusing life to "never," with contradictory impulses in bow hand vs. self-exposure; final mosaic features earn change, revealing hierarchy of values without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through flake-scaffold-pullout shards taught early; CR closure in "legal future loosening its grip" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost legible in developed self-plate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap flutters constrain discovery of arrow between gusts, reflecting observant POV; pullout's hidden box and camera charge final image, with sensory hierarchy (hissing tires, creek ice) mirroring urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of amnesty from "never" deepens accumulatively via clue chain to self-exposure; agency in loading plate forecloses old identity with on-page cost in pixelated curve of bow arm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ashes and luminous disbelief recur to reweight loss into mercy without statement; final envelope slide offers non-literal answer to "never," emergent from particulars like wet-plate amnesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "bridge-song" rhythms and pixel metaphors biases noticing consistently; prose syntax modulates with intensity, e.g., "outline stuttered like a bad signal," stable first-person under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in "tiny squares of silvered image winked back" advances image and stakes; varied rhythm, no loops or muddled figures, propels to closure without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pixelated amnesty via wet-plate flake transforms photography trope into fresh refuge; mosaic surrealism risks bold synthesis, inevitable in self-plate payoff heightening stakes.</comment>
