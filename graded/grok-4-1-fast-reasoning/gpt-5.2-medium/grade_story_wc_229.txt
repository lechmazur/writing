<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure shine, like throat clenching on "Jonas, come home," rooting motivation in contradictory tenderness vs. prior heat-stuck words. Final shared tending of beam earns change with relational cost. Voice particular and flawed without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from ritual build to charged poise closure in Jonas's arrival and forehead touch, with felt cost in his shame over foghorn dents. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse post-heat wave. One tightening via scent-perfumed whisper suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse as tunable bell constrains ritual choices in lantern room and railing; jasmine pots and sea slap mirror internal tenderness. Sensory hierarchy biased to narrator's soft thunder. Cobalt tower charges final beam-tending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove whisper's reach tightens texturally through ritual deepening, narrowing loud vs. soft options; agency in beckoning forecloses shouting path. Cost legible in Jonas's eyes filling and shared tremble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of whisper > shout emerges organically from cork's warmth and tower tremor, reweighting premise in final promise image without statement. Subtext in Sello's wince and Jonas's shame adds ambiguity. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (scents as childhood, teeth singing) biases toward tender vibrations; rhythm modulates from shaky hands to steady hum. Stable first-person with purposeful compression; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration; minor figurative density (e.g., "blue bone") purposeful without muddle in peak ritual. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to closure tremble.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse as intent bell transforms foghorn trope via purifying cork and garden scent; risk in magical mechanics heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight from heat-wave opener to dawn promise.</comment>
