<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (reason vs. myth, hate Mara yet tune to her) act in scene via puppet dances and radio listening; final collaboration earned by prior variant allegiance tension. Mara's weary kindness and rewiring reveal distinct voice under pressure. Closure choice forecloses isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fragments/puppets builds to Mara's arrival (inciting) and cloud projection (RR/Charged Poise). Orientation anchored early (Eli's observatory watch). Closure CR via dawn blueprint reconfigures loneliness with legible signal cost; persistent antennas constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storm, cobalt portico, receiver array constrain choices (steal words, frame Mara sanctified, puppet stage on telescope). Sensory hierarchy (ozone, thunder applause) POV-filtered; final light under portico charges closure image, mirroring unification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. new dawn) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via accusation ("stealing my words") to collaborative broadcast narrowing rivalry options. Protagonist agency in unfolding plan; visible cost in separate paths post-unity felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Variant allegiance emerges implicitly from crowd division to shared silhouettes; final blueprint reweights premise of fractured loyalties without moralizing. Shadows/fragments recur to constrain unification, charging ending resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (lightning sketches equations, thunder applause); dialogue subtextual ("stealing my words") advances plot. Rhythmic modulation under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short storm punches amid lyrical builds); no loops/artifacts. Metaphors consistent (tin lantern, blue bruise) propel without muddle, even in peak broadcast beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio fragments, shadow puppets, cloud projections transforms prophet rivalry trope; gritty whimsy (soldering iron chain, grimy rewiring) risks bold premise payoff in unified dawn blueprint.</comment>
