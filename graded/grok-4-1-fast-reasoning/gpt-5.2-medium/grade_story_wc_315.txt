<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in wanting to accuse the imposter but choosing precision for duty; buckle-handling micro-choices reveal values hierarchy with isolation cost. Final endurance of burden earned by prior causality. Internal voice particular, no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: voice pause anomaly leads to buckle check therefore trap revision and ping, culminating in RR/Charged Poise as watcher rehearses alone with echo cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor's thin southern branches constrain trap choice; slick trunk and netting enable capture. Buckle as micro-setting charges detection and final rubbing image. Sensory filter (lanterns, static, oil smell) POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve trust for medicine drop) tightens via agency-driven detection and trap, foreclosing accusation path with isolation cost. Escalation causal: anomaly narrows to public revision. Moral calculus (not punish) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Watcher's burden emerges implicitly from refusal to let clerk fall and final rehearsing image reweighting trust's isolation cost. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like buckle and echo. Thematic question answered non-literally in silence repeating choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-reading (pauses, breaths); rhythmic diction modulates tension, compressing under stress. Voice as character: poetic texture ("black glass," "borrowed gloves") consistent and biased. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short stress sentences, flowing observation). Figuratives purposeful without muddle, propelling to closure image. Final line recharges buckle/echo motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aerial pattern-watcher world with buckle muscle memory transforming tropes; risk in poetic compression heightens isolation stakes. Premise feels inevitable via causal particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
