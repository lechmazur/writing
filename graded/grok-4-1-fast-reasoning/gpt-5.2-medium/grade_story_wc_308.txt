<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Historically reverent trait concretely constrains choices, as in appraising the arrowhead's striations and refusing grief-sounds, earning the final stillness with embodied cost in sifted memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echo density builds via hum thirds, flock syncopation, to CR closure in "sequence of intervals, a map you could sing," with cost of inward path over marching felt in stillness refusal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers constrain climb and amplify hum; wind through sockets and bird-script charge final image, mirroring inward navigation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to navigate sans movement deepens via flock tug and pulse sync, agency in tuning/staying still foreclosing chase-option with cost legible in "refusing to chase any sound that was only grief."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of navigation as resonant relationship emerges organically from arrowhead relic, dust memories, to final "travel the towers of bone in stillness," reweighting history-as-map without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sound-biased perceptual signature (overtones, syncopation) and rhythmic prose modulate with intensity, stable close-POV yielding charged poise at "pulse slid into his humming like a second voice."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (e.g., "humming until his body rang in thirds") with varied rhythm; zero loops or artifacts propel to closure image unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone skimmer resonance in bone-canyon world transforms navigation trope; risk in stillness-pulse premise heightens stakes organically to earned CR.</comment>
