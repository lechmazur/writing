<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses acting in the lists (Boundaries vs. Mercy) and phone call, earning the final spine-found compassion; micro-choices like dialing Tessa reveal values hierarchy. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("principles split," "shedding layers") borders therapy-speak but remains embodied without flattening crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers from con reveal through lists/call to CR in pinning tail tip, reweighting fragile convictions with conceptual cost of public admission. Orientation anchored early (Mara carrying crates to workshop post-con); one tightening via Tessa's confession narrows mercy options without causal break. Cost legible in "hands that no longer trembled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Workshop terrariums/heat lamps/chalkboard constrain reflection and choices (tracing scratches, mist hiss amid lists); chameleon tail charges final image as renewal emblem. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (damp cedar, rust shift) mirrors internal thaw; fog/stars evolve to heighten clarity. No white-room; micro-setting guides agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-respect vs. compassion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via call's deepening (Tessa's panic mirrors Mara's convictions), forcing stance crystallization in report/fund duality. Agency in drafting statement forecloses burn-bridges path; cost visible in public mistake admission charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile convictions emerges organically via mirrored lies (Mara/Tessa), culminating in non-literal CR: tail pinning reweights renewal premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (shed tail as cast-off growth) avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in spine-compassion balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (animal-patterned noticing, mist/star bias); rhythmic modulation peaks in call ("voice cracked by cold"). Dialogue natural/subtextual (confession pursuit, sob response); no head-hopping, diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density/momentum with varied rhythm, but figurative density overwrites peak call beat ("anger thinned, layer by layer"); minor synonym churn in reflection ("fragile convictions"). No loops/scaffold obscure closure; strong verbs propel (dialed, washed, pinned).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wildlife scam via regeneration metaphor transforms betrayal trope organically; tail pinning turn inevitable from early setup. Bold risk in quiet CR over confrontation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
