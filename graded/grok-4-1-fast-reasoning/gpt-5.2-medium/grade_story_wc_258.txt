<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's "steadily curious, not brave" contradiction drives micro-choices like unspooling the tape under pressure; Aurel's shame-confession forces relational shift. Interiority poetic but embodied in sensory ties to grandmother; earned commitment to publish/return shows change with ongoing cost. Minor slip: emotions more lyrical than viscerally contradictory in peak street-measuring beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tape/notebooks to street paths and map as CR closure, reweighting inheritance with conceptual cost of perpetual charting. Orientation anchored early (loft post-crash); two-shard structure (loft-streets-loft) with legible transition. Final map image crystallizes before/after with undeniable vow-price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and loft beams constrain measurements and encode data, charging final map; streets' pawnshops/murals/queues evolve with action. Sensory hierarchy (wet stone, rain stitching dusk) reflects curious POV bias. Micro-setting (tape across floorboards) guides choices; post-crash specificity mirrors internal pattern-hunt without clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map patterns via inheritance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening (notebooks to streets) narrowing to heartbeat map; agency in measuring/going out forecloses profit-chasing path. Cost legible in midnight return and vowed publication/return. Minor: street beat complicates but doesn't fully test personal risk under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconstruction over prophecy emerges organically from tape alignments and path-multiplying, reweighting crash as cultural heartbeat without statement. Final map/inheritance offers non-literal answer to repetition/repair question. Subtext in Aurel's shame and grandmother's note embraces ambiguity; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable with perceptual signature (measuring everything before trust); diction/rhythm modulate from hush to charged poise at end. Dialogue subtextual (Aurel's admissions pursue shame-redemption); no head-hopping, elision taught via patterns. Consistent perceptual bias ties noticing to curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in discoveries, longer in reflections); high density in loft/street beats advances image/pressure. Purposeful metaphors (rain stitching, ink-dark thumb) taught early without muddle. Minor overwrite: figurative density in closing map risks slight propulsion dip but fits accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, tape-measure encoding, and post-crypto cultural heartbeat transforms tropes into inevitable pattern-map. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes via reverse-engineering; no derivative echoes, voice/ premise cohere uniquely. Final reconfiguration feels earned from particulars.</comment>
