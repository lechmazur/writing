<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's internal conflict shines in the bubbled apology and replayed testimony, earning the final renunciation of certainty with embodied cost; Founder's incisively kind telepathy reveals character through sharpening questions without scolding. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously as prior righteous anger clashes with emerging nuance. Final choice to loop the cord and tell the "whole seam" forecloses simplistic truth-telling path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations deepen knowledge density toward CR closure: ampoule's letters reprice the drowning's premise with conceptual cost of partial lies hardening harm. Orientation anchored early in descent to garden. Cord-threading motivates spatial progress without breaks; lens clear at "Tell them the whole seam."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Underwater micro-setting constrains choices via cracks, silt, and dome ribs, charging final cord-loop image where weaknesses become paths. Sensory hierarchy (plankton shimmer, dripping weeds, bubbles) reflects diver urgency. Algae fronds "holding still like curtains" mirrors revelation poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth after partial revelation) signaled early tightens accumulatively through nested revelations, narrowing from certainty to nuanced accuracy with agency in ampoule placement. Cost legible in Founder's loneliness animating the city and protagonist's "righteous anger" harm. Final whisper forces stance crystallization under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of nuance vs. certainty emerges organically via cascading truths, reweighting prior testimony without statement; "Nuance is not mercy... accuracy for the living" offers resonant non-literal answer tying to Founder's half-life cost. Final cord-loop and "whole seam" charges ambiguity without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature biases toward watery intimacy ("calm pressure of deep water," "bubbles stumbling"); telepathic "voice" distinct via images over dialogue. Rhythmic control modulates from descent tension to revelation poise without head-hopping. Compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "salt roses grew from broken mosaics" advances setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds. Figurative density purposeful and consistent (bruised twilight ampoule), no muddle in peak revelations. Minor register elevation fits mythic tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned city tropes via cord-threading architecture and foxglove stasis transforms revelation arc; risk in telepathic Founder's loneliness heightens stakes. "Thread a line through the city" turn inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
