<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to become visible through felt kindness intensifies via embodied sense memory (copper smell as lantern), driving micro-choices like the note in the tin; internal endurance of hiddenness earns final reconfiguration without stepping out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds from blackout sob to tape's warmth releasing memories; Charged Poise closure ("pressed the tape fragment to his own cheek") lands with felt cost of poised invisibility reconfigured as remembrance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vents, pipe chases, and tin constrain Lio's navigation and caching, charging final vent-watched child moment; sensory hierarchy (sapphire hush, burnt dust) mirrors priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of felt visibility deepens when tape links child's fear to Lio's caches, narrowing to endurance with cost in remaining unseen yet blanket-received ("good ghost"); agency in note and observation coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of libraries storing fears/hopes emerges implicitly via tape as emotional spool; final cheek-press offers resonant reweighting of visibility premise without moral, lingering in earned ambiguity of hidden aid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with Lio's sensory-biased perceptual signature ("sense memory was his truest lantern"); rhythmic modulation under pressure (short breaths holding) with purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels ("slid into a pipe chase, guiding himself by a memory of copper smell"); figurative coherence (tape as key/spool) enhances without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl-space sensory world transforms hidden helper trope; tape fragment's ferromagnetic fears ingeniously reweights library as emotional archive, risking bold lyricism that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
