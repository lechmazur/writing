Interiority concrete and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from quartz vibration to bear interaction reweighting silence; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "let the crystal whispering forecourt after rain finish the song for me," with legible cost of honest longing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Quartz forecourt constrains choices (ear pressed, shared listening) and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (petrichor, glacial hush) filtered through scribe's priorities mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bear arrival deepens stake via coherent pressure under accumulative lens, forcing endurance that forecloses evasion; cost unmistakable in shifted tactics (ledger as bandage, then score).</comment>
