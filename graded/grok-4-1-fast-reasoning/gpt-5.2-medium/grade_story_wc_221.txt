<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied temporal stretch ("each breath unspooled behind me"), with contradictory impulses of curse/blessing driving micro-choices like pressing the applique to the pane; final alignment earned via prior sensory calibration. Grandmother's backstory anchors present without dominating. Flawless single-POV execution under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sketches and drifts builds to CR closure where walking north reconfigures blame into exploration, with legible cost in leaving station ("alone and yet connected"). Orientation anchored early ("station hung above the black ocean"). No causality breaks; pattern taught via double sky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Double-sky window and applique constrain choices (lining page, glimpsing overlap) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (ventilation slowing like animals, waves before sound) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (hatch rust) tactile and lived-in. Environment mirrors internal drift masterfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alignment amid stretch/blame) signaled early, deepens via sketch drifts narrowing to true north under accumulative lens; agency in glimpse and hatch-turn forecloses station path with felt isolation cost. One tightening sufficient and potent. Minor abstractness in "turn confusion into exploration" but dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of true direction amid fog emerges from star drifts and applique match, reweighting curse premise without statement; final walk offers resonant non-literal answer to belonging. Particulars (Orion smear, Polaris) build complexity organically. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in stretched senses ("sound arrived with a delayed twin"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, POV stable and biased toward temporal oddities. No dialogue; compression purposeful and legible. Voice as character: fisherman's patient geometry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short breaths amid long unspools), metaphors consistent/coherent ("magnet bends iron filings"); no loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in peak sketch beat. Propulsion peaks at "needle... pointed through the sealed service hatch." Ear-test flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of personal time dilation as blessing/curse with compass geometry and star-drift navigation; risk in sci-fi lyricism heightens stakes (temporal body as instrument). Premise transformed via grandmother's north—no derivative echoes. Inevitable hindsight payoff.</comment>
