<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's diligently curious trait drives micro-choices like murmuring hellos to the light and noting patterns, earning the shift from isolation to companioned discovery. Interiority embodied in "held and cut off," with actions aligning to motivation. No deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; curiosity dominates without strong opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light's quiver links to hopscotch spirals, bird arrow, phrasebook sketch, culminating in Charged Poise closure as ship turns and room glows freely. Orientation anchored early (airship chart room, Lio apprentice). Cost legible in foreclosed "dull drift" via final image of imagined atlas.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hopscotch board and porthole constrain choices, aligning patterns to unmapped glare and charging final glow. Sensory vivid and selective (creaking ribs, trembling sheen, rustling sails). Details POV-biased toward patterns, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart discovery over dull drift) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via light's guidance narrowing to door symbol. Agency in noting/aligning forecloses isolation with felt cost in ship's thump and turn. One deepening suffices; minor abstractness in stakes before pattern convergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sociable language bridging isolation emerges organically from greetings-to-light, patterns as coordinates, ending's resonant atlas image reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in light's "sociable isolation" companionate reply. Complexity lingers in unmapped glare's warnings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: silences as neighbors, patterns in scuffs/starlings. Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity (quivering sheen to flaring symbol). Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("shouting down the speaking tube").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful (luminance "stranded," birds as "dark arrow") without muddle in peak (light slides along lines). Minor density overload in opening atmosphere slows propulsion slightly. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks at engine thump.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of hopscotch spirals, stranded light, starling arrows into discovery chart transforms tropes organically. Fresh angle on mapping as greeting/living radiance. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
