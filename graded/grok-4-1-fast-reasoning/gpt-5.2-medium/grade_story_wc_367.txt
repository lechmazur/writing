<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the prophetic utterance ("Tomorrow the water will rise") birthing crisis from laughter, with micro-choices like redirecting the wick earning the final endurance of routine amid raw throat and cautious promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from routine to prophecy to improvised shadows, landing Charged Poise closure in the mayor's request and rising joy, with cost legible in "throat raw but my routine unbroken."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass wick and emerald shutters constrain choices, charging the final lantern return; sensory details like "wet ink" and "spray" evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens via accidental prophecy forcing light-steering agency, with visible costs (raw throat, cleared streets) reweighting options under accumulative lens; mayor's cautious laugh crystallizes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy-from-mirth emerges organically via newspaper shadows into hope, resonant in final image of steering light "until the coast learned to read hope," reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-as-river metaphors and laughter echoes sustains first-person stability; mayor's dialogue carries subtext naturally, modulating with "cautiously."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors (e.g., "green spear"); no loops or artifacts, with "laughed at a thought" line exemplifying clean propulsion even in reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-print prophetic lighthouse routine transforms tropes via wick-shadow mechanics; risky lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "bleed green light into their fibers."</comment>
