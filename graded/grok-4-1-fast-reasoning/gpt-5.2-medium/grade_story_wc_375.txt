<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in refusing to leave despite broken lock, compelling the improvisation with mother's portrait; final endurance of vocation earned via mnemonic traits and prior duty conflict. Interiority particular through artist lens on jawlines and highlights. No unearned epiphanies; change forecloses escape path with emotional cost of using last canvas.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories, discoveries (lock failure, notebook), and art-making tightens to RR closure in mural waking stage, reweighting calling with laughter's echo. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "softly, to keep the echo from dying again." Continuous scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains choices (lantern light for highlights, cave water/pigments for mural) and charges final image of glowing smile across stone. Sensory details selective via POV (rings with auroral sorrow); spatial choreography clear through tunnel to heart. Micro-setting (quartz dressing room) mirrors internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncork creativity) signaled early, tightens via lock breakage forcing artistic rectification under accumulative lens; agency in wedge/painting forecloses return-home option. Escalation driven by deepening discoveries (notebook reveals vocation), cost in confronting mother's abandonment felt on-page. One decisive narrowing sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of art preserving laughter emerges organically from portrait-to-mural arc and notebook; final image of waking stage reconfigures duty-as-cage premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like indigo aurora wash and mother's smile glow. Counter-reading (vocation's swallow) lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: artist filters world through strokes, highlights, pigments; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in laughter. Stable single-POV third limited, no elision or head-hopping; diction controlled and biased toward visual/mnemonic idiom. Prose texture lyrical yet legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "charcoal smudges her knuckles as she sketches" advances action/character/atmosphere); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (crystals as "frozen music") without muddle in peak mural beat. Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mnemonic artist fixes lock via hidden wedge in painted portrait, evolving to crystal mural unlocking stage—transforms fairground trope into healing vocation. Risky lyric compression heightens ingenuity without gimmickry; inevitable hindsight from mother's numbers/notebook.</comment>
