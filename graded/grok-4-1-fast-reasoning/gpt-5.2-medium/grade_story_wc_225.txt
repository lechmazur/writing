<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exiled chess tutor's interior contradiction—past cruelty vs. necessity—acts in scene via chess-biased readings of tapestry and maze; final renunciation earned by micro-choices like rejecting shortcuts, with cost in mirrored self-confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as decoding accumulates to maze navigation and gate press; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page at "pressed the tapestry to the gate and spoke the word return," reconfiguring time and self with felt cost of no fanfare.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth constrains maze choices and charges final gate image; frozen details like mid-pour ale and pinned snowflakes selectively mirror internal pitiless logic, filtering through Mara's edge-reading bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding to forgive/restart time escalates via hush tightening and memory pressure, narrowing options at junctions; agency in winnowing paths forecloses shortcuts with preserved lives as cost, charging closure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness via chess-like decoding emerges organically from frayed moves and mirrored past; final image of "walking on... forgiven... by the patient game within her chest" resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited with chess-perceptual signature (edges as boards, moves in fibers); rhythmic control heightens pressure in maze beats, brief innkeeper dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "fibers lifted like question marks," but minor figurative density in peak maze beats slightly risks coherence without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms frozen-time trope via chess-tapestry decoding and platinum maze mirroring past war logic; fresh synthesis of exile's skill forgiving self feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightening stakes.</comment>
