<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—bargaining innocence against justice—act in the reflective block and compel her enlightening Jonah with visible cost in planned confession; Jonah's embodied fear and steady hands show change. Interiority concrete via scars, soot-black hands, singed marbles. Final micro-choice of handing box earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflection and dialogue reweights guilt into shared grammar, closing with Charged Poise as Jonah carries box like lantern. Orientation anchored early (ridge path, moonlit). Cost legible in "cost her the right to sleep" and foreclosed innocence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge, pines' hush, glazed fractures constrain placement of box and pace reflection; recurring stars charge final shift. Sensory hierarchy via firefighter lens (burn scars, ash stand). Flat stone enables pivotal staging without spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (enlighten Jonah via bargain revelation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through Eli story to confession plan, narrowing Jonah's fear-options with agency in admission and promise. Moral calculus (Eli's lost responsibility vs saved breath) charges peak. Cost unmistakable in Mara's sleep loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fractured courage ("held together") emerges from box/marbles shifting to "guilt could become a warning," resonant non-literal answer in lantern image reweighting pain-as-care. Subtext in silence after "weak," earned via particulars. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person perceptual signature (celestial vastness vs personal cracks) biases noticing; dialogue subtextual ("crack means... weak") pursues goals. Rhythmic control modulates from climbing propulsion to reflective cadence. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: "crown of fire around his family cabin" integrates sensory propulsion; varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with reflection. Zero loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (rivers in fractures). Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: porcelain box transforms guilt-trope via singed marbles/child's note, firefighter scars literal/metaphoric. Risk in heavy reflection pays off in lantern closure. Non-obvious angle on innocence bargain.</comment>
