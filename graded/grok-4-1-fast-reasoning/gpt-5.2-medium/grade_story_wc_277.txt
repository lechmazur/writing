<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste's inherited caution creates contradictory impulses—expose fraud vs. intervene quietly—earning the bargain choice with visible cost of forgoing spectacle, embodied in her father's nib; Sato's guilt mirrors without stereotyping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from Lyle's tremor to plate overlaps and darkroom dust forces confession then airtight bargain as Resonant Reconfiguration; cost legible in nib scratching logbook, lens holds Causal throughout shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echoing domes and fresh dust on plates constrain discovery and charge closure applause; sensory selectivity (red lamps, cocoa mug) filters through Celeste's observant bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover truth tightens via proof overlaps narrowing expose-or-save options; agency in dawn confrontation forecloses scandal path with observatory's felt survival cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orbits of regret emerge organically from particulars—smear as lie, colleague's death—to resonant non-literal close where echoes applaud reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in celestial diction and rhythmic modulation; sparse dialogue carries subtext (Sato's memorized jokes) and advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but celestial metaphors verge dense in mid-beats without full sparsity; no loops, clean syntax supports propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Proof-by-contradiction bargain transforms fraud exposé via astronomy synthesis, risking quiet intervention over pulp serial payoff; inevitable in hindsight from nib promise.</comment>
