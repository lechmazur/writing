<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied motivation in hunger for trees' witness, shown through micro-choices like sweeping dream flakes and setting sextant; final reset of labyrinth earns change from maintainer to reconfigurer with felt personal cost. Contradictory duty vs. private hunger acts in scene without alternation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens (Hybrid) holds: density builds from pin drop to sapling revelation to roof epiphany; CR closure in "reset the remaining stones into a smaller labyrinth that led outward" reconfigures with cost ("subtracting a fraction from my own chest"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via hidden route suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stormlit tower, sapling in drain, wind-bent pines constrain choices (labyrinth blocks trees, moonlight enables sextant); sensory selection sharpens via POV (seawater-wet leaves mirror absorbed grief). Final parapet image charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness trees vs. quantify sorrow) signaled early, tightens via pin/sapling to agency-driven deconstruction narrowing options; cost legible in personal sorrow tick and silent reset under lens. Minor abstractness in initial stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of quantified vs. witnessed grief emerges organically from particulars (dream envelopes, tree rings holding sky); final "mundane miracle" image resonantly reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of heard grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature ("arithmetic of sadness," "trees keep the sky in their rings"); rhythmic diction modulates from calm rounds to stormlit intensity, prose as character in poetic-grounded texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., short ticks amid longer revelations), no loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere (moonlight "stitched itself smooth"); propulsion peaks in deconstruction beat without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of municipal grief-maze, self-healing sextant, tree-witnessing transforms tropes; risk in surreal rules (quantified sorrow, dream-mapping) heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR closure.</comment>
