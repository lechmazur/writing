<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's scheming pacifism drives contradictory impulses—redirecting conflict via box—culminating in empty hands convincing Mara; her tapped beat and dropped knife earn change with bodily cost. Interiority concrete via cellular borrowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silent clicks builds to pin's reappearance and remembered melody, reconfiguring resentment as relief with felt cost in knife drop and leadership shift. Single scene coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary constrains via ear pressure and bone-only clicks, charging final glass-to-stone shift as bodily relief; selective sensory filter (no echoes, tapped hands) mirrors cellular release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release resentment vs. Mara's knife-hold—tightens accumulatively in panic shift; Lio's fingertip push and mouthed argument force Mara's tapping/renunciation, cost legible in slipped knife.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bodily forgiveness before mental resistance emerges via half-melody rewriting cells; final complete pin and blood-memory image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Lio-limited POV with perceptual signature (pressure as secrets, skin-pushed memory); rhythmic prose modulates silence to sway, eliding sound purposefully for bodily focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (cylinder turns clicking softly bones register); varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor metaphor density in opener tugs slightly from peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shifting city, cellular songs, reappearing pin transforms pacifism/redirection trope; risk in silent climax heightens stakes via body-rule inevitability.</comment>
