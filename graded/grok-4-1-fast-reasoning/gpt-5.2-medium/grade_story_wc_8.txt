<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—comfort in the noble lie versus throat-tightening anger—act simultaneously in her rational bargaining, earning Hadrin's admission and her final promise. Hadrin's practiced sigh to self-judgment under the hawk's stare reveals flaws complicating choices. Voices distinct in dialogue idiom; micro-choices like taking the satchel gently foreclose paths with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oriented early via Mara's walk to ivy-overgrown station post-rose petal drop. Causal linkages in dialogue (lock question → reading → parallels → counter → bargain) narrow options to Charged Poise closure. Hadrin's relic-hold to satchel handover reconfigures stakes with felt self-confrontation cost in final image; lens (Hybrid Causal/Situational) holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ivy hides meetings, constraining secretive choice; rosebush anchors time and charges bare final image with seasonal silence motif. Weeds through tiles and lamp under ticket window integrate tactilely via Mara's goal-directed path. Sensory narrowing under dialogue pressure reflects historian's priorities; no white-room, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture truth via letter) signaled early, tightens via Mara's parallels drawing dock strikes to riots, forcing Hadrin's counter and admission. Agency in her questions and exhibit bargain forecloses noble-lie path with relational cost. Escalation under Situational lens crystallizes stances; visible prices (Hadrin's edits addiction) alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges via coerced truce parallels and Hadrin's "one small edit" confession, reweighted in annotated publication promise. Final bare rosebush and wind-threading ivy offer non-literal answer to truth-rescue question, charging closure without moralizing. Subtext in silences and hawk-stare irony lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Mara with perceptual signature (historical marginal notes bias). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven: Mara's rational questions persuade, Hadrin's sighs evade then yield. Rhythmic control modulates—lyric openings breathe into terse bargain; no head-hopping, diction POV-apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: "weeds rose through the tiles like slow smoke" does triple atmospheric/atmospheric/pressure duty. Varied syntax/paragraphs propel from entry to satchel-take; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm heightens peak (hawk judging stewardship); closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rosebush-petal signal to bare-stalk reprise transforms truce-lie trope into fresh civic-narrative bargain. Quiet confrontation in disused station risks bold emotional calculus without gimmick; hindsight inevitability from Mara's parallels to Hadrin's hawk-stare yield.</comment>
