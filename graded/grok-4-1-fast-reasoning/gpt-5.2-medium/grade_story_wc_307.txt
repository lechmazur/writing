<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Doctor's motivation to teach before linguistic loss drives poignant endurance with visible cost in vanishing; narrator's arc shows embodied receptivity ("tongue taste of pennies") under pressure, though internal contradictions act more through observation than simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ripple patterns building to grotto revelation; on-page Conceptual Repricing lands in final understanding of inheritance with doctor's felt cost ("losing another layer of language"), anchors clear by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto constrains choices by shifting "thoughts like filings" and charges closure image via quivering sand/empty ledge; selective sensory details (humming air, penny taste) evolve causally with trance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mastering "vanishing to appear" deepens via trance/ripple prediction, forcing narrator's attention shift; doctor's revelation tightens pressure under Accumulative lens, cost legible in inherited burden charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of attention as disappearance emerges organically from ripple geometry and grotto reversal, reweighting premise in final "carrying the truth" without moralizing; subtext in withheld truths enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature ("sycamore hush deepened") biases toward patterns/silence; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Do not ask what I found"), rhythm modulates with trance intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("ripples widened, noticing thickened segments"); varied syntax/rhythm flows read-aloud, metaphors consistent (pond writing/erasing) without muddle in peak trance beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backwards aging via magnetic attention-shift transforms trope organically; ripple-grotto progression feels inevitable, risk in lyric compression heightens meditative stakes.</comment>
