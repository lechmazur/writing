<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's sensibly eccentric traits drive concrete actions like psychometry readings and jar offerings, revealing internal conflict between certainty and doubt. Motivation intensifies through visions, earning her final renunciation of the compass. Minor deduction for occasional abstract epiphanies like "hinged awakenings" lacking embodied contradiction in peak cave moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from town hush to cavern revelation, with psychometry visions tightening knowledge toward CR closure. Orientation anchors early (Mara post-factory, north cliffs). Cost legible in "some directions exist only while you doubt," reconfiguring premise with conceptual price of accepted uncertainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon and petrichor constrain choices (wading, jarring scents) and charge final image (pouring offering). Sensory hierarchy (scents, resonant hush) filters through Mara's collector bias. Limestone "breathes cool air like a submerged mouth" mirrors internal awakening without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find where explanations fail) signaled early, escalates via visions narrowing to lagoon truth under Accumulative lens. Agency in delving and renunciation forecloses certainty path with felt cost (abandoning compass). One deepening suffices; minor abstractness in warnings slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hinged awakenings emerges organically from compass psychometry and factory origin reveal, reweighting explanation vs. lived experience. Final image (pouring petrichor, open hinges) offers non-literal CR answer with lingering ambiguity. No moralizing; complexity in doubt's cost avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (scent hierarchies, resonant sounds). Poetic diction modulates rhythmically under cave stress, e.g., "boots scrape calcite, each step answering itself." No head-hopping; purposeful compression in visions pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with motif rhythm (hinge clicks); sentence variety breathes with scene. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "sky rinsed clean" and "air itself insists on reverence" slightly dulls peak cavern density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Petrichor collector and psychometry synthesize fresh quest into factory's hushed origin, transforming exploration trope via conceptual hinge. Risky lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes; irreplaceable compass reprise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
