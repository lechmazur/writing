<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's micro-choices like naming braids "sender, recipient, and witness" reveal character-particular interiority under pressure; earned change to "steadier purpose" forecloses passive archiving with cost. Minor slip: no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal unweaving beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as seal triggers rope twitch, unweaving yields gap-archive, merging forms sentences with CR closure; legible cost in revealed treaty harm reconfigures university history on-page. Single scene anchors orientation by para 2; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clock tower gears and rope constrain unweaving choice in tight space, charging final door-fade; sensory draft of "oil and rain" mirrors merging. Micro-setting (rope/seal) evolves causally, POV-filtered through archivist patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merge absence into clarity) signaled early tightens via rebraiding success revealing treaty, forcing stance shift to public restitution; agency in threading seal forecloses forgetting with felt anger/cost. Accumulative deepening reweights stake without reversal excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Absence-as-story emerges organically from gap-archive and faceless diplomat; final deliberate filing under "river and scholarship" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (ink/fiber as "one alphabet"); rhythmic diction modulates from methodical naming to hushed pendulum, heightening pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in merging beat ("wax softening into fiber, fiber darkening into script") propels with varied rhythm; minor scaffold in repeated "warmly methodical" phrasing (−0.2), but no loops touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival magic realism via "fables of absence" and rope-rebraiding transforms tropes; risk in paradox door pays off in conscience-repair CR, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
