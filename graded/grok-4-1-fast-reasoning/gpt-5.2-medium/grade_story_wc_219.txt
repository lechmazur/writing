<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's luminous skeptic trait drives concrete micro-choices like unfiltered listening and self-testing dyes, earning the theft via embodied conflict (lab glow aids readability but risks exposure). Contradictory impulses—council duty vs. chemical pursuit—act simultaneously, culminating in shard-cutting with visible cost. Final renunciation of the script feels inevitable from prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via pattern-teaching (signal→footprints→crystals), with legible tightening at vial-cracking opening the door; Conceptual Repricing closure reweights contact as chemical sampling with undeniable cost in theft ("any true return required theft"). Orientation anchored early (tower arrival post-contact). No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, POV-biased details like "volatile terpenes, as if the forest...still breathing" and glittering footprint powder constrain choices (scraping slide matches signal). Rainwashed setting persists post-rain to guide path, charging final chamber image. Micro-setting (pedestal crystals) alters tactics at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chemical homecoming vs. council script) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening (signal→catalyst→binding chemicals), forcing agency in vial-crack and theft. Cost legible in foreclosed obedience ("report a different chemistry"); one tightening suffices, protagonist-driven under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as "measurable convergence of volatile molecules" emerges organically from particulars (terpenes, dyes, Pilgrim Salt), reweighting myth/management in CR closure without moralizing. Final shard-pocket answers central question via image of rewritten footprints, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (chemical lens: "microcrystals arranged like tiny ladders") biases noticing; stable first-person distance modulates with intensity (teeth ache harmonics). Archivist dialogue natural/subtextual. Rhythmic compression heightens under stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "footprints...glittered in my lamp" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts dulling closure. Figurative language coherent/patterned (bronze quiet echoes visuals), propels without overwriting in peak (door-seam reveal).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of biochem homecoming (Pilgrim Salt binding "chemicals...from childhood rooms") transforms first-contact trope via specific lab-rebel lens; risk in elliptical discoveries heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at theft-closure. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
