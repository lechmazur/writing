<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied triggers like wildflower scent evoking mother's voice; contradictory impulses peak in defying council despite gravity risk, earning final restoration choice with grief's visible cost. Father's forgetting anchors personal motivation without backstory excess. Micro-choices like tying to pipe reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from grounds pattern to chamber discovery and beach release; mosaic shards taught early via recurring patterns, transitions legible. Closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page with whale sinking and father's recognition, cost legible in "lived-in sorrow." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt chamber constrains choice (ties to pipe amid floating tools, sealed drain); recurring lanterns/pier filter through dock worker bias, evolving with gravity shifts. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under urgency: brine threads, glittering silence swallows sound. Final beach throbs reverse prior gleaming quietness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening revelations (jars as archive, parasite bargain); agency in exhuming jars forecloses deletion path. Tightening at slab-chipping gravity reversal narrows options with embodied cost (hair lifts, throat blade). Cost unmistakable in grief's return charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-as-erasure emerges organically from particulars (pockets feeding parasite, jars preserving grief); final image reweights premise—silence now "lived-in sorrow"—without moral. Subtext in fluctuating pull mirrors internal deletion/return tension. No tidy binary; complexity lingers in consent's burial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature: patterns (grounds, flames bowing) bias noticing; rhythmic texture modulates with pressure ("silence shone so hard it felt like a blade"). Stable POV, no leakage; foreman's whisper carries subtext naturally. Prose as character reflects lantern lighter's steady gaze amid surreal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "crystals rose like glass cities" advances setting/action/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in chamber beat taught as pattern, pays off without muddle. Propulsion aligns with beats, closure image crisp.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: whale parasite bargaining grief via gravity pockets/memories-in-jars transforms surreal tropes into inevitable logic. Risky mosaic/lyric surrealism heightens stakes coherently; final reconfiguration ("whale sank into ordinary weight") feels earned from particulars, not template.</comment>
