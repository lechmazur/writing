<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as coral witness roots her shift from mourning to measuring, intensifying to compel skiff trips and secret-tapping; contradictory impulses peak when she wants to argue hiding routes is a lie but revelation strikes harder, earning her final renunciation of open truth for restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from suspicions to beacon schedule realization; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands in taped palimpsest and tapping rhythms, reweighting paths as timed with conceptual cost of managed restraint legible in "drifting moored."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Station's glass well and tide-timed beacons constrain skiff choices and charge final reef-freckling image; sensory hierarchy (water slap, fog, tapping echoes) reflects Mara's measuring priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vanishing paths deepens accumulatively through lunar wait and fog taps, narrowing to timed canal revelation; agency in assembling/rewriting forecloses open paths with cost of restraint felt in final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of restraint for recovery emerges implicitly from timed beacons and palimpsest, reweighting loss as "periodically eternal" cycles; final image of freckling reef offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (millimeters over mourning) modulates with fog tension; brief dialogue natural/subtextual, voice textured in "drifting in its leash like a patient animal."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short tap sentences amid longer builds); purposeful metaphors like "pale bones slowly freckling" cohere without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-ban timed paths and tapping codes transforms erosion tropes; "beacons lit again... periodically eternal" turn feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
