<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's disguised wisdom shines in the lieutenant confrontation, where babbling and orrery nudge reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final chart-sealing choice earned by prior stitching causality with exposure cost, though brief Kest limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density builds to beacon alignment and transmissions surfacing; Charged Poise closure in sealing/sending chart reconfigures options with held-breath tension cost legible in "echoed silence" shift; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory's orrery and eternal flame constrain choices—flame reveals possibilities, orrery synchronizes—charging final held-breath image; autumn leaves and sensory echoes filter through Liora's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel coup via unheard stories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through alignment reversal changing knowledge; Guard intrusion forces agency in nudge/slip, with exposure price felt, though lieutenant exit slightly deflates peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden stories vs. official lies emerges organically from stitches/transmissions, resonant non-literal answer in final "city could still choose another story" reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in held breath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Liora's thread/star noticing; dialogue subtextual ("stars giggle") advances plot with code; stable close-third POV, rhythmic modulation under stress, though minor elevated diction in code exchange borders register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., flame over orrery advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in "whispers from under ice" metaphor slightly muddles peak reveal coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery/orbitals unraveling multiversal conspiracies feels inevitable, risk-taking in "adjacent possibilities" transforms tropes; bold premise commitment heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
