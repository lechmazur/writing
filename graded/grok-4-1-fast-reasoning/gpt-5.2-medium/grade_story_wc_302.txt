<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of caution and joy embodied throughout (slow breathing amid glow), culminating in earned mailing of apology after self-revelation as voice-thief. Interiority particular via memory's sleepwalker wandering and fear-swallowed sentences. Final renunciation of silence forecloses path with felt emotional cost, unmarred by flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: delays and reversals build density to CR closure where "his own" name reconfigures premise—he stole his voice—with undeniable conceptual cost in "invitation" realization. Orientation anchored early (attic, vellum letter). Taught pattern of flips/delays pays off cleanly at cipher unfolding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Watch as recurring object constrains choices (backward steps, lag-marking) and library's wet/warm air, humming blanks charge final mist-glow image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (light pulses timed to table). Purposeful selection mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover unspoken words) signaled early, accumulates via decoding reversals to tighten into self-naming turn that narrows options and crystallizes agency in mailing. Escalation driven by protagonist's delay-measurement under lens; cost legible in foreclosed fear-silence. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-stolen voice emerges organically from cipher-revealed "SAY WHAT YOU NEVER MAILED" and own-name invitation, reweighting prior swallows without statement. Final "LIBRARY IS WHERE YOU DARED TO SPEAK" offers resonant CR answer with lingering ambiguity on consequence. Particulars like unsent sister apology ground complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in timing/delays (stutters, lags, flips) modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable single POV. Purposeful compression of elisions taught early via watch pays to closure glow. Diction controlled, biased to unspoken hums and mists.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands cyclically reversed every thirteen minutes" advances plot/sets constraint); varied rhythm flows read-aloud. Zero loops/artifacts; figurative purpose-built ("shelved with bottled dawn") without muddle in peak decoding. Propulsion matches scene acceleration to revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unreliable watch unlocking unspoken library transforms trope of lost voice into self-theft via delay-cipher, inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in nonlinear time/patterned elision heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes; particular reversals/ mists anchor originality.</comment>
