<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction between analytical precision and self-deceptive drinking compels the admission on the bench, earning the closure choice with embodied cost via the snapping punch. Flaws drive inevitable progression without safety-hedging; micro-choices like kneeling at the seam reveal values hierarchy. No therapy-speak flattens peak; voice specificity elevates to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as crack-arrow density tightens to stairwell admission, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure: fortress door of "stacked, unwritten letters" reconfigures evasion into inward mapping with conceptual cost of voiced truths. Orientation anchors early (riverfront station, night); no lens ambiguity or unkept setups. Single tightening suffices, pattern-taught from pavement onward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist lanes and pavement seams constrain choices, guiding to fog door and rails; starlight pins "route markers" charges final star-dust image. Sensory hierarchy (dew-glimmer rails, fissure arrows) reflects mapper's bias without catalog; spatial choreography coherent through descent. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal faults without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dare to phantom platform proving Midnight Line) signaled early, accumulates texturally to admission tightening that forecloses silence with punch-cost. Agency in following arrows narrows options; conductor's "unless you arrive honest" crystallizes moral calculus at bench. Price legible in snapped crescent hole smelling of ink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cracks as inward arrows emerges organically from map scraps and dodged truths gallery, resonant in final "mapping the first corridor by the star-dust on her shoes" reweighting silence vs. change. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in open fortress without tidy binaries. Particulars like flask-pocket card anchor epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature analytical-artistic (detours "like watercolors," tiles counted); rhythm modulates from mist-gathering lanes to train's silent arrival. Conductor dialogue sparse, subtext-heavy ("Fortress of unspoken truths"); no head-hopping or filter excess. Diction reflects mapper's idiom under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short punch-snaps amid flowing mist); no loops, scaffolds, or metaphor muddle—starlit vault coheres without violation. Minor figurative density in tunnels gallery purposeful, pattern-taught early; rhythm varies read-aloud, closure image crisp. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-train trope via pavement-arrow logic and truth-fortress payoff feels inevitable; risks lyric compression heighten inward stakes without gimmickry. Cracks-as-maps transform mystery unraveling organically; no derivative echoes, bold premise commits fully to conceptual rules.</comment>
