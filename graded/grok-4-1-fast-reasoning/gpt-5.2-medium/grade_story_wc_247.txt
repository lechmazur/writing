<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via grief threading into joyful rhythm during foghorn rush; final endurance of pauses earned by causal mapping with felt cost of sliding recognitions. Interiority concrete and embodied in ribs ringing and palms flashing memory. Aster's guidance forces micro-choices revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds via mapping points to foghorn cavern, tightening to music sharing closure (Charged Poise) with cost in evanescent recognitions. Orientation anchored early in harbor by moonlight. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of absence shapes tactics to resonant final image of camera offering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting of quay, bollards, pier constrains mapping choices sequentially; foghorn pause and rope hush charge final accordion swell. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to pauses amid gull cries. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal absence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming name via silence tightens accumulatively through foghorn deepening, forcing rushed signing that narrows to music trade-off. Agency in offering notebook forecloses erasure path with legible cost of brief, sliding eyes. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sound-from-silence emerges organically from mapping events, reweighting forgetting premise in final refrain stitching recognitions. Returning camera shifts from empty ache to metronome/proof without moral state. Subtext in gestures like signed apologies invites ambiguity of partial presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in framing absences and signing pauses; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity from slow choreography to foghorn rush. Single first-person POV stable, no head-hopping. Voice as character: syntax poetic yet grounded in embodied noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "lanterns like floating commas" advancing atmosphere/action; rhythm varies naturally, propulsion strong to closure. Minor figurative density in peak foghorn beat pattern-taught without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign-language silence-mapping to harbor music transforms invisibility trope via specific camera/accordion logic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
