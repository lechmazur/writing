<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lior's sentimentalism embodied in ear-to-gear listening and rootfiber harness shows particular interiority; parental patterns create contradictory impulses acting in knot-tightening hands. Final outskirts choice renounces furnaces with felt cost, earned by prior arithmetic trust. Minor backstory summary dilutes one micro-choice peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of petal sighs, gear grooves, bark observatory to CR closure: wheel glow reconfigures patterns with "troubling" cost of blamed youth. Orientation anchored in Nebula Garden para 1; transit shards legible, no debt. One tightening via automaton warning narrows homecoming options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nebula Garden constrains transit (sight-failing gas forces sonar); recurring petals/sonar charge final wheel image. Sensory hierarchy (bone-read echoes, moth strain) reflects Lior's priorities; bark observatory evolves causally. No white-room; micro-setting (gear-stone, reed-wand) guides choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break patterns, light sans fire) signaled para 1, tightens via automaton warning forcing slower-path trade-off. Agency in gear-offering and child-teaching forecloses furnace return with relational cost. Accumulative escalation reweights via shared-wheel image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Generational loops emerge organically from coiled vines, parental echoes, to final "promises a future that might finally break the loop" without stating moral. Petal/gear motifs shift (mute to radiant) charging CR; ambiguity lingers in "troubling" gentleness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (petals as memories, grooves "glimmered without heat") biases cosmic-sentimental; rhythm modulates from serene to shiver-charged. Automaton dialogue hushed/subtextual advances stakes; no head-hopping, distance stable for Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: "moth strained in thin gas, pulling the harness, and the gear began to spin" propels via varied rhythm. Selective metaphors (starvines coiled as ancestors) purposeful, no muddle; minor petal-reprise risks template but patterns taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gear-to-radiance synthesis transforms exile trope via nebula sonar transit; risk of lyric Accumulative structure heightens pattern-break ingenuity. Final shared wheel inevitable from gear/observatory particulars, no template echoes.</comment>
