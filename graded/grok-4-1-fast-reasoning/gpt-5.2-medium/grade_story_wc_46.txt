<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in polishing where he breathes apology into shard, earning vow's shift from punishment to purpose with felt guilt cost. Interiority concrete via embodied weighing of memories palm-to-palm. No unearned epiphanies; change scales to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from grotto entry through memory drip to pearl's glow as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring light-sharing with emotional cost legible in unflinching neighbor gaze. Orientation anchored early in Lio/grotto/night. Single scene fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's tide pools supply constraining sea glass shard; flat rock enables scale/polishing, charging final pearl image refracting starlight. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (star charts vs. surf). Details evolve causally with mist/echoes mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (light sans fire) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as polishing loosens memories, forcing fear confrontation and purpose crystallization. Agency in sphere-shaping forecloses punitive vow path with visible apology cost. One deepening sufficient; pressure coheres to village hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pearl's calm glow offers non-literal answer to fire-fear premise, reweighting sharing as communal hush without moral state. Emerges from particulars like sea glass dawn-swallow. Ambiguity lingers in "sea had done most work."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct star-watcher perceptual signature in "nights felt like sealed ink" and wave-breath sync. Third-limited stable, rhythmic modulation heightens polishing intensity. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in child's whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "felt an odd heaviness... quieted thoughts" advances character/atmosphere). Rhythmic variety in read-aloud; metaphors coherent (zephyr/serpent). Zero loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle at closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: earthbound astronomer's no-fire pearl from sea glass transforms redemption trope, inevitable via prior guilt/polishing logic. Risks lyric accumulation without gimmick; village bloom heightens stakes organically.</comment>
