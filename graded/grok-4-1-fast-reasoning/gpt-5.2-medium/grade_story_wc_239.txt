<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in witnessing empires/stars mistaking illusions drives arbitration, with embodied micro-choices like tracing spirals and measured footfalls revealing internal contradiction. Mirrors' "possible pasts" force simultaneous impulses, earning unification at center. Minor abstraction in epiphanies ("truths could be unified") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via spirals narrowing arguments from mirrors to center, yielding CR closure where "mirrors dissolved into plain stone" with grief-cost ("hiding behind my grief") legible on page. Orientation anchored early (witness post-hiccup in temple). Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hush/incense/dust filters through POV, with well/mirrors constraining arbitration choices and dictionary charging final image ("pressed to my chest"). Micro-setting (spirals on pages) mirrors internal narrowing. 9+ test: recurring dictionary shapes tactics/closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel illusions) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mirror loops tightening contradictions into overlaps. Agency in speaking terms/admitting costs forecloses illusion paths with felt price. Pivotal center-step crystallizes under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unifying contradictions emerges organically via spirals/mirrors, reweighted in final "cosmic fog thinned" without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to illusions in stabilized definitions. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature ("wanderingly exact," biased noticing of spirals/hush). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity (fluttering pages to creaking library). No elision issues; 9+ test fully met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively without loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere around spirals/mirrors. Minor figurative density ("hiccup ran through the universe") in opener slightly overwrites but purposeful. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-history arbitration via spirals transforms cosmic tropes through lived inward/outward pattern. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight. Non-obvious moral calculus on illusions elevates.</comment>
