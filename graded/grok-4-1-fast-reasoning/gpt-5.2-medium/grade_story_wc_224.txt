<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's buried name-making talent creates internal contradiction, embodied in numb hands and throat-shutting pain, compelling the raw memory seed with visible cost; seer pressures via unexpected feather method. Final choice to carry pain without trading earns change, resurfacing talent to pin reality. Contradictory impulses act on-page, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seer's reveal to nightly shuffle, culminating in Charged Poise RR as aisles shift but naming pins path, with seed-memory cost legible in throat pain and rumble. Orientation anchors early (climb to bookstore post-painful recall). Closure on-page with undeniable emotional price shapes exit image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves, mica-spined books, hidden thunder constrain navigation and charge shuffle beat; feather as micro-setting enables texture-reading turn and compass-like reprise. Sensory hierarchy (prickling quill, tasting metal) reflects seeker's biased priorities. Details evolve causally (wetter depths, blurring shelves), mirroring internal states without overt symbols; setting pins final door.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stone for home's shape) signaled early, tightens via talent reveal and seed under Accumulative lens: density cadence shifts to midnight pressure, narrowing options as shuffle forces naming agency. Cost unmistakable in raw goodbye spill altering tactics; one deepening forecloses lies-for-mercy path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bearing untraded pain emerges via donated-memory aisles and raw seed vs. nightly substitutions, reweighted in protagonist's resurfaced talent translating stone to true home-curve. Final basalt doorway image offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in first-person POV, perceptual signature in soundless grammar and feather-texture noticing; rhythm modulates from aching softness to fast-naming propulsion. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (seer's apology, warning), advances via method reveal. Distinct diction/syntax reflects stressed mind without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shelves rose like cliff faces" advances setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, thunder motif coherent without muddle. No loops/scaffold; propulsion accelerates in shuffle beat. Minor figurative density fits taught pattern, unslipping closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-donation archive shuffling reality nightly, unlocked by feather-texture/naming talent, transforms homecoming tropes via underground gift and seed-cost. Risky labyrinth-shuffle pins ingenuity in hindsight; bold premise commits without retreat, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
