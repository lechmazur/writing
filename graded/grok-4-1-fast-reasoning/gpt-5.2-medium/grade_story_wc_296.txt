<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of warlike serenity propel micro-choices like tracing circles amid cold seizing lungs; final stance protecting conjurer earned by causal discovery of twin's apology, with visible cost of standing against spears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via because/therefore: conjurer's seed prompts dawn row, circles open vortex path to ice coffin discovery, reversal unbends lid for DC closure; cost legible in thawing twin and "years of ice" paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex and mirror-shards cage constrain entry/exit choices; reed staff traces rings on water, apple-smell air filters through druid priorities; final shards show "dark water behind it," charging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover mirror-truth tightens via descent discovery of sprouting seed, forcing seed-feeding agency; reversal narrows options under causal lens, cost felt in mutual devouring and curse-lifting tide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges via plant devouring "what the mirror hid," reweighted in final "dark water... honest at last"; resonant non-literal answer in released lost things without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic compression like "branches circling in disciplined fury"; stable first-person filters urgency, modulating rhythm under stress without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery like "reed staff... humming" into action; no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies (short descent sentences accelerate); minor figurative density in opening fits taught lyrical pattern without muddling peak unbending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vanity-plant hungers and circle-reversal unbending transforms mirror/curse tropes; risk-taking in vortex descent and seed collision feels inevitable, heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
