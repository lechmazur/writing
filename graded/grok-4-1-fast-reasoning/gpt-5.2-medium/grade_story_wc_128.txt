<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mara's shrewd scrutiny spotting the envelope versus her "careful kindness" choosing the longer route, compelling the proposal; final funding commitment earned with commission cost. Eli's secondary pressure via embarrassment forces reciprocity. Flawless embodiment avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of notes builds to CR closure in "letter slipped...reached Mara again, she smiled at the repeating error," reweighting cycles with conceptual cost of error perpetuating kindness. Shards (meeting, weeks later) transition legibly; orientation anchored early in concert exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breezy library under stars constrains choices (Eli's late sorting, open readings host chain); recurring wind "flipped pages as if applauding" charges final library image, mirroring compassion's cadence. Sensory hierarchy (salt, fog, ink) POV-filtered through broker's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uplift silent hands without vanity) signaled in urge to "lighten it," accumulatively tightens via proposal/chain; agency in funding forecloses neutral path with commission cost legible. Final loop forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cycles emerge organically from particulars (Eli's note, locket sails, chain); final error-smile reconfigures premise non-literally, reweighting errors as compassion's vehicle with lingering ambiguity on sustainability. No moralizing; irony gaps (mistaken addresses) deepen.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whimsically attentive even in crowds," sea-whisper synesthesia) biases noticing; stable 3rd-limited POV, rhythmic modulation under joy ("tidewater"). Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (Eli's condition), idiom-distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "careful blue ink" advances gratitude beat); rhythmic variety, no loops/artifacts dull closure image. Metaphors consistent ("tidewater" urge), purposeful for voice; zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mistaken envelopes transform chain trope into inevitable cycle, error as engine; fresh broker-volunteer crucible risks sentimentality but grounds in occupational grit (tariffs, commissions). Final loop inflection hindsight-earned.</comment>
