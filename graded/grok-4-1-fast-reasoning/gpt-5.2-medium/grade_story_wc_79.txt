<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quietly driven trait roots motivation in pattern-reading skill, compelling micro-choices like whistle-testing and gate-chalking that earn the final step; embodied dread in "sunwashed dread" shows contradiction without epiphany; no stock phrasing, flaws in isolation balance competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern discoveries densify to CR closure—gate as "mouth clamped shut"—with cost in "sunwashed dread" and expedition's fate reweighting options; orientation anchored by para 1; no lens ambiguity, persistent shell-pattern constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Turtle shells as "pages" constrain choices via pattern language, mirroring internal drive; sensory selection (salt light, rust flakes "like burnt petals") filters through cartographer bias; final alignment charges mirrored city image without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (question watchers) signaled para 1, tightens accumulatively via journal spirals narrowing to gate-rivets realization; agency in stylus-cracking and chalking forecloses isolation with dread-cost; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of land/city as speaking patterns emerges organically, reweighted by CR—watchers as gate teeth pointing to mirrored city—offering non-literal answer to isolation question; ambiguity lingers in expedition's "eyes bright" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (pattern-biased noticing: "scallop to mean water") with rhythmic diction modulating to compression in peak ("rust flakes fall like burnt petals"); no head-hopping, elisions taught via mapping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("thin note shivers through the stone, and dust leaps"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (shells as "pages") integrate without muddle in closure beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of turtle-shell city and pattern-grammar transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in abstract "language" concretized through cartographer's agency heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
