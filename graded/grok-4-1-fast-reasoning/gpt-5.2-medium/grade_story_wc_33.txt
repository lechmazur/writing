<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivo's motivation roots deeply in linking mail absences to heal promises, shown concretely in fostering Nela and confronting smugglers; contradictory impulses (respectful bows vs. cart blockade) act simultaneously. Final foster promise endures with treason cost, earned by prior micro-choices like signing the form. Nela applies immediate pressure as fragile parcel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: absences linked to map gaps → stairwell confrontation → bottle uncorked for drone takedown → reprogrammed flight → Mendery reply reconfigures options. Charged Poise closure in "healing did not mean undoing" with treason cost legible in final step toward gate. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in arcade/mail drop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's shattered skylights and coin changers constrain choices (roof launch, stairwell block); thunderstorm bottle as micro-setting charges climax. Sensory hush (neon dead, footfalls held) mirrors brittle stakes, evolves with rain burst. Twilight pressures lone drop timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal promises via mail) signaled early, tightens via Nela foster and absences linkage forcing confrontation; agency in bottle release forecloses violent path with drone cost. Escalation causal under lens narrows to treason trade-off, visible in "councils called it treason."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending via delivery emerges from mail absences, bottle bend, drone plea; final image of recorked bottle and border step offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like Mendery seal reweights promises' value.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in mail-as-parcel metaphors biases notice (e.g., Nela's thin envelope hand); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to thunderstorm burst. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("polite good evening" to lookout).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "thunderstorm in a bottle" setups relic and stakes); varied rhythm propels from hush to slam without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent (brittle hush recurs purposefully), no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mailman detective via absences + relic bottle bends drone border rules organically; risk in polite rebellion heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via promise motif. No template echoes; cobalt arcade inflects dystopia uniquely.</comment>
