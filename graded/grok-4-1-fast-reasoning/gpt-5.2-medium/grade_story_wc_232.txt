<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal cavern choice earned by Mara's consistent empirical intuition (ants as "experiment") and embodied conflict (anger at silence, recognition of shared loneliness in Ellis); micro-choices reveal values hierarchy with inheritance foreclosure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain from tin box decode ("coordinates, not font sizes") to cavern slab tightens options; closure DC lands on-page in wet passage choice with felt cost ("water licked her calves"), reconfiguring promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming cavern and rising creek pools constrain path choice (SET/DISTRIBUTE) and charge final emergence; ants line as micro-setting guides entry and frames unafraid march image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rising creek escalation (pools seep, patter through holes) under causal lens forces trade-off agency; cost legible in solo climb ("water licked her calves"), charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("ants still marching, unafraid") offers non-literal CR repricing "doorway of decisions" as stepping moment, reweighting typesetting promise from vellum note without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with map-dealer's perceptual signature ("traced the words like contours"); rhythm modulates tension (short sentences in climb), dialogue subtextual (Ellis's "form can still be changed").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels causal beats (e.g., "antipodal" fungi lilies advance stakes via surge); zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figures without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Matrix chip coordinates to hidden press transforms printing/maps tropes into choice crucible; risky ant/experiment motif heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
