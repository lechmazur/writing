<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in lens darkening (doubt vs. intuition anchor), compelling higher-stakes micro-choices like tracing spirals; final endurance earned by mother's legacy and on-page risks. Interiority concrete (tasting words, warmed paint). No safety-hedging; flaws complicate without tidy arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries (spiral, shadow, hatch) builds to RR closure—"the seam held steady, anchored by intuition"—with legible cost in restored lens light vs. prior darkening. Orientation anchored early (market, seam). Pattern taught, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring lens fragment constrains choices (darkening raises stakes) and charges final image (joined flare, both cities). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (salt language tasted, cold light breathed). Market micro-setting tactile, guides hatch access.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keep seam open for names) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lens failure and deepening discoveries narrowing options; agency in lens use/unfastening forecloses doubt-path with felt cost (eternal instant risk). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked histories emerges organically via painting voices and name-carrying; final image ("seam held steady") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting anchors/intuition without moral. Subtext in implied counter-readings (council forgets).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (mist wets hands, paint warms) biases noticing toward seams/hidden details; rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences at hatch). Stable first-person, no leakage; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "shard caught sunlight and split it into a quiet rainbow that seemed to stop time"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent/purposeful (mist, drowned stone). Propulsion aligns with beats; zero scaffold in peak (lens join).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (seam translation via paintings/lens) transforms tropes through lived intuition/cost; risk-taking in accumulative shards heightens seam stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
