<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rin's illustrator traits concretely drive pattern-spotting sketches that enable cadence-breaking climax; pendant obsession yields embodied contradiction between curiosity and Giant-waking risk. Orren as secondary pressures method with cost. Final uncaging choice earned by prior thefts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens: Orren's method → time thefts → throat descent → deliberate cadence break yields CR closure ("echoes are born where endings are refused") with repayment cost legible in final count. Orientation anchored early (studio, canals, Giant). No shards; single drive holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rooftop canals constrain pole-boat travel to jaw tower; throat's warm drafts, bars, sound-pool charge choices and final ferry image. Sensory bias (illustrator patterns in breath, condensation) mirrors internal hunt. Evolving details (backward canal clay → stolen seconds thicken air) integrate via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Echo-Forge access) signaled early, tightens via time-borrowing agency narrowing wake-risk options; cadence lock forces ethical trade-off (break resolution). Escalation causal under Hybrid lens culminates in uncaging with Giant-sigh cost viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of refused endings emerges via interrupted stories → cadence lock → deliberate break yielding echo freedom, reweighting pendant/time motifs without statement. Final pool whisper and child-echo reprise non-literal answer to echo-birth question with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (ink-fingers noticing repeats, sketch-marks patterns) biases details character-specifically. Sparse dialogue goal-driven (Orren demonstrates, explains cage). Rhythmic prose modulates with descent stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer sensory propulsion (e.g., "pendant loops sank like hooks") without loops or scaffolds. Varied rhythm breathes with stakes (short taps at lock); metaphors coherent (clay canal backward flow). Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: Giant-nap city + throat Echo-Forge + cadence-lock unlocked by musical theft transforms tropes; risk in time-interest payoff inevitable from Orren demo. Bold premise coherence heightens echo-birth stakes without gimmick.</comment>
