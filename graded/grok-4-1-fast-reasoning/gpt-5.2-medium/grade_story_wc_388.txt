<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" compels journey and exposure with embodied tension ("hands go cold"), but internal contradictions act more sequentially than simultaneously, limiting 9+ depth in pivotal orchard entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain excels: letters → coordinates → orchard discovery → ledger → mailing creates CR closure with legible cost (agents seize evidence but truth disseminated to rivals); orientation anchored early in workshop, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid wasteland details ("dust storms rose like walls") constrain journey and charge orchard image where "grit circled but never fell," mirroring internal quest and enabling intuitive boundary cross; body/respirator anchors choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. ministry lies) signaled early, tightens at orchard revelation narrowing options to theft risk/exposure; agency in mailing forecloses safety with agents' arrival as felt cost, but one tightening suffices without micro-turn overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth amid "comfortable lies" emerges organically via beacon-diamond reweighting curse to detector, resonant CR in "Stillpoint of fact" reconfiguring liquidation premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read the land the way a debunker reads a hoax") biases details sharply; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("curse" vs. "beacon"); rhythmic control peaks in silence "world stop humming," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("rows of apple trees, leaves glossy and unburned"); minor metaphor density in opening ("sky tasted like pennies") risks slight overload but integrates without obscuring closure image; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc conspiracy via flawed diamond-beacon and stillpoint orchard transforms tropes; risk in mosaic shards pays off in hindsight inevitability of truth's dissemination.</comment>
