<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation through rune rituals and deliberate micro-choices like tracing rings instead of forcing; interiority concrete and particular, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal beats like the reservoir dip, tempering exceptional tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ritual density building to CR closure where Liora joins her shadow ("completing a ring that joined her own shadow to the rest"); cost legible in mentor's self-sealing and shadow forfeiture, one tightening via automaton's pointing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via mural crack stair and keyhole shape, charging final pool image; sensory hierarchy rune-specific (loop "in her teeth," air of "iron and cold tea") filters through scholar's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows' path) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through sliding shadows and reservoir reveal narrowing knowledge; agency in loop-closing forecloses linear haste with felt cost in personal shadow sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "closing loops" emerges organically from spoon-twisted circles to final rune-ring, resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing; shadows' storage offers non-literal answer to noon question via charged pool image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-biased noticing ("loop she could feel in her teeth"); rhythmic control modulates deliberate texture under ritual pressure, stable single-POV with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "wound the heart-spring until the little figure clicked upright"; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figuratives (light as "water and sometimes like stone") enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spoon-bent reality into loop mechanics transforms fantasy tropes; bold risk in ritual progression inevitable via "knowledge returns by closing loops," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
