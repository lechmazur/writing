<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maras motivation to transmute pain roots consistently in traits like perceptual calm, driving micro-choices like aligning arcs despite grief; contradictory impulses in secret plan versus public subtlety act in scene; final collective earning via towns hands shows visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as alignments densify from solo pins to communal hangs; orientation anchors by para 2 (Briarwick, factory ruins, lavender); closure RR via Charged Poise in final image of field breathing with shared masterpiece, cost felt in transmuted hurt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and fence constrain choices (pins, scanning pallet, storm-rattled sheets) and charge final breathing image; sensory selection (scent softening metallic taste, candle halos) reflects POV urgency; ruins/vines evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (build doorway memorial) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via towns shoeboxes/joining then storm endurance narrowing options; agency in arc placements forces trade-offs; cost legible in holding sheets through rain, charging final walks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared hurt emerges organically from arc alignments joining losses; final image reweights premise non-literally ("our hurt without flinching"), resonant via particulars like hook-to-veil match; ambiguity in "if the town wants one" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with arc-focused perceptual signature biases noticing (curves answering curves); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("A doorway, if the town wants one"); rhythmic diction modulates from calm catalog to flickering intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., arcs trace emotion while advancing plot); minor figurative density (curves/laugh lines) in early beats but pattern-taught and purposeful; no loops, propulsion varies rhythmically to storm cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puzzle archiving into arc-collage memorial transforms grief trope via photo alignments (hook completing veil); risk in communal whimsy heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from arcs motif constraining closure.</comment>
