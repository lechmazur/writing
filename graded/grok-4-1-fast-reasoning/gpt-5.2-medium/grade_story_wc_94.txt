<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil," earning the final renunciation of louder speech with father's betrayal as visible relational cost. Interiority particular via timed exposures revealing paternal shame. Lysa applies crucible pressure without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of plates builds to CR closure in "new atlas in which every absence had a place," reweighting censorship premise with conceptual cost of measured light over speech. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; father's note revelation pays off early envelope setup without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory domes "wet as black pearls" and timer "like a small altar" constrain ritual choices, charging stalled star image as "wound that refused to close" mirroring scars. Sensory hierarchy narrows to thunder and second-hand crawl under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to name scars tightens via father's confession deepening personal cost, forcing endurance of mixed emotions; agency in stuttering breaths on plates forecloses direct confrontation. Accumulative escalation via ritual repetitions reweights options without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scars-as-durations theme emerges implicitly from timed plates and father's coordinates, resonant in final "measured light, a storm-kissed wonder that could not be neatly blacked out" reconfiguring censorship without moralizing. Particulars like timetable anchor counter-reading of betrayal as guidance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in stormlit metaphors ("rain that falls straight down through still air") biases toward timed revelations; sparse dialogue goal-driven ("do not photograph them, time them"). Rhythmic control modulates from crawl to dawn cadence without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "second hand crawl like an insect along a rim of light"; figurative coherence serves textural lens without muddle in peak ritual beats. Varied syntax propels from ascent to descent; zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms censorship trope via darkroom scars and paternal timetable coordinates into fresh CR of plates as oaths. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early vigil setup.</comment>
