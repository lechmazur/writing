<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when paper triangles tempt Mara with pyramid lies, but she volunteers her memory for truth, earning the first diamond with embodied shame-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as pressures/confessions build density to closure CR: chain of diamonds forms from shared truths, reweighting futures with "ache of those parallel selves" cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mushroom glow "like a submerged city" and bolt constrain choices (mounting, diamond-threads); final touch in "shadowseam light" charges image, sensory bias via Mara's alchemical reading of air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (farm debt to diamonds) signaled early; text-prompted tightening from solo to "share the load" communal confessions narrows options via agency, with confession-cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honest alchemy emerges organically; final bolt-touch and aloud promise reweights quantum premise non-literally, resonating parallel ache without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("reading the air for the weight of words"); rhythmic lyric compression taught early, modulates pressure coherently to closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm; figurative consistency ("pressure into diamonds") purposeful without muddle, though opening metaphor density borders overwriting but serves textural lens payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of physical concepts, pyramid ghosts, quantum texts transforms tropes; bold premise fully committed, inevitable hindsight closure via glitch-guided communal diamond-chain.</comment>
