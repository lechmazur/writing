<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's frostbitten creativity conflicts with insatiable drive, embodied in gray sketches; admitting Nela's illness prompts essence pour, earning restoration via drawn fruit with vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: essences accumulate to seed swell ("drop landed with a sound like a bell underwater"), forming doorway RR; before/after reconfiguration legible in healed Nela and replanted seed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Verdant parapet crack hosts pear tree drinking spray, constraining root-drinking placement; mist beads shears and braids jars, charging doorway seam in wet stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore blue via wonder) signaled early in gray ideas; admission and pour deepen under textural lens, narrowing to world-crossing agency with fear-sharing cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wonder-through-care theme emerges via pruning-translation and "painted mask" warning; final orchard "brighter without shouting" reconfigures premise non-literally, weaving worlds enduringly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("ink the color of their scent," sap's thoughts bottled) biases sensory hush; stable distance modulates to dawn without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image ("threads of light that stitched into a doorway"); varied rhythm propels hush-to-dawn cadence, zero loops or muddled figures at peak crossing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Essence-jars from pruned buds synthesize orchard magic into world-weave healing; risk of backward current and fear-drawing feels inevitable, transforming tropes boldly.</comment>
