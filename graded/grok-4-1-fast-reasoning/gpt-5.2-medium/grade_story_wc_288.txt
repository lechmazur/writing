<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied guilt ("My stomach tightened") tying past-life memory to present revelation, earning final renunciation of resurrection with micro-choice to copy imperfectly; contradictory impulses (isolate vs. connect) act in scene at stone circle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density (tides, hums, scripts) tightening to moa names revelation; CR closure in "pages wrinkled, but the meaning held" reconfigures isolation with legible conceptual cost of imperfection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vapor cycles and stone circle hum constrain choices (low-vapor descent, breath-shifted hum) and charge final image (wrinkled pages); sensory hierarchy (teeth-vibrating hum, warming metal) reflects POV priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled early and deepens via agency-driven revelation (sets sundial, speaks aloud) under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in brittle warning forcing imperfect copy that forecloses perfect memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coexistence theme emerges organically from moa guilt to refuge instructions, reweighting isolation as "spacing"; final non-literal answer in "kept the hum in my bones" resonates without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (moa eyes in sundial light, hum in teeth/bones) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from library crispness to circle vibration, stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "shadow move even though the sun was behind a thick lid of cloud") with varied rhythm and zero loops; figurative language purposeful without muddle in peak revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation guilt, tidal world, and humming instrument transforms extinction trope; risk-taking in cloud-rim circle payoff feels inevitable, heightening stakes via personal moa link.</comment>
