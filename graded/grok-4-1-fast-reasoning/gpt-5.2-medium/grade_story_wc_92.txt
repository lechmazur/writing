<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calm inventiveness compels higher-stakes micro-choices like fooling Captain Orven with the quill holder while secretly picking the lock, earning the final endurance with felt risk; minimal simultaneous contradictory impulses slightly limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal actions building textural density) holds through inventive linkages to Charged Poise closure in "every lock still intact, yet none truly theirs, and the Cradle of Sparks would sit empty, smiling," with legible conceptual cost of emptied cache and undetected shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial's coded angles and raw wood peg constrain the spark transfer and shadow alignment, charging the terrace action; selective sensory details like "shadow drew a sharp line anyway" mirror inventive calm under blackout pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silent revolution tightens via blackout opportunity and Captain Orven's inspection, forcing sleight-of-hand trade-off that narrows options with visible risk; agency drives escalation without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet subversion emerges organically through particulars like dimmed corridors and "satisfied click," offering resonant non-literal answer in empty Cradle's smile without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gates became a mouth clamped shut," "listened for teeth") biases toward mechanical intrigue, stable first-person distance; brief dialogue with Orven carries natural subtext and goal pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety propels through poetic compression like "sparks inside tick against its metal ribs"; no loops or artifacts dull closure, though minor metaphor density in opening risks slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of lock sentinel's revolution via sundial codes and stolen sparks transforms tropes of rebellion into tactile, silent mechanics; fresh "winking hush" tone risks boldly without gimmickry.</comment>
