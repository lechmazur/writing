<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in boredom as cowardice drives earned choice to step through; embodied curiosity and frayed patience layer realistically. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("boredom was a kind of cowardice") borders therapy-speak but anchors prior micro-choices. Maris applies precise pressure via confession without overshadowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: amulet tugs lattice therefore corridors mutiny therefore Ilias translates hum into path. On-page CR closure ("immortality peeling away... become part of what remains") with undeniable conceptual cost in final image. Orientation anchors immediately; single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prismatic walls constrain climax by showing goodbyes, charge final image; sensory hierarchy (ozone/old letters, tilting corridors) reflects dimensional urgency via POV bias. Micro-setting (magnetic lattice, glass prisms) guides choices without tourism. No white-room; evolves causally with mutiny.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (after goodbye) tightens via causal agency: presses amulet therefore maps routes, narrowing to single slit with immortality cost legible in peeling image. One decisive escalation suffices; storm/mutiny complicates without resolving. No abstract stakes—all visceral on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: goodbye as severance reweighted by final field of moments where "space stops obeying you." Resonant non-literal CR answer without moralizing; particulars (overlapping Maris reflections) invite ambiguity on endings. No tidy binaries—embraces loss complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (translates magnetic hums dimensionally); voice modulates rhythm under stress (shortened sentences in mutiny). Dialogue subtext-heavy (Maris confession pursues evasion-to-truth); distinct idioms. No head-hopping; elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: every line advances (e.g., "fragment tugged... colors shifted" propels causality). Varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (bruise sky, twitching space) without muddle. Read-aloud propulsion peaks in climax without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spatial mutiny + goodbye dimension feels inevitable from particulars; tropes (immortal quest) transformed via magnetic physics. Bold risk in CR closure heightens stakes; no derivative templates—fully committed premise.</comment>
