<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotions (tremor in ribs, knees loosen) and micro-choices (labeling memory shards) reveal helix-minded specificity under pressure; final endurance as archivist earned via prior causality. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("synaptic plasticity") borders therapy-speak but stays anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to Charged Poise closure when rock turns translucent and she descends, reconfiguring inheritance with felt cost of ongoing entanglement. Anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and periscope mirror constrain choices (descent guided by quaking reverie) and charge final image (translucent rock with histories); selective sensory filter (shale gnaw, copper warmth) mirrors internal wiring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sort memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via helix modification revealing mother's scene; agency in rehearsing forecloses severance path with cost of managed entanglement charging descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance over madness emerges organically from entangled shards and helix motif shifting to "clean angle of return"; final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with helix-biased perceptual signature (spirals climbed, synapses rewired); rhythmic texture modulates from chaotic precision to charged poise, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-stacking; figurative helix pattern purposeful without muddle in peak (thumb to crack). Minor overwriting in memory spill but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh dream-mines premise transformed via node-mirror entanglement and synaptic archaeology; bold risk in lyric world logic heightens stakes organically to inevitable descent.</comment>
