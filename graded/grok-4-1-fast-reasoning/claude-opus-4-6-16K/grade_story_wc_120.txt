<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between fortune compression and symphony expansion acts in sustained notation-writing; embodied stress (trembling hands, softening vision) particularizes endurance to earned completion with exhaustion cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from shell-guided method through 11-hour work to dawn CR; cost legible in "She was exhausted. She was finished." as bodily gravity forecloses rest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spire and frozen lake's mirrored horizon constrain vertigo stake, evolve causally to dawn prism throwing color on pages, charging final ice-light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exhaustion timeframe tightens endurance agency via accumulating signals (caffeine tremble, vision edges soften); one deepening forces completion trade-off, cost felt post-score in final suspension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nautilus shell and notations reweight memory's silence from compressed fortunes to expansive score; final hush-blood image answers homesickness non-literally as "remembered forward" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Musical diction and perceptual bias toward unheard sounds create distinct signature mirroring fortune craft; stable close-third POV holds under stress without elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax to dawn seep ("first as pain, then as recognition"); figurative spiral/nautilus taught early, no loops or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious fortune-notations as memory-symphony synthesize compression craft into sound-map; risk of invented score system heightens stakes organically to shell-hush closure.</comment>
