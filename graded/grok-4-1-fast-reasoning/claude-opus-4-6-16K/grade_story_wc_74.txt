<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's methodical hope and insomnia drive concrete micro-choices like logging symbols and persistent painting, culminating in the earned sleep with visible cost of foreclosed wakefulness. Interiority embodied in gasping from visions and hand "remembering" symbols. Contradictory compulsion to paint despite exhaustion acts in scene, fueling final message.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: symbols accumulate via moonlight visions to connection with Deshi, landing CR closure in sleep and message reweighting lost languages as kindness with insomnia cost legible in "for the first time in eleven days she felt sleep rousing." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlight constrains visions and charges final image among "tomato plants and wet canvases"; smog-city rooftop greenhouse tactile and selective via POV (cracked tile, slanted columns). Sensory hierarchy narrows under insomnia urgency. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crack symbols/end insomnia) deepens accumulatively via pivotal vision of Deshi's hand, narrowing to message and sleep with felt cost of prior nights lost. Agency in searching forum and writing persists under pressure. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of kindness as pre-word language emerges from particulars (carried canvases, identical symbols), resonant in final CR without moralizing: "the language we are writing is the one that exists before words." Invites reflection via ambiguity of visions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (symbols "burning behind her eyelids," moon "blade of pale gold") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from urgent painting to quiet close. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture or image, e.g., "smog had turned the skyline into a bruise that never healed." Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent and purposeful in peak vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: estate-sale brush links strangers across cities/years via symbols, transforming lost-language trope into kindness memory with hindsight inevitability. Bold risk in accumulative visions pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
