<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in concrete interiority and embodied motivation ("trembling with foxglove regret" reveals values under loss); endurance earned via accumulated failures. Weakness: minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene limits 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "hundreds she had failed" and final "That had to be enough." Orientation anchored early (Opal Library above clouds); one tightening via gallery-wide flicker suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring tube constrains choices (struck for Elowen, emotions, unbidden close) and charges final image; setting vivid, selective (petrified light, vapor stairs mirror isolation). Micro-setting integrates tactile use without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fading echoes) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed orchids to momentary all-light flicker forcing stance crystallization. Cost felt in isolation and losses; one deepening reweights without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. inevitable erasure emerges organically from actions/images; final "silence returned... faithfully alone" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior losses without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical bias toward echoes, fading); rhythmic control modulates from systematic calm to charged flicker. No elision issues; prose as character reflects aching precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/scaffolds, varied rhythm propels (short punchy affirmations vs. flowing descriptions); figurative coherence ("bruised peaches," "watercolor in rain") enhances without muddle in peak flicker beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fading names/feelings in glass orchids, cracked tube as imperfect savior transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via tube's reprise.</comment>
