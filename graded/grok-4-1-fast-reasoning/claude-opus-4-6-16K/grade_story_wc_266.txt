<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in Maren's white-knuckled grip on the frayed leash and her voiced regrets compel the final wade; guides apply precise pressure without archetype overload. Final renunciation earned via path's accumulation. 9+ test met cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: path density builds to shoreline crest revelation, Charged Poise closure in wading with "door" opening inside her—cost legible in foreclosed leashes. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridgeway and fog constrain via star-punches; twilight vigil and shoreline water charge final image, sensory hierarchy (amber lanterns, warm water) POV-filtered. Micro-setting (leash, heather) mirrors internal release. 9+ test: recurring fog/stars constrain and recharge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim courage post-loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via guides' words and path to cadence shift at crest; agency in following/wading forecloses safe restraint with felt emotional cost. No escalation slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patient courage emerges via particulars (leash snap to star-lights drifting); final shoreline image resonant non-literal answer reweighting regrets without moralizing. 9+ test met: reconfigures "leash" premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (fog as veil/door); dialogue subtextual ("Courage doesn't vanish"), rhythmic control modulates from fog tension to water release. No head-hopping; elision purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring path curves; metaphors consistent (water patience, star windows) without muddle. Zero loops; rhythm peaks at "breathed in... free," read-aloud flawless. 9+ test: no artifacts, propulsion charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis: leash-loss to star-punched ridgeway vigil transforms grief into textured release; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via patient light/water motifs.</comment>
