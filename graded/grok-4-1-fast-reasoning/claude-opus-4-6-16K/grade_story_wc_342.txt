<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between obsession and acceptance act vividly in the scene, culminating in the earned choice to leave sketches entombed; interiority particular via fractal geometry perception. Motivation to mirror the sky roots consistently and compels the final renunciation with felt cost. No diagnostic labels or tidy paths undermine the flawed, competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of coin details and realizations to CR closure: leaving sketches forecloses full capture with conceptual cost in "entombed in the oak when it fell." Orientation anchors early in oak library; single scene coherent, no causality breaks. Cost legible in final pressing of coin and walk away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tree trunk library constrains via carved shelves and bark crack filtering light, charging final shudder image; sensory details (hush, rumble) selective and POV-biased to geometry over faces. Micro-setting (coin against knot) mirrors internal limits purposefully. No white-room; lived-in navigation integrates with retrieval.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to retrieve coin/sketches signaled early, deepens accumulatively via realization of limits narrowing options to renunciation; agency in leaving drawings forces trade-off with visible cost on page. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in oak shudder as she walks. One tightening sufficient, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of limits as wonder emerges organically from coin fractals to sky realization, resonant non-literal answer in final line reweighting premise without moral. Particulars (indentations, sketches) build complexity; ambiguity lingers in endless approach. No sermonizing; counter-readings plausible in obsession's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in topological faces; diction/rhythm lyrical yet controlled, modulating to compression under demolition pressure. No head-hopping or withholding; perceptual bias character-specific. Prose as mind: syntax echoes fractal precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short final sentences propel); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak realization. Strategic telling anchors reflection efficiently. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly; read-aloud propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face-blind fractal portraits via coin indentations synthesize fresh premise organically; tree library and limits discovery transform tropes boldly without gimmickry. Risk in quiet CR heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from early particulars. No derivatives; singular vision.</comment>
