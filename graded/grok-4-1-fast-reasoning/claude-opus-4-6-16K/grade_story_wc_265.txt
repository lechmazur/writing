<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in weeping from recognition and pressing gear to forehead, earning change; motivation compels micro-choices like placing gear under tongue; single-POV voice coherent with no flaws touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from translocations to gear/wind decoding to canopy cradle RR/CR; cost legible in "shock of recognition"; orientation anchored early in baobab automaton.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest vivid/selective, with tin leaves, brass bamboo constraining perception and charging final canopy image; wind sounds filter through POV urgency; micro-setting (gear, cradle) shapes choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mind's frontier) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via hum-guided listening to wind meanings; agency in attention/gear placement forecloses doubt with emotional cost in weeping; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from wind-song philosophy and gear alignment, resonating in final hum exchange without statement; "spool releasing thread" image reweights particulars non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (hum as vibration, wind notes in sternum); rhythmic prose modulates from description to awe; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at canopy payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; specific verbs/nouns propel (clicked/whirred, shimmering whisper); figurative like "eyelashes" teeth purposeful, no muddle in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thinking forest via wind dialects and sixth-sense hum/translocation; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable at canopy reconfiguration.</comment>
