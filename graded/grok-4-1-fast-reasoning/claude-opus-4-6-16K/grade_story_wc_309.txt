<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—skill inadequacy vs. faithful clumsiness—act in the mist-step beat with keystone, earning the closure weeping as renunciation of academy measures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from journey shards to summit memory-press, delivering CR in "The light held through the night. It was still glowing when the sun returned" with emotional cost legible in tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Keystone and mist constrain climb choices ("mist shifted... responding... to her willingness to believe"); spire summit charges final glow image with frost-lashed isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of soul-residue vs. construct emptiness tightens accumulatively via frost-embodied endurance, foreclosing perfection path; agency in belief-negotiation culminates in undeniable glow-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final keystone glow reweights imperfection-as-sacred without moralizing, resonating through contrasts like "construct-light blazed, sterile... This was a dim radiance, warm and stubborn."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("Each step was a negotiation with impossibility"); no loops, purposeful figurative layering supports textural lens without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of faith-mist vs. automated perfection risks lyric ascent, transforming trope via lingering light's irreplaceable conceptual payoff.</comment>
