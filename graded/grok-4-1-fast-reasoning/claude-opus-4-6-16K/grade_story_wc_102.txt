<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied through breathing tides and chalk dust weeping; motivation intensifies from resisted curiosity to compelled seeking, earning final softening of grief as continuation. Contradictory impulses (artistic isolation vs. spiritual pull) act in shards, culminating in micro-choice to sit before the tear. Final renunciation of isolated grief feels earned with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via light-chasing shards; mosaic structure (silo → weeks → viaduct) taught by first 25%, transitions legible through question's thread. Orientation anchored by para 2 (Elara, pinholes, Kyoto silo). Closure as CR: final image reweights unused love with conceptual cost of eternal continuation, legible in "pouring back now, transformed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (wisteria breath, rust-time inhale) filters through artist's inverted gaze; viaduct constrains by suspending light for breathing reveal. Recurring pinhole/dark chamber charges final image, mirroring internal shift. No white-room; spatial choreography clear across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (love's storage) signaled post-silo, accumulates density via sutras → monk → tear, deepening to architectural sensation that forecloses isolated grief. One tightening: breathing reprise narrows to compassion-fabric realization with felt cost in chest-softening. Agency in pilgrim pursuit under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "unfinished that was always meant to continue."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformed love emerges from particulars (child's hand, tear's glow, light-in-dark); final stream-river image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences (no touch), ambiguity lingers in "perhaps only twilight." Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: light-truth bias shapes noticing (inverted blossoms, pinhole rehearsals). Lyrical texture modulates rhythm with intensity—short oceanic breaths in peak. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in shards legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance image + emotion), rhythm varies (tidal slows to held-breath pauses). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; overwrites purposeful in viaduct ("violet clusters hanging so heavy they seemed to breathe"). Zero artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura as metaphor for past-life/pilgrim inversion transforms tropes organically. Risky mosaic shards heighten stakes via accumulating "foggy" knowing to lucid CR, inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity in love-compost.</comment>
