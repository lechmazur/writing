<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied grief via censer foot reveals character-particular interiority and contradictory endurance; final micro-choice to listen anchors values hierarchy with visible emotional cost. Minor reflective summary dilutes one beat but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern build (building, calls, signal) to CR closure where signal reconfigures loss as navigable, cost legible in "ache travel up her arms into her chest." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via "Listen" call suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen dishes and censer foot as micro-settings constrain actions (leveling, pinning charts) and charge final image; sensory selection (savage stars, cold bronze) reflects POV urgency and biases perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hear Lila's trace) signaled early, textural escalation via moon/signal intensification forces endurance with cost in perpetual chase; agency in building/climbing tightens coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shaped loss emerges via particulars (coordinates line, signal breathing); final image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting absence as textured presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable limited third with grief-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation (groaning dishes to whispering signal) heightens pressure, diction controlled and voice-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "soldered connections, spliced cables"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, purposeful figuratives like "sunflowers tracking a dead star" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of SETI grief with "reverse migration" and loss geography; risk-taking lyric CR transforms tropes, feels inevitable via censer/signal accumulation.</comment>
