<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Persistently curious trait drives anomalous case pursuit and incidental shift to protection, with contradictory impulses (curiosity as affliction vs. heroism) acting in the holding scene; final renunciation of filing tonight earns closure cost through embodied tenderness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as signal density builds to atrium encounter and fades with mist lift; on-page Charged Poise closure ("She did not let go until... protecting this one vulnerable voice was enough") reconfigures curiosity into heroism with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and twilight constrain timing and visibility, narrowing to bench encounter; hearing aid as micro-setting charges pulses tracking; final mist lift mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing anomalous signal tightens accumulatively to thinnest voice encounter, forcing endurance/renunciation; cost legible in sustained holding amid fading twilight, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Incidental heroism emerges organically from particulars (signal trace to embrace), with final image offering non-literal resonance on love's persistence without moralizing; reweights premise via vulnerable voice protection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (e.g., pulses as sonar, bonds' textures); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("He's still reaching"), distinguishing fragile woman from assured tracer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports accumulative poise; minor figurative density in mist/light images purposeful without muddle; no loops, clear propulsion to closure hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh heart-tracing premise synthesizes grief tech with lyric mist-world; risk of analog hearing aid as instrument transforms tracer trope into inevitable, voice-bound closure.</comment>
