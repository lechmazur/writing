<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's affectionate skepticism drives persistent micro-choices like tracking heart rate amid doubt; contradictory impulses act in "I'm always the data," earning relational endurance with visible cost in Jonah's flinching mornings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns build from shock to photographs; Charged Poise closure in final shutter click reconfigures boundaries with cost legible in "fragile as willow glass, precise as fractals."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Muscovite sliver as micro-setting constrains choices by angling for somatic responses, charging final image; studio's blackout and wavelengths filter perception purposefully through Maren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to isolate signal via sensation tightens accumulatively through data (heart rate down 12%); agency in devising forecloses unmapped territory with ongoing cost in hand-grip and flinching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mapping brokenness to home emerges organically from light patterns shifting to "hopeful lines"; final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, reweighting skepticism and belief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in fractal/neural imagery; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, as in Jonah's "That's not data... That's just you," distinguishing voices under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety accelerates process beats; no loops or scaffolds, purposeful figurative layering like "dendrites of refracted color" integrates without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy bleed and light-painting therapy transforms tropes through specific somatic/light mechanics; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes to inevitable "way home" reconfiguration.</comment>
