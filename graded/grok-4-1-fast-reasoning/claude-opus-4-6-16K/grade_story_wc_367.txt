<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in laughter as response to unbearable/wonderful storms, embodied in teeth-sensing gales; motivation to shape dawn compels nightly endurance with felt grief/joy cost. Minor slip: prophetic trait verges archetypal without deeper flaw-driven mistake compounding pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from routine to prophecy; Charged Poise/CR closure in "steered into existence, one reflected beam at a time" reconfigures formless world with luminous grief cost legible on final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse's internal reflection panels constrain lighting choice and charge final beam image; sensory details (wind pouring gallery, shadows pooling) filtered through prophetic POV, evolving with flame ignition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to shape dawn escalates via prophecy beat ("ships will come back"), narrowing to endurance under accumulative lens; cost felt in shadowed elation, though single tightening lacks micro-turn agency spike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light-including-shadow emerges organically from routine and prophecy, final image resonantly answering new world's terror with non-literal reconfiguration; no moralizing, ambiguity in grief/joy lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in storm-speaking, shadow-dancing diction; rhythmic control modulates from descriptive build to prophetic gasp-song, stable close-3rd POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., wick description integrates tech/history/action); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or muddled metaphors, read-aloud ear sings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inward-gathering lighthouse, accidentally prophetic sails-of-questions prophecy transforms mystic tropes; risk in poetic texture heightens stakes, inevitable in shadowed elation payoff.</comment>
