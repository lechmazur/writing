<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sable's motivation to resurrect via engineering shines in mapping redirected flows, rooted in consistent curiosity; embodied in kneeling at junction and pocketing sextant. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, tilting toward idealized diligence without raw internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to proposal approval as Charged Poise closure, with felt cost in "open corridor" amid maze. Orientation anchored early in concourse; one tightening via weeks of modeling sustains drive without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid specifics like jury-rigged power lines and dry fountains filter through Sable's engineering bias, constraining her vision of hydroponics. Sextant as micro-setting charges final desk image, mirroring internal states via inscription.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect terminal) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through mappings to board presentation; agency in stoic proposal forecloses demolition path. Cost legible in "not a yes... open corridor," charging final poise under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maze of intentions emerges organically from carnival hacks, sextant inscription, and proposal; final desk image reweights hope equations with non-literal resonance. Avoids moralizing, lingering in ambiguity of colony's choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with engineering perceptual signature (e.g., tracing piping, equations forming); rhythmic prose modulates from survey wonder to presentation intensity. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, varying sentences; metaphors like water channels integrate without muddle. Minor maze repetitions purposeful for theme, not loops; clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival detritus enabling spaceport reclamation transforms post-collapse trope; risk in blending hard engineering with hope equations feels organic. Sextant arc across centuries adds inevitable ingenuity.</comment>
