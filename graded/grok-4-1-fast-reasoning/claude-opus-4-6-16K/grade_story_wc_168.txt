<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the letter-writing beat ("not going to explain fire... just grow"); final mailing earned by six years of jargon-heavy failures with embodied cost in scarred hands/grip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise RR in envelope-pocket decision; cost legible in "lighter now" against prior unsent pattern, planets reconfigure options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridge slab warmth constrains sitting/writing choice; planets' convergence charges final image, mirroring emotional gap-closing with selective sensory filter (mercury river, granite heat).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pain-translation) deepens via reflection-cadence under Accumulative lens, crystallizing in send/renounce-hoard choice; cost unmistakable in foreclosed box-filling path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Regrowth-shoot image and planets answer "translate pain" question non-literally, reweighting fire-love premise with growth-without-forgiveness resonance in final envelope act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scar-topography and fire-crown sounds; rhythmic compression heightens reflective pressure to closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffolds with high density (e.g., "precision born not from ease but from... absence"); propulsion varies rhythm to charged final image, metaphors coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter scars + unsent letters + planetary math transforms regret trope; risk in quiet RR heightens stakes via irreplaceable box/lid-crack specificity.</comment>
