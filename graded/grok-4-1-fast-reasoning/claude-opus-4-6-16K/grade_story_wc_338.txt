<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via map-framing traits and distinction between "perceptive" and "attentive"; micro-choices like pausing at the "tear" earn final sketch of revelations. Contradictory impulses subtle in methodical care uncovering disruption. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footage comparison builds density to CR closure at underdrawing discovery ("silence was not always peace. Sometimes it was a scream painted over"), with conceptual cost in reconfigured empathy legible on-page. Single scene fits scope; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Henge stones constrain (acoustics mute video/sound) and charge final hum/rain image; rain pressures damage mapping. Sensory hierarchy via cartographer's bias (porous seams, cup-marks). Environment shapes discovery choice at "tear."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to revelation deepening knowledge/options; agency in attentive pause forecloses serene reading with felt reconfiguration cost. Minor slip: stakes more intellectual than visceral, but coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of painted-over screams emerges organically from fresco underdrawing and chapel silence; final ascent image ("let the silence hold what words could not") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting silence/empathy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited POV with cartographic perceptual signature ("maps were just another way of saying"); rhythmic control modulates from methodical to charged ("shielded and open"). No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; varied rhythm propels (e.g., short punchy sentences at discovery). Figuratives integrated (rain "works the painted plaster the way grief works a face") without muddle. Propulsion peaks flawlessly at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography/fresco revelation transforms silence trope via video method; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes. Discovery beat ("mid-cry, and then silenced") inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
