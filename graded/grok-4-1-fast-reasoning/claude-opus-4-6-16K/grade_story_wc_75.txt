<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maret's historically rooted interiority drives micro-choices like foraging and lens-projection, with contradictory dread-action impulses embodied in thumb-pressing the lens. Final endurance of customs earns stasis with visible cost to forgetting. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through precise actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory shards anchor present foraging ritual, tightening to bread-sharing RR/CR where "thaw" reconfigures erosion into charged poise. Orientation clear by para 2; cost legible in stalled customs and "fossil" hope. Single deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's mineral deposits and fungi constrain foraging choices; waterfall's "silver veil" and roar charge opening/closing images. Sensory hierarchy (water mist as dread) filters via Maret's lens. Waterfall roar frames final thaw, recharging motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (arts erosion) signaled early via flour shortage; foraging deepens pressure accumulatively, narrowing to ritual endurance with cost (gray dough vs. rye memory). Girl's question crystallizes stance. Agency in adaptation; one tightening fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance vs. thaw emerges via bread shapes and lens glow; final "K taste like remembering" offers non-literal resonance, reweighting loss without moral. Particulars (initials, fossil hope) drive; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (historical metaphors like "undo time"); rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual. Girl's dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; diction fits cultured voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer senses/action without loops. Rhythmic variety in ritual para; "rosewater dread" purposeful. Minor simile density serves texture, no muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of refugee arts-ghetto and bread-letters custom; waterfall-grotto transforms displacement trope. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in thaw-image; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
