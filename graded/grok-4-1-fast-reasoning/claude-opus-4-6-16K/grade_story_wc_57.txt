<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through seed analogies and embodied patience (numb fingers, aching knees); motivation compels endurance with visible cost in final coil and walk. Contradictory impulses in philosophical drive vs. physical toll act simultaneously on dock. Final renunciation of haste earns preservation stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot decodings build density to CR closure in "rope like a scripture," reweighting knowledge with preservation cost (footprints filling). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via successive patterns (lichen, net, lullaby). No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Golden dock, fog curtains, muffled bell constrain patience and charge final hush; fulgurite/recurring rope illuminate twists, mirroring internal decoding. Sensory hierarchy (tactile numb fingers amid visual prisms) reflects POV priorities. Dock edge subtly guides coaxing action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/preserve) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through knot yields ("breath caught"); weather forces endurance trade-off. Agency in coaxing narrows options to transcription/coiling with physical cost legible in knees aching. Final image crystallizes pressure without resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of encoded knowledge emerges organically via seeds/rope/fulgurite particulars, reweighted in final "scripture" image without moralizing. Lullaby knot offers resonant non-literal answer to preservation question. Counter-readings (junk vs. scripture) embrace complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (bristlecone embryos, S-twist) stable in third-person limited; syntax/rhythm modulate from patient wait to hushed closure. Compression taught early via knot syntax pays off legibly. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density (each line advances decoding/atmosphere); rhythmic variety peaks in "world... held in an oceanic hush." No loops, artifacts, or muddled figures; purposeful metaphors (snow remembering) enhance without overwriting closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed collection/knot-language transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric accumulative form heightens stakes via cormorant witness and hush. Final footprints reconfigure humble materials premise inevitably.</comment>
