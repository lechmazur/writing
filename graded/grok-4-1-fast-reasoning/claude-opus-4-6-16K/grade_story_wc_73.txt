<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist's contradictory impulses (hopelessness named yet steps chosen) act in scene; dice roll and proof completion earn final step-forward with cost of foreclosed freedom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds to CR closure: chipped die's blank zero ruptures proofs, collapsing helix with conceptual cost of "boundless confinement" reconfigured in single step.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Helix landings with equations constrain proofs and charge final compression image, mirroring internal ascent until rupture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of capturing decision-texture escalates via incomplete proof to dice-deepened rupture under textural lens, agency in completion foreclosing climb with stillness cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "grim optimist never does" image resonates as non-literal answer to confinement-optimism tension, reweighting proofs without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (textural/math bias in "chipped corner where six met five") modulates rhythm under climax stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; "steps began folding like pages of a book being closed" images climax without figurative muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chipped die's impossible zero synthesizes math-chance-ascent into inevitable rupture, transforming trope with risk-taking closure payoff.</comment>
