<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seraphane's motivation rooted in tide-dancing skills compels the inscription with embodied grief ("eyes open and her grief intact"); Dorin applies pressure as steady volunteer. Minor abstraction in internal conflict, but micro-choices like mixing moonstone reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from exile setup to tattooing; closure as Charged Poise in "Spontaneously anchored... founding something" reconfigures options with cost of ending drift. Orientation anchored early in garden; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden as blind spot constrains surveillance evasion; stars/soil pulse charge final anchoring image, filtering through Seraphane's gap-observing bias. Sensory selectivity (soil pulse, ink shimmer) mirrors internal shift without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory inscription tightens via tattoo act narrowing exile's provisionality; agency in inscribing forecloses drifting with felt anchor cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens via density reweighting regime threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of indelible memory vs. erasure emerges from stellar inscription; final "tide dancer had found her shore" resonates non-literally, reweighting exile without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with tidal perceptual signature ("gaps in the tide"); voice modulates rhythmically from fluid exile to solid founding, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Longer than any law").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("needle moved in tidal patterns"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "star dying into a new medium" enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms nostalgia-ban dystopia via star-tattoo memory encoding; fresh synthesis of tide gaps and celestial verse feels inevitable, risking lyric density for charged poise.</comment>
