<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in navigation expertise, with contradictory wonder/caution impulses acting in the chain-link scene; final shift to student earned by weeping realization, foreclosing surface knowledge with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in journal entry; "every edge is a horizon waiting to unfold" reweights premise with conceptual cost of prior ignorance legible on-page; orientation anchored early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Benthic city and bioluminescent gel constrain perception and charge final "city breathe" image; edge geometry details filter through Yael's navigator bias, evolving with neutrino charts to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to learn neutrino navigation tightens via chain-link beat, narrowing options from teacher to humbled student; agency in persisting/volunteering yields felt cost in weeping, reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of deeper navigation emerges organically from chain to journal, with final image offering non-literal resonant answer—"stars have always been beneath you"—reweighting surface premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in navigation metaphors; rhythmic control peaks in "unfolded horizons" realization, modulating intensity without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors like "frozen lightning" spires enhance without muddling closure image of gel rippling outward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutrino starlight and edge geometry transforms first-contact trope; risk in benthic alien navigation feels inevitable, heightening stakes via Yael's humbled realization.</comment>
