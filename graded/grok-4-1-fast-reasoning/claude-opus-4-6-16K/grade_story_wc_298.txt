<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reckless idealist trait drives notebook trade at climax, earning closure choice with contradictory impulses (grand life vs. belonging) shown in embodied chest-knot release; Keeper's fiercely gentle refusal warning reveals under pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descent builds to barter tightening, closure as Charged Poise in "something loosen in her chest" with notebook cost legible on page; orientation anchored by ~50 words, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glowing apples and roots-in-bones constrain careful movement and charge final ascent image; sensory hierarchy (amber/ash light, marrow soil) mirrors internal hole via POV bias, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim desire) signaled early, deepens via Keeper's exchange demand narrowing options; agency in notebook trade forecloses false-meaning path with felt chest-loosening cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reckless repair vs. tender patching emerges implicitly from barter and "room enough to ache" image reweighting prior hole-widening without moralizing; subtext in card reprise avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (cracks as prophecy, glowing fruit as soul-patch); Keeper dialogue subtextual ("You burned your card") advances stakes, rhythmic control peaks in warning line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (roots "cracking skulls"); varied rhythm breathes with descent-to-barter acceleration, zero loops or overwriting in peak exchange despite figurative density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard premise synthesizes gothic barter with emotional specificity, transforming family-trope denial into notebook pyre; risk in dusky fantasy heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
