<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in the chest-aching longing for the music box melody versus ritual discipline; final renunciation of isolation (carrying jar to town) earned via prior sound-gathering micro-choices with trembling hands as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sound-density buildup to layered chorus; Charged Poise closure in sealing the gallon jar and stepping toward town reconfigures isolation into outreach, cost legible in "trembling hands" and "sand in his beard."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Jars as micro-setting constrain recording choices and charge final image of carrying "against his chest like a lantern"; dune breathing and grass-whistle vividly filter through poet's sensory priorities without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translator redemption via sounds) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to multi-jar chorus narrowing isolation option; agency in dawn recording forces trade-off with town vulnerability, cost felt in final step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of bridging generations via discarded sounds emerges organically from jar labels and layering; final image ("lantern" jar to children) offers resonant repricing of absence into hunger, reweighting prior losses without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sound-perceptual signature ("tern cry," "thunder over the marsh") stable in third-person limited; rhythmic modulation peaks in chorus beat, no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "salt crystals form on rope" advancing texture without muddle; varied syntax propels to closure, zero loops or scaffolds even in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound-jar ritual transforms vagrant poet trope into fresh synthesis of tech-poetry; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable "gleaned redemption" closure image.</comment>
