<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between governance belief and linden evidence act in scene via embodied leaf-turning; final witness-shift earned by blight-exposed flaws with cost of relinquished control. Interiority concrete and particular, rooted in plant-military metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in final trellis image reweighting control premise with cost of "stopped willing." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via notebook pivot suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis constrains as micro-setting, stitching rot and sheltering ferns, charging final repeated stance; linden leaf veins fractal-mirror internal division purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. release) signaled by blight/linden contrast; accumulative deepening via volunteer shifts narrows options, agency in micro-choices like deadheading cessation forecloses governed path with nursery-loss cost legible throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ungoverned thriving emerges organically from linden/moss particulars; final leaf-holding image non-literally answers control question, reweighting arc without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in fractal veins/troop metaphors; rhythmic modulation heightens reluctant turn without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (root vs. stone), propulsion via varied syntax peaks in "unshackled" closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh ecosystem lens on midlife arc transforms cultivation trope; risk in quiet release sustains closure without gimmick.</comment>
