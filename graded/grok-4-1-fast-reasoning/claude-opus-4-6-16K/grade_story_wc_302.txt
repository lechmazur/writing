<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through embodied caution ("heart racing beneath the discipline of careful steps") and micro-choices under pressure (timing cycles with watch); final unveiling earned by accumulating revelations, confronting flaw of veiled sight with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations layer density toward CR closure ("She removed the veil"); orientation anchored early ("Library of Unspoken Words"); cost legible in personal transcription turning into her own letter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and glowing shelves constrain choices ("carelessness could collapse the whole architecture"); recurring mist cycles charge final image, mirroring internal release; sensory selection (warm paper, rain on stone) purposeful and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcribe unspoken) deepens via mother's revelation, narrowing to self-unveiling under Accumulative lens; agency in documenting forecloses veiled silence with felt cost; one tightening sufficient and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of withheld words emerging organically through ciphered texts and final letter-writing; resonant non-literal answer in "mist carried her words outward," reweighting delays without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing cycles, delays); rhythmic prose modulates from cautious buildup to release; purposeful compression taught early via book cycles, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally (short punchy revelations amid flowing descriptions); figurative language purposeful ("luminous ribs") without muddle, propelling to glowing closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library premise with delay-measuring watch transforms tropes of unspoken secrets; risk-taking in cyclic structure inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
