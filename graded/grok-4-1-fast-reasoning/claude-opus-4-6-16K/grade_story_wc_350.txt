<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's "empathetically decisive" trait shines in listening to objections then acting, culminating in tears at the cue; interiority concrete via chest-resonating fears. Minor limit: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses in pivotal visit. Earned change via prior causality at Brenner unlock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from silos to unified song; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with "weight descended... voices rose" and felt tear-cost. Orientation anchored early in tower/climb; shards cohere to single drive without ambiguity. One tightening via weight find suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass dome refracting "borrowed starlight" and rust elevators as silos constrain climb/division and charge final shared sky. Sensory selective via librarian's harmonic lens; spatial choreography clean in tower/balcony/square. Recurrent stars mirror internal unification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unify via clock) signaled early; accumulative escalation via empathetic overrides tightens at Brenner "something... unlocked," narrowing options with relational risk. Agency in cueing choir forecloses division; cost legible in tears amid success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared resonance over silos emerges via concrete particulars like interspersing voices; final "time... too vast... for any single quarter" reconfigures premise non-literally with conceptual cost of prior isolation. No moralizing; ambiguity in "rehabilitate itself into song" lingers fruitfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (cataloguing voices/pitches); diction/rhythm modulates to peak "braided together in vigorous tenderness." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in multilingual Brenner exchange; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud from hush to "shook the tower stones." Zero loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent ("silos of memory," "heart removed") propel without overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choral librarian restoring multilingual clock amid elevator-divided town; clock-chorus premise transformed via specific 1937 weight link. Risk in accumulative lyric build pays off in unified climax without gimmick.</comment>
