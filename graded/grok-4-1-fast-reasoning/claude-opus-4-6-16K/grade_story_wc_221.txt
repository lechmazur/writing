<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via embodied details like pressing applique to chest and star-breathing perception; contradictory impulses (screaming then sketching) act in flashback but anchor present endurance; final renunciation of lost time earned by family-rooted motivation, foreclosing isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sketch density builds to CR closure where new sketch reconfigures temporal displacement with daughter's compass as felt cost; orientation anchored early (Maren on deck post-collapse); reflection shards taught by viewport hum, legible to poignant payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Viewport hum and star motion constrain unique sketches, charging final image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (temporal crawl only she sees); selective details (fading hum, dead deck) mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism, evolved causally post-shutdown.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection post-displacement) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via letter/compass revealing daughter's endurance; agency in choosing aligned sketch forecloses pariah stasis with relational/emotional cost legible in "unstuck" realization; pressure coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (true north as connection) emerges organically from compass-sketches arc, reweighted in final image without statement; subtext in Lise's slanted handwriting invites ambiguity on loss; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (temporally aware noticing: stars breathing, constellations crawling); rhythmic prose modulates from hummed tension to poise; purposeful compression of reflection shards legible under accumulative lens, no elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stars moved at a pace imperceptible... But Maren had" advances setting/character/stakes); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language (deep water diver) purposeful, pattern-taught without muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Time dilation transformed via personal sketches-as-dataset/family rite, non-obvious moral calculus on displacement; compass reprise inevitable from particulars; risk-taking in lyric sci-fi synthesis heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
