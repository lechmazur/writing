<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's symphonically minded trait creates internal conflict between inner symphony and outer void, culminating in earned strumming choice with madness as felt cost; contradictory impulses act in scene via persistent trials. Interiority concrete and embodied, as in vibrations through fingertips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery to analysis to incremental sound extension, delivering Charged Poise closure in porcelain ring and siskins singing with patience-as-cost legible in "carved a small channel." Orientation anchored early in grove and Quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alder grove and wood constrain choices (living alder for instrument, creek-revealed sculpture); recurring siskins charge final image reacting to sound. Sensory selection sharpens via silence-trained eyes on cracks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via deepening: failed instruments → crack analysis → strumming failures → extending tone foreclosing brute force path. Cost unmistakable in hours of play yielding fragile breakthrough.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient reclamation emerges organically via inverse patterns (cracks to anti-frequency), final image resonantly reweighting silence with "crack by crack" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature ("harmonies rising like sap") stable in single POV; rhythmic control modulates tension to whisper ring payoff, no elisions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density propels via varied syntax mirroring escalation, metaphors coherent ("water carves stone") without muddle in peak strumming beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes acoustic consumption, stress-crack cartography, and anti-resonance ingeniously; risk in "minerite" wood and porcelain node feels inevitable, transforming silence trope.</comment>
