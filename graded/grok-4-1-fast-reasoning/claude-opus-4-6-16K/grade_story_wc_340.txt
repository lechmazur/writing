<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete thrill of connections and embodied tears wiped on sleeve; final realization that ascending feels like being chosen earned by curiosity's micro-choices against melancholy task, with contradictory warmth amid grief. Halse particularized through diary without stereotypes. No unearned epiphanies; voice coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: floor-by-floor revelations tighten knowledge to Charged Poise closure where diary/goggles reconfigure burden as choice, cost felt in "carrying what others could not bear." Orientation anchored immediately in spire/elevator; no shards, seamless causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Icy walls' prismatic beams constrain decoding choice, evolving with elevator motion to charge amber final image; selective sensory hierarchy (light over sound) reflects Maren's priorities. No white-room; spire's scale matches stakes without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode Halse's secrets amid refused task) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via revelations narrowing to personal irony ("she will likely never know"), forcing stance crystallization with emotional cost in tucked diary's heartbeat proximity. Agency in instinctive goggle-use drives all turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges organically from goggles (old love decoding new), reweighting ascent in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer via amber world amid endless floors. Particulars like Ulla's rain-laugh anchor complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in light-noticing bias; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise ("world turned amber and warm"). Prose texture lyrical yet precise, no filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density in lines like "scattered prismatic beams moved across the paper like searching fingers" advances revelation and rhythm. Varied syntax propels elevator climb without overwriting in peak decoding beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of prismatic code/goggles transforms servant trope into inevitable revelation; risky quiet closure heightens stakes via endless floors motif. Fresh inflection in light-as-key feels organic, no templates.</comment>
