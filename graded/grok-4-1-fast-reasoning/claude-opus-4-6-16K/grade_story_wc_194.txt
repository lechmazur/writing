<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's jaw angle and "bridge of intuition" embody precise silence driving micro-choices from crank to ledger; final renunciation earned by blood-knowledge recognition with dynasty cost, though internal contradiction acts more retrospectively than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as crank to waves to ledger tightens discovery; CR closure in taking ledger/handle reconfigures legacy with "last and most eloquent silence" cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sepia room and patina brass constrain via tuned waves felt on skin; golden shadows evolve from fingers to closing book, charging final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to uncover truth deepens texturally via intuition-guided crank to resonant reveal; agency in adjusting frequency forecloses ignorance, dynasty-end cost unmistakable in delivery resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emergent theme of resonant blood-truth via ledger's proud script and final image reweights silence from complicity to instrument without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in wave nodes on skin and amber light; rhythmic prose modulates from musing pause to decisive exit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with "standing waves formed... nodes and antinodes" propelling escalation; varied rhythm, zero loops, purposeful figuratives enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frequency-engraved crank synthesizing acoustician legacy into ledger reveal feels inevitable; transforms secret-room trope via resonance physics risking lyric density payoff.</comment>
