<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in interjection against hush, embodied as pressing thoughts, earning final drawing renunciation of permanence with cost in softening memories; character's chalk rebellion particularized through past defacements and present extension of smeared mandala.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to CR closure—"her own memories soften at their edges—not vanishing, but loosening their grip"—with legible conceptual cost reconfiguring permanence need; single scene oriented early, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics and mist constrain choices, guiding hand in drawing—"letting the grotto's whispers guide her hand"—and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (lilac unease, emergent hush) reflects perceptual urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in mess) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tile hush and interjection reversal narrowing to acceptance; agency in drawing forecloses permanence with felt cost in memory loosening charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from chalk defiance through mandala mess to final drawing acknowledging damage; resonant CR—"she drew. And the mess...meant something"—reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "emotional geometry" of mandala; rhythmic modulation under hush pressure (shortened syntax in interjection echo) distinct and biased toward whispers, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., mist thickening mirrors hush build); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors taught early (hush as wave); minor figurative density in peak but purposeful without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unlearning city, chalk as defiance yielding to hush impermanence; risk in emotional-logic mandala reading inevitable from particulars, transforming trope of artistic rebellion without hedging.</comment>
