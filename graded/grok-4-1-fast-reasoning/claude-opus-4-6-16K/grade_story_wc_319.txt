<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and consistent motivation rooted in dimensional homesickness compel patient endurance; contradictory impulses subtle in waiting vs. chasing travelers. Final stasis earned by prior causal reflection on guardians' madness. No relationships on page, but single-POV voice particularizes feral patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via mist/light patterns holds to Charged Poise closure in final glow passing, reconfiguring homesickness with felt endurance cost ("that was enough"). Orientation anchored by para 2 (guardian, frozen garden); single scene coherent, no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through POV (frost crystals in hair, books mortared in wall constrain territory); mist/ice evolve, mirroring internal ache. Recurring pendant/wall charge final image; micro-setting (frozen fountain as stillness) guides waiting choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriend uncertainty amid homesickness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via book-crack sigh and traveler approach narrowing to glow moment. Agency in patient waiting forecloses chase path with homesick cost legible in "boundaries of light shifted, softened."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from waiting/light motifs, reweighted in final edgeless glow without moralizing. Subtext in pendant's hum and mist-thought fusion invites ambiguity; resonance inextricable from endurance arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (light as "continuation," mist as thought); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged poise. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "mist thickened... book cracked" advances texture); varied syntax/rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Figuratives coherent (ice as patience); zero scaffold in peak (traveler/glow).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dimensional homesickness via light boundaries transforms guardian trope into lyric stasis; risk in abstractly feral POV heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early motifs.</comment>
