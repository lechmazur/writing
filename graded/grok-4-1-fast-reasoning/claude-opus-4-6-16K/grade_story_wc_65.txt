<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via map-tracing and model scrutiny; motivation intensifies through convergence zones vs. past stagnation, compelling the poised choice. Contradictory impulses subtle in grounded imagination balancing data and range. Final endurance of constraint earns closure without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure: "Maren chose, and the kingfisher dove" reconfigures fluid future with conceptual cost of foreclosed paths. Orientation anchored early in spire/role; constraint shapes all tactics. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake mirror internal mapping/depths, constraining solitary reflection; quill as micro-setting charges final dive. Sensory selectivity (iridescent nib, lantern light) reflects cartographic POV. Details evolve to charge "dark twin pointing downward."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mandate choice) tightens accumulatively via models' convergences narrowing safe vs. generative options; agency in quill lift forecloses fluidity with felt generational cost. Pressure coheres without reversal overload; cost legible in "weightless and branching" to dive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of ignorance frontiers seeding cascades emerges via maps/models, reweighted non-literally in kingfisher dive resolving constraint-as-catalyst. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing; final image answers "which frontiers matter" with river reshaping ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cartographic perceptual signature (borders/gaps as sight); diction/rhythm modulate from expansive mapping to compressed poise. Voice texture distinct in syntactic precision mirroring geologist patience; no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer ignorance motifs purposefully; rhythm varies to peak compression in "last breath before contact." Minor ice/river echoes pattern-taught, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ignorance cartography premise synthesizes fresh angle on scholarship; risk in lyric accumulative build to Charged Poise heightens stakes inevitably. Transformation of mandate trope via maps/models feels organic and irreplaceable.</comment>
