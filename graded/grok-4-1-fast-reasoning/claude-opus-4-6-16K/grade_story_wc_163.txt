<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characters vividly particularized through feather compass and rhythm-seeking; motivations intensify via mirrored hermit-wanderer bond, earning feather's abandonment as costed renunciation. Jonah's shadowseam face recognition moment reveals relational crucible without stereotypes. Minor archetype familiarity in nomad-hermit pairing slightly tempers peak distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from astrolabe calibration to comb jellies' cascade, tightening to Charged Poise closure; feather left as "small dark anchor" delivers legible emotional cost in final facility pulse. Orientation anchors crisply by arrival; single scene holds without shard excess. No causality breaks; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome fracture enables pivotal jellies entry, constraining and charging climax image; algae ribbons and water-column iris evolution mirror internal rhythms purposefully. Sensory hierarchy (tidal ache, kelp tea) filters via Maren's astrological bias. Recurring platform anchors feather's final recharge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant belonging stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Jonah dialogue and jellies moment forcing shared stasis with relational cost. One tightening suffices: exhale silence crystallizes options, foreclosing isolation. Agency in feather choice pays visible price without reversal excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Belonging-through-connections theme emerges implicitly from astrolabe-to-jellies density, reweighted non-literally by feather anchor amid "borrowed light." Subtext in silence's "load-bearing quiet" avoids moralizing; final pulse offers resonant answer to transit survival. Complexity lingers in place-letting-stay question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (ley lines in coral, feather constellations) biases notice organically; voice modulates rhythmically from ingenious calibration to pulsed heart. Dialogue distinct—terse biologist vs. connective astrologer—with subtext advancing bond. No head-hopping; elision of sky via refraction serves aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short punchy exhales amid lyrical cascades); zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite inventive "shadowseam." Rhythm breathes with tidal pulse, peaking crisply in jellies' "wandering lanterns." Opening anchors stakes; closer recharges motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned facility, landscape astrology, and comb-jelly fireflies transforms tropes into inevitable rhythm-of-belonging inquiry. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes via "private summer" without gimmick; feather's carbon constellations inflect uniquely. No derivatives; vision coheres singularly.</comment>
