<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirela's gentle persistence shines in concrete actions like "knocking twice, waiting, knocking once more," earning her leadership and the bell-ringing declaration; internal conflict between pride and need layers realistically without labels. Final endurance of anonymity forecloses overt gratitude with communal cost on page. Contradictory impulses in distribution (pride sleeps, hunger eats) act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from first bag to bell discovery ("fingers found something unexpected") to declaration, culminating in RR/Charged Poise where "the ridge itself seemed to hum" reconfigures scarcity into persistent care with conceptual cost of unseen persistence. Orientation anchored early in arbor/ridge; one tightening via bell suffices. Cost legible in final image of accumulated silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor's "curved columns... like ribs" anchors and constrains gatherings, charging closure as bell-ringing site; amplified quiet ("every small sound carried meaning") mirrors internal states tactilely. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (footsteps, creaks over visuals). Arbor as micro-setting enables anonymous drops, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scarcity vs. dignity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via donations to midnight runs, narrowing to intergenerational declaration that forces communal trade-off (give/take without shame). Agency in organizing runs/ringing bell; cost felt in "pride could sleep and hunger could eat." Escalation coherent under lens, driven by endurance with on-page price in persistence through sanctions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of anonymous linked-hands care emerges organically from bag-to-bell progression, resonating in final "accumulated silence of people caring... without needing to be known" – non-literal answer reweighting isolation into quiet strength without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures; bell's design shifts meaning across beats. Satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in quiet details ("tone carried... like a voice remembering"); rhythmic control modulates from calm lists to resonant hum without filter stacks. Speech natural/subtextual ("dignity matters as much as bread"). Distinct texture under pressure, satisfying 9+ test; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("footsteps on dry earth, the creak of a basket handle" integrates sense/action); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "ribs of some ancient creature" without muddle. Final line recharges arbor motif cleanly. Read-aloud flawless, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile scarcity into "amplified quiet" communal persistence, transforming anonymity trope via bell's generational design and midnight rituals. Risk in quiet lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; non-obvious ridge-as-hum final image feels inevitable. Bold tonal commitment elevates (+0.3).</comment>
