<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of trait in wilting skin and steady hands at vault discovery; contradictory loneliness and obsession propel micro-choices like prying floorboards with bleeding fingers. Final public transcription earns change with relational cost felt in mother's lost words. 9+ test met: impulses clash in scene, closure choice compelled by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plate fragment → map → vault discoveries build density to CR closure in gold-leaf transcription, reweighting obsession with legible cost (steady hands amid crisis). No orientation debt; pattern taught early via commission. Cost proof: final image of shining leaf under toxic sky presses undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via failing filtration and dry oasis, mirroring internal aridity; fungal bloom and brass tubes charge vault scene tactilely. Final contrast of gold under glass canopy vs. toxic sky recharges image. 9+ test: recurring greenhouse pressures final act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate lost truths) signaled early, deepens via vault reread under Accumulative lens, narrowing to public delivery with visible costs (bled fingers, solitude endured). Agency in solo quest forces stance crystallization; no reversals needed, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Candor-as-aquifer emerges organically from particulars like unsent letters; mother's raw words layer complexity without moralizing. Final image non-literally answers "where truths go" via posted gold leaf, reweighting premise with counter-reading of small acts' scale. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with calligrapher's perceptual bias (gold leaf, curling plants); rhythmic prose modulates from humid studios to sub-level dampness without slippage. Brief clerk dialogue natural/subtextual. 9+ test near-met: signature strong, elision absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action (e.g., "pryed up floorboards until her fingers bled"); varied rhythm propels without loops or muddled metaphors. No artifacts dull closure image of pulsing gold. 9+ test met: zero scaffold, propulsion peaks cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wilting trait, postal vault, gold truths transforms dystopia trope; risk in solo mosaic shards heightens isolation stakes. Inevitable hindsight: map piecing grows from leaf-gilding precision without retreat.</comment>
