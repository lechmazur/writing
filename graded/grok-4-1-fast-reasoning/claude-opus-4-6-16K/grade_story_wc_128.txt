<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's shrewdness roots motivation concretely, intensifying from envelope delivery to self-funded program; embodied interiority like "knowledge sometimes sat... like a stone" shows contradiction under pressure. Oren applies relational crucible via shared geography. Minor epiphanic summary at end ("learning a different calculus") borders unearned but doesn't touch closure micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: envelope mistake → terrace encounter → initiatives build density to CR closure ("compassion moves in cycles" reconfigures profit calculus with conceptual cost of withheld listening). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (concert hall to library). One tightening via shared dock recognition narrows isolation; cost legible in final terrace image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sea wind "rifled through... stacks," fairy lights, salt air selectively sensory and POV-biased (broker spots handwriting like discrepancy). Terrace constrains choice (open late enables encounter) and charges final image (wind turns page under swaying lights). No white-room; spatial choreography coherent across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging shrewd isolation to compassion) signaled early via envelope whim; accumulative deepening in talk → initiatives forecloses profit-only path with commission cost. Agency in sitting uninvited, funding program; pressure coheres to charged poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cycles emerge organically from envelope → thanks → circle/photo invite; final image ("different kind of music... lives finally heard") non-literal resonant answer reweighting manifests/contracts dichotomy. Subtext in silences (Oren's guarded warmth); avoids moralizing until closure CR, but "offered, received, then offered again" borders direct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: broker notices "cramped, earnest" handwriting, tide table "as poetry." Dialogue natural/subtextual ("That's us... Before I came here"); rhythm modulates from descriptive to terse realizations. No head-hopping; diction fits coastal professional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks—e.g., "eyes widened, and something cautious but exuberant passed" propels via strong verbs. Minor overwriting in "cautious exuberance" repeat but pattern-taught, doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: postal error sparks port-world compassion cycle via Yeongdo dock specificity, transforming thank-you trope into initiatives. No template echoes; risk in summary shard coheres under accumulative lens.</comment>
