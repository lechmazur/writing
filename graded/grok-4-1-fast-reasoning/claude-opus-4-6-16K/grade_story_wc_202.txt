<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Specific interiority shines in "anchors of intuition... pressure change before a storm that you feel in your teeth," rooting motivation deeply; micro-choices like unfastening canvases reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal translation beat, muting earned tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations build density to CR closure: mural dims after translation, reweighting erasure with cost in "history... finally received." Orientation anchored early in market walk; single scene tightens meaningfully via lens press.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via swaying planks and glass-bead canopy refracting light onto script, charging pivotal reveal; lens fragment as micro-setting enables choice. Sensory hierarchy (creaking cables, clove smoke) selective through Maren's priorities, mirroring internal anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor hidden history) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through lens-deepened knowledge narrowing to translation act. Agency in unfastening/writing forecloses secrecy path; cost felt in dimming glow and ongoing city forgetfulness, but lacks sharper trade-off in peak beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging erasure emerges organically via particulars like Oshi's testimony; final image of lens "warm against her hip, carrying its old light into the new work" offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in "names waiting to be spoken back into the air" lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: hidden scripts as "fingerprints left by someone leaning through a curtain." Lyrical rhythm modulates pressure, compressing at "The world folded"; brevity of dealer interaction natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "pressed the lens fragment to her eye. The world folded," varying rhythm without loops. Figurative language purposeful/controlled in translation beat ("words hung... like suspended lanterns"); no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical market and between-worlds scripts transforms trope of hidden knowledge; risk in lyric CR payoff ("eternal instant strung on cables") heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable premise angle on memory via paint residue.</comment>
