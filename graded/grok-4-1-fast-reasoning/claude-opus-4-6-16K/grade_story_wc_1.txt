<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via pattern-seeing (frost geometry echoing symbols); adaptive trait earns final pendant-making choice under self-imposed decoding pressure, with embodied cost of newfound patience shown in held breaths. Contradictory impulses (desperation to patience) act in cataloging ritual. Father's legacy motivates consistently without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost discovery tightens knowledge to coordinates, culminating in Charged Poise closure (pendant hung against stars reconfigures purpose with felt cost of precarious existence). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene window coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon frost constrains decoding choice and charges final pendant image; kiln/glass as micro-setting enable tactic with tactile evolution (molten shaping). Sensory hierarchy glass-artist biased (feathered patterns, light-song colors). Atmosphere tensions stillness with transformation heat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode legacy for purpose) signaled early, deepens via frost key narrowing options to contact/retrace; agency in daily cataloging forces endurance trade-off (patience learned post-attempt). Accumulative escalation reweights with visible cost in pendant's fire/knife persistence charging end image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pauses as transformation spaces emerges via frost/fire/glass particulars, reweighted non-literally in final exhale/pendant exhale (line: "the pauses were not emptiness. They were the spaces where transformation gathered its heat"). Subtext in implied resistance ambiguity lingers without morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, perceptual signature pattern-obsessed (scorch-frost branching); rhythm modulates from stillness to resonant hum. Elevated diction voice-motivated for glass artisan. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., frost motif evolves without loops); varied syntax/rhythm passes ear test, metaphors coherent (light trapped as testament). Minor register elevation fits lyric texture; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frost-decoded fire symbols into glass-encoded coordinates transforms legacy trope; risk in lyric reflection pays off in charged poise without gimmickry. Irreplaceable glass/fire/light logic inevitable at pendant reveal.</comment>
