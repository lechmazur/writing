<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as "creeping normality" noticer is concrete and intensifies through micro-choices like delivering the bread and committing to garden, earning her final renunciation of isolation. Interiority embodied in noticing post office hours and fountain, with contradictory stubbornness vs. uselessness. Sable's gentle heuristic approach forces Maren's insight without directness. Final choice hierarchy reveals values with cost of ongoing resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knowledge density builds from Maren's arrival via herbs to flour revelation to resistance method, culminating in Charged Poise CR where gardening reconfigures her stance against forgetting. Orientation anchored early (Maren entering palace ~100 words). Closure cost legible in "we can't give back what people let themselves forget," foreclosing full reversal. Single scene with no shards fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Overgrown palace and herb trails constrain arrival and guide discovery, charging final courtyard image through jasmine wind and broken wall. Sensory hierarchy (smells of lavender/rosemary/thyme/smoke) reflects Maren's noticing bias. Details tactile/lived: moss-felted stairs, kettle over fire. Recurring herbs mirror resistance, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve noticing vs. collective forgetting) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via flour explanation narrowing options to "uncloak." Agency in delivering bread and choosing seeds forecloses passivity with cost of tenuous success. Moral calculus between undo/uncloak sharpens peak. Cost unmistakable in Sable's head-shake refusal of absolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through ordinary sacred emerges organically via bread-as-evidence/sacrament and herb cracks; final image of eating stale bread reweights noticing as holy without moralizing. Subtext in gentle indirection and silence (no birdsong). Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question of memory preservation. Resonant non-literal answer: sacred waits for stubborn noticers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with Maren's perceptual signature (noticing minutiae like 11-minute shifts). Dialogue natural/subtextual: Sable's "It's evidence" advances plot with implication. Rhythm modulates: short sentences in revelations build density. Diction character-bound, no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "rosemary and sage for those who could still read" advances world/character/atmosphere). No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (stone/river, cat/lap). Rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in final image cadence. Zero scaffold, precise verbs/nouns throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of creeping normality with flour-dulling and guerrilla herbs transforms dystopia into quiet lyric resistance. Risky Charged Poise ending heightens stakes via tenuous cost. Particular details (Korvath sourdough as proof) feel inevitable. No template echoes; bold in ordinary sacred.</comment>
