<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in "absences... like silt in a channel," driving micro-choices like staggered sorting; earned endurance via valve placement forecloses grief denial with exile's cost. Young woman's pressure reveals Maren's values without generic foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fragments builds from personal valve to communal offerings, culminating in CR closure—"gaps are part of the record"—reweighting absences with conceptual cost in final image. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via fishermen suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory tower's neglect—swollen door, cracked impressions—constrains choices and mirrors internal absences, charging final harbor light image; sensory selection (wet mineral air, algae) reflects archivist's bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile fragments) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fishermen's offerings forcing stance on gaps; agency in endurance reconfigures meaning with felt cost of changed harbor, legible in "navigating absences was its own kind of literacy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fractured meaning emerges organically from particulars like valve and eroded sand; final dialogue/image offers resonant CR—"what's missing tells us as much as what remains"—reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with oceanic perceptual signature ("fractured dictation") modulates rhythmically; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing voices; stable close-third POV biases toward spray/tide patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("pale stone... glistening like bone"); no loops or artifacts, metaphors cohere (silt, teeth) without muddle, propelling to charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oceanic literacy and human absences transforms exile trope; valve's reprise and "reactively visionary" method feel inevitable, risking lyric accumulative drive without gimmick.</comment>
