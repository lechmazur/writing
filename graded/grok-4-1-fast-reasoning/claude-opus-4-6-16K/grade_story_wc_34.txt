<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's isolation-driven composition without performance creates contradictory impulses shown in notebooks under cot; final singing choice earned by recognizing parallel in Elin's encoded longing, foreclosing silence with felt cost of seven-year drought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly to graffiti to overlaid messages builds density to Charged Poise closure in courtyard gallery, with legible conceptual cost of isolation's hollowing reconfigured via mutual art; "I AM STILL HERE. PRESS THE PLATE" pivots causality cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and stone walls constrain mural exchanges and charge final gallery image; storm-thinned veil as micro-setting enables ghost's reach, mirroring internal states through mist swirling into listener shapes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unspoken connection tightens accumulatively via decoding discoveries narrowing isolation options; Maren's agency in pressing plate and painting replies drives deepening with visible cost of prior silence confronted on eastern wall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encoded longing emerges organically from flower Morse and lyric murals, reweighting premise in final signal-melody anomalies; resonant non-literal answer via "two women speaking through beauty what neither could have said plainly."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("tinkering devotion, quiet wonder") modulates rhythm under pressure, stable single POV; diction like "driftingly alert, half-dreaming but catching every shift" biases notice to signals and mist purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("lightning split the sky, and in that held-breath moment"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, purposeful lyricism integrates action and image without overwriting in peak storm beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of signal-ghost via electromagnetic veil and Morse flowers transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in art-code dialogue heightens stakes inevitably toward tinker's music box closure image.</comment>
