<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Heartbroken reaper's motivation to name grief rooted in Elias's childhood atlas, with contradictory duty-love impulses embodied in echoing phrases; final shift to "known" earned by crystal-catching micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as phrase echoes build density to crystal formation; Charged Poise closure crystallizes grief-naming with conceptual cost of eleven-year namelessness in "She felt known."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cracked dome fractures light into ribbons that cross-form crystals, constraining the naming action and charging the stone-table tableau of atlas/crystals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of shapeless grief deepens accumulatively as recordings feed dome, protagonist agency in echoing forces crystal-holding trade-off; duty's betrayal cost viscerally felt in warm, laughing crystal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming sacrifice's echo emerges via atlas-phrases-crystals progression; final placement offers non-literal reweighting of grief from cruel ripple to holdable forms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward luminous sacredness ("frozen breath, like captured sound") stable in single POV; diction modulates accumulatively to charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (light/voice → "warm" crystal with laughter); zero loops, rhythmic propulsion peaks in crystal drift without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh reaper-grief crystallization via dome's light/voice alchemy transforms duty-monster tropes; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes in named closure.</comment>
