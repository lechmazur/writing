<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with the "tightening at the base of her skull" embodying discovery under pressure; her motivation to collect wall-heard stories compels micro-choices like probing diaries, earning the final realization without unearned epiphany. Contradictory impulses in valuing whispers over events drive the arc. No safety-hedging flaws; endurance of dreamless urgency feels genuine.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early silo anchoring to closure CR via displaced axis realization reweighting history's center, with legible cost in memory's flattening sans dreams ("the well had gone dry"). Single scene causality traces diary discoveries without breaks; orientation anchored by para 1. Final vibration image crystallizes before/after with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silo's spiraling shelves and "bronze quiet" constrain Maren's solitary work and charge closure via walls' patient listening; recurring wall motif mirrors internal states through tactile perception. Sensory selection (bronze quiet settling like dust) reflects POV attunement without catalog. Body as micro-setting (skull tightening) ties to discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving elastic memory post-dreams—tightens accumulatively via diary deepening to axis insight, narrowing options from rumor to reconfiguration; cost felt in collective wakefulness ("dark room with no projector"). Agency in probing forces stance crystallization without reversal overload. Minor abstractness in dream-loss dilutes visceral peak slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of telling as history's displaced center emerges organically from tapestry sketch and Elda's confessions, resonating in final wall-listening image that reweights events vs. voices without moralizing. Subtext in gold thread vibration layers loneliness amid urgency; ambiguity lingers in survival sans dreams. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature attuned to silences and textures ("murmurs of centuries"); rhythmic modulation builds from quiet probing to charged closure. Prose texture distinct in syntax echoing coiled dragons; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice reflects eccentric attunement without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bronze quiet settled around her like dust falling through a column of light" advances atmosphere/action); zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts. Rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in taut realization sentences; figurative language purposeful without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dreamless world, wall-memory, and displaced-axis tapestry transforms tropes of lost history into inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via perceptual patience. No derivative echoes; premise commits to eccentric logic without retreat. Bold POV on inanimate listening charges close uniquely.</comment>
