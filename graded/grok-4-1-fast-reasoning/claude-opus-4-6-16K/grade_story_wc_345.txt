<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Collective characterization particularized through Sable's tactile kneeling and bell-ringing, with motivation rooted in shared loss intensifying to communal action; internal conflicts implied but not dramatized in contradictory impulses on-page. Flaws balanced by competence in skills like climbing. Earned endurance in ongoing chalking forecloses isolation with felt kinship cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chalk messages build density to CR closure in "YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of self-reliance over ghostly aid. Orientation anchored early in Verath's blight; one tightening via mineral water discovery narrows dormancy assumption. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain via mineral rain supply, charging final image of weeping stone and green orchards; sensory hierarchy (warm chalk, ringing drops) filtered collectively. Details evolve causally from dust to pulsing fungi. Micro-object (bell) mirrors internal sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (blight survival) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through messages-to-water-to-fruit with collective agency tightening options; cost legible in foreclosed isolation and imperfect "thorny" hope. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of orchestrated kinship emerges from chalk threads and final message reweighting "the dead had started so the living might flourish"; resonant without moralizing, ambiguity in ghost's departure lingers. Particulars (bell, arches) shift meaning organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable collective POV with distinct perceptual signature in nebula-violet glow and brambled imagery; rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical closure. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (read-aloud sings: "crystalline water wept... fat, ringing drops"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative language purposeful in "ribs of some slumbering god." Propulsion peaks in bell's tone carrying hope.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-oracle and sci-fi orchard transforms tropes via chalk mechanics and collective crucible; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, with "arches wept their quiet mineral rain" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
