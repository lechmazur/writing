<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (pride in past vs. confession now) act in scene via secrets spoken to unravel knots; final endurance of partial healing earned by micro-choices with visible cost in steady hands. Interiority concrete and embodied in bone vibration dimming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds knot-by-knot to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "She would not be healed by morning... years of fractures to mend." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism columns and starlight constrain hands (painted knuckles) and charge final image (slowed light, turning stars); net's tactile hush as water/armor mirrors internal shift through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits) signaled early; escalation via knot-deepening reweights unrest under Accumulative lens, agency in confession-for-release forecloses total healing with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of woven silence holding fractures emerges implicitly from net-unraveling and confession; final image ("breathed without trembling... promise she was only beginning to understand") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting hush's power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (hush as "dense and cool, like water pooling"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in knot releases without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; coherent metaphors (silence as "armor, like a cocoon") propel rhythm varying with intensity; peak beats clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spirit-masks and silence-net transforms restoration tropes; risk in reverse-unraveling heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via Tessaly's legacy.</comment>
