<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Adaeze's warmly curious trait drives discoveries through embodied actions like touching roots and asking bones questions; internal conflict between diaspora hollowness and rekindling faith culminates in the earned kola nut offering with broken Igbo speech, revealing hierarchy of values and visible cost of half-anointed fatigue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries build density from sundial pivot to purposeful wandering and rebuilding, delivering Charged Poise closure in the final light-on-symbol and root shift image with felt cost of interrupted personal burial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots weaving bones constrain engineering choices and charge the final breathing roots/fruit-light image; sensory details like cool bark on ribcage and Nsibidi-filtered light reflect Adaeze's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith tightens via deepening pattern recognition of interrupted journeys mirroring her own, forcing renunciation of forgetting through rebuilding; cost legibly felt in "tired of being half-anointed" without resolving fully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys theme emerges organically from bones/roots reroutings to her diaspora arc, reweighted in final green root thread image as non-literal answer to forgetting's burial without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of relearning via feet/roots; rhythmic prose modulates from clinical mapping to enchanted stirring, diction biased toward organic geometry and Nsibidi scripture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm propels from "roots held everything together" to final dappled fruit-light; no loops, coherent metaphors like pale fingers in dark hair integrate without overwriting high-pressure discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora engineer decoding Nsibidi-rooted tomb transforms homecoming trope; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes through organic interruptions pattern paying off in cautious faith reprise.</comment>
