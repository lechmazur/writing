<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Specific profession roots motivation in consistent traits like transliterating foam memories; embodied emotions via "ash-colored tenderness" reveal character under pressure. Earned realization in "cheerful resignation" shows endurance with cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer from seeds/geode to glass-crystal interaction deepening knowledge. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Maren at geode, profession). CR closure in final transliteration ("everything she saved would someday need saving again") reconfigures premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Iridescent geode constrains choices (light fuels glass, crystals bloom roads); selective sensory hierarchy (ozone/honey air, refracted rainbows) reflects Maren's perceptual bias. Final image charges with seeds sinking into floor, mirroring internal states. Body as micro-setting (warming glass) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glass revelations narrowing to emotional sustenance theory. Agency in pressing glass/conjecture forecloses ignorance with cost ("incomplete records better than silence"). Entry 8.8+ via felt price charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-sustained paths emerges organically from transliterations and dissolving seeds; subtext in "laughter shaped like a circle with its center removed" shifts via particulars. Resonant CR ending reweights premise non-literally: relief/sorrow/joy with cyclical saving cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (emotions as color/texture/sound); diction/rhythm modulate discovery ("geode seemed to breathe in rainbows"). Purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "glass warmed... understood now" advances plot/character/emotion); rhythmic variety in read-aloud (short transliteration bursts amid longer builds). Figurative density purposeful/voice-led, no muddle or loops in peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recollectionist art, geode as memory organ, paths folding like unsent letters; risk-taking in lyric fantasy logic inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes.</comment>
