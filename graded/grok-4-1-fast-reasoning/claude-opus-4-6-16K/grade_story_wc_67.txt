<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied contradiction in the preservation mirage versus deliberate scattering; final renunciation of following the ash path earned by ritual's build. Mother's teaching anchors motivation without backstory drag. Micro-choices like powdering reveal values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering ash/ritual toward Charged Poise closure; final image ("persistent beautiful lie") reconfigures options with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchored immediately in gallery/urn/mask. Single scene with chair shard transitions legibly, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gallery's vanishing point constrains ritual and charges closure image; ash particles as micro-setting mirror internal dissolution via "graphite snow" and "dark shimmer." Sensory hierarchy (visual drift, porcelain tactility) POV-specific. Spatial choreography precise, evolving with ash line.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallize absence via scattering) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through powdering/release; final walk away forecloses preservation path with felt cost in "vanish" realization. Agency in endurance/renunciation under pressure. One deepening via mask placement suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete portraits/absence emerges from ash/mask particulars, not statement; final image non-literally answers "fleeting emotion" via reweighted ash line/mirage. Subtext in "safety" illusion layers without moralizing. Resonance from conflicting wants (preserve/release).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with artistic perceptual signature ("graphite snow," "charcoal stroke"); rhythm modulates from deliberate to suspended in peak ash drift. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No POV leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., ash fall advances plot/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent ("tiny mirror" particles), no overwriting in closure beat. Read-aloud ear test passes fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash ritual in vanishing point gallery transforms grief tropes; mask/ash line inevitable in hindsight, risks bold lyric closure without gimmick. Non-obvious angle on preservation via artistic convergence heightens stakes organically.</comment>
