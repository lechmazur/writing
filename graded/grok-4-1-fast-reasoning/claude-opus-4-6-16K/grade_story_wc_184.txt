<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's methodical interiority and micro-choices under the door's impossibility reveal a hierarchy of values, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the rebraiding beat for 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with door-seal-rope causality tightening to RR closure; cost legible in "refusing to let another absence go unnarrated" as seal persists amid vanishing door.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mechanism room, rope, and gears constrain choices (e.g., gloved rebraiding follows irregularities) and charge final image of awakened ticking; sensory hierarchy archivist-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving absence escalates accumulatively via seal's merge cue to rope reconfiguration, foreclosing paradox with felt cost of archiving before crews; agency clear in pivotal rebraiding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fables of absence emerges organically from door-seal-rope events to resonant final image of tower "remembered itself whole," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (e.g., "language she had spent years learning to read") and rhythmic control heighten density; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from "impossible" door to "new voice" closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival absence and mechanical awakening feels inevitable; risk in paradoxical door pays off at rope's "promise kept after six hundred years."</comment>
