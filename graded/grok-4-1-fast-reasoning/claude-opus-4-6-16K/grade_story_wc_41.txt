<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in stiff hands and sternum resonance; precognitively forgetful trait creates contradiction between seeking and inevitable loss, compelling the final hold without tidy epiphany. Micro-choices like chalk-marking reveal values under pressure of dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: driftwood convergence tightens to doorway fog shape, yielding Charged Poise closure where Morrow holds the hum amid foreknowledge of forgetting, cost legible in "He would forget this too, probably" and persisting circle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog garden and driftwood micro-setting constrain search tactics and charge final convergence; sensory hierarchy (sub-audible hum amid waves) narrows with urgency, POV bias filters via prophetic recognition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture aging's sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via markers to on-page hearing and hold; cost felt in resonant endurance amid dissolution, though pressure subtle rather than sharply narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Clinging to echoes emerges organically from chalk circles and dissolving shapes, final image of held hum and remaining circle reweighting premise of futile prophecy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of premonitory fog figures; rhythmic modulation peaks in "fog exhaled... circle remained," diction biased toward tidal echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (driftwood "language legible only to someone who understood longing"); varied rhythm, no loops, metaphors cohere to propel toward closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgetful precog, fog ephemera, and aging's acoustic signature; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable-feeling CR, transforming prophecy trope via specific sensory constraint.</comment>
