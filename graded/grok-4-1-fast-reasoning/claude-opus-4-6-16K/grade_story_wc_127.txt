<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingestion beat embodies contradictory impulses of professional ritual enabling personal fusion; final endurance of dual loneliness earns stasis with irreversible cost, rooting change in prior flaw of insight-without-empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual beats densify to "blotter petal dissolving," delivering resonant reconfiguration; emotional cost legible in weeping-recognition, foreclosing half-truth existence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber walls' static constrains sensing method and pulses with transformation, charging closure image of "ancient witnesses"; micro-setting of resin memory mirrors fusion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to fuse escalates accumulatively via vial-to-blotter deepening; "hit her like weather" crystallization forces agency in endurance, with on-page weeping cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Half-to-whole shift emerges implicitly through vial grief vs. Lida's specificity; final "carried the whole thing now" reweights premise non-literally, embracing impermanence complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature fuses emotion-as-chemistry with amber-memory bias; diction/rhythm ("slow and golden and reluctant") modulates pressure, stable under peak transformation without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Peak "Lida's specific loneliness: the shape of it, the texture" delivers high-density propulsion sans loops; metaphors cohere (honey jar, weather) without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vial-emotions and blotter-resin synthesis transforms counterfeit trope into fresh fusion risk; "affectionate detachment" in final line heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
