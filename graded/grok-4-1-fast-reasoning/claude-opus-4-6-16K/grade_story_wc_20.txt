<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied regret ("luminous regret that filled her chest like lantern glow trapped in glass") and contradictory impulses (love's carelessness vs. release), earning the final formula choice with visible cost of potential permanent loss. Flaws like imposed naming drive her arc organically. No unearned epiphanies; all grounded in micro-choices like repairing the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds from party dispersal to crucible mending to formula completion, tightening via realization of Lior's "cartography." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as CR: speaking formula reconfigures binding with conceptual cost of "shadows have weight," legible in final door-left-open image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain-washed foundry vividly selective (quenched iron smell, soot ribbons, mist congregation), mirroring internal states and constraining choices via tools/crucibles that enable kintsugi and formula. Recurrent crucible charges repair beat and charges final annealing image. Sensory hierarchy alchemical/precise; no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem fracture by releasing name) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening realizations narrowing to formula renunciation. Agency in composing/speaking it forecloses binding path with felt cost of "luminous regret." One tightening suffices; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of naming's weight/kintsugi emerges organically from particulars (crucible repair, coin unbinding), culminating in resonant CR: "the weight of the silence around it" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in images like "gild the consequence"; ambiguity lingers in open door.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (alchemical precision tinting all notice: "factually mystical"). Rhythmic control modulates from percussive rain to gentle wash, heightening regret. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line multi-jobs (e.g., "mist crept... like a congregation" advances atmosphere/transition). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; metaphors coherent (lantern glow regret). Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddle; figurative language purposeful, not overwrought in peak composition beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical naming-bind/zodiac coin/kintsugi transforms trope of parental regret into precise equilibrium act. Risky lyric reflection interleaves actions without flattening; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early fracture image.</comment>
