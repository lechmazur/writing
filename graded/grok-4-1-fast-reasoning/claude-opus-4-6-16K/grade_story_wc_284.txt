<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via scarred hands aching during climb and deciphering, rooting motivation in survival and trust; final choice to vouchsafe to Kaplan earned by recognizing buried courage motif. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in initial skepticism of Dietrich turning to recognition. No safety-hedging; flaws like isolation compound isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from climb to snow archaeology revelation, culminating in CR via memorizing/scattering and mist parting as reconfiguration with erasure cost. Orientation anchored early ("Zephyr Bluff," burned hands backstory cued immediately). Single scene/shard coherent, no ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snow drift and mist constrain pacing/orientation choices, charging final scattering image; body (gloved hands) as micro-setting limits dexterity. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (mineral mist taste amid urgency). Details evolve causally with thaw, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vouchsafe intel) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via grid revelation narrowing to ethical choice of Kaplan; cost legible in scattering evidence foreclosing self-reliance. Agency in deciphering/paces forces stance crystallization. No abstract stakes; betrayal names viscerally test endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation/fixing emerges via snow codes shifting to human trust, resonating in "mist parted" image reweighting isolation to bestowal without moralizing. Subtext in "snow remembers" callbacks charges CR. Complexity in agency betrayal avoids binaries; earned via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (lyric sensory bias: "licking a river stone") stable in close third; rhythmic modulation accelerates in deciphering beat. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful/legible under accumulative lens. Voice embodies spy's prudent caution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "compass rose so fine it caught light" advances plot/atmosphere); varied syntax/paragraphs propel without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (snow "confession," "vertical archaeology") enhance peak revelation. Read-aloud rhythm flawless, no overwriting in closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Snow-sinking codes transform spy dead-drop trope into fresh "vertical archaeology" ingenuity, growing organically from bluff setting. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes via mist opacity. Hindsight inevitability in prudently daring prep reweights betrayal premise.</comment>
