<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in profession as ghostwriter compel the realization; contradictory quest for universal vs. singular threads acts in scene via installation and woman's tears. Final choice to share secret earns change with relational cost. No diagnostic speak; embodied via "secrets... pressed against her ribs."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page CR closure: "the thread... each one was the thread, whole and complete," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of reframed quest. Orientation anchored early in temple/pool; single scene coherent. Persistent installation constraint shapes tactics to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains and charges: lily pond "reflected them both, warped and shimmering," mirrors internal shift; thrush nest spiral tactile via walking/reading. Sensory hierarchy (wet stone, bells) reflects Maren's perceptual bias. Final image recharges pond/temple with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find thread) signaled early, deepens texturally via woman's claim/tears narrowing to singular love realization; agency in installation forces confrontation. Cost legible in reframed understanding foreclosing universal illusion. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of singular threads emerges organically from letters/spiral to final "two strangers holding the same secret"; resonant image reweights particulars without moral. Complexity in whimsical/serious love avoids binaries. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (geometric devotion, prismatic quiet) stable in single POV; dialogue sparse but subtext-rich ("This is mine," forcing breach). Rhythm modulates to hush at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/stakes; varied rhythm (short gust sentences vs. flowing descriptions). Figurative language patterned (spirals, threads, prisms) without muddle or loops. Closure image crystalline: "two strangers holding... like a bowl of rain."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter + thrush nest art + temple reframes love's geometry originally; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to CR without gimmick. Irreplaceable: swap premise and closure fails. Transformation of whimsy/secrecy tropes via specifics.</comment>
