<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction peaks in "bravely conflicted" impulses acting simultaneously as hands move to terminal before mind permits, earning the transmit choice with isolation's visible cost; no stock epiphanies, embodied via breath clouds and frost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens (discovery → mapping networks → blink-decision → transmit) holds with on-page Decisive Change at "pressed transmit," cost legible in ghost letter's release versus preserved original; anchors (who/where/when) by para 2; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via isolation enabling dormant networks and charges final groan/image; "snow pressed against the vaulted ceiling" and echoes mirror internal pressure, selective sensory (groan, hum, frost) through archivist bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disseminate volatile truth) signaled early, causal tightening at blink-transmit forecloses pact obedience with felt cost (complicity visible, breathing easier); agency crystallizes stance under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of affectionate mass murder's human contradiction emerges via letter's "steady, almost tender" penmanship, resonant non-literal answer in ghost-truth climbing atmosphere without moralizing; reweights silence motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (silence as "own weather," "lung of something sleeping") biases noticing; rhythmic diction modulates with intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "echo travel through... cathedral corridors" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak decision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh Antarctic vault premise synthesizes isolation trope with leak-agency, risk in "dormant networks" payoff feels inevitable; bold conceptual integrity on truths' ghost elevates without gimmick.</comment>
