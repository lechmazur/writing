<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels in concrete interiority via tasting memories and micro-choices like pruning under secrecy pressure; final certainty earned through embodied trembling hands and consistent motivation. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in gentle rebellion's risk. No unearned epiphanies; flaws balance competence with isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from tastes/pruning to ripening; closure as Charged Poise in final image ("walked home through streets that did not yet know") reconfigures rebellion with felt conceptual cost of isolation vs. impact. Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via celestial light suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse and celestial light constrain ripening choice and charge final image; sensory tastes (iron, fig, starlight) filter through POV chef's bias. Details tactile and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secret cultivation for rebellion) signaled early, tightens texturally via pruning/light into Charged Poise; agency in harvest/pruning forecloses scattering energy with implied detection risk. One deepening reweights options; cost legible in humble soup plan.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilient knowledge/beauty emerges organically from tastes, fruit, ruins; final lines offer resonant non-literal answer ("beauty was the one language power could never fully outlaw") reweighting Ministry's control without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in memory-tasting; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged poise. No head-hopping or withholding; diction character-specific (culinary precision in pruning).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., pruning evokes memories while advancing plot); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful (violet leaves, indigo deepening). Propulsion peaks in harvest beat without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, chemical knowledge fruit in dystopia transforms tropes; celestial alignment and synaptic hunger premise feels inevitable, risk-taking in quiet rebellion heightens stakes organically.</question>
