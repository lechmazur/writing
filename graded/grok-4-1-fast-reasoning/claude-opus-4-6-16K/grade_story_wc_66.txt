<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as copyist-turned-decoder compels her transcription choice, rooted in concrete skills and "waiting was just silence with better posture." Contradictory impulses between preservation and action act in-scene via tuning the dial. Final renunciation of waiting lands with earned cost in the hidden pocket, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from backstory to song capture to folding builds to CR closure in "silence felt different now—thistled, calm, pricked with small thorns." Orientation anchored early in alcove. Cost legible in "thorns of meaning that would work their way into the skin," with persistent risk of detection shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, ink iron smell constrain secrecy and charge final image, mirroring internal shift from dust to "dust was already listening." Sensory hierarchy via copyist's ear (oboe register) biases details. 9+ test met: recurring embers/mist evolve to tension silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/smuggle vs. silence) signaled early; textural deepening in song arrival/transcription narrows to smuggling choice with implicit detection cost. Agency in "pen touched paper" and folding forecloses waiting. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, entering 8+ via trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of stories reviving dust/silence emerges via particulars like encoded lullabies; final CR "dust was already listening" reweights premise non-literally with regime cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in "thorns" lingers. 9+ test: resonant answer to story famine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature ("oboe's chalumeau register") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from calm setup to pulsed transcription. No head-hopping; elision of network taught early, paid in whispers. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short "She wrote quickly" amid longs), no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful (mist "like milk poured into a bowl"). Propulsion peaks in song beat without overwriting. 9+ test: zero issues, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pirate songs encoding erased histories transforms dystopia via copyist's lens; "teach dust to tell stories" fresh synthesis risks lyric stasis resolved in pricked silence. No template echoes; hindsight inevitability in dust CR.</comment>
