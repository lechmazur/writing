<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("snagged in Luma's chest like a fishhook"); micro-choices under pressure culminate in projection revealing values; final endurance of quiet joy earned with prior causal search.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stumble to vision to projection; CR closure in "It wouldn't last" reconfigures joy with legible conceptual cost of temporariness; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fog as recurring micro-setting scatters light, constraining and enhancing projection; charges final image of "fog weaving between the projected blossoms"; sensory hierarchy (taste fog, light droplets) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early, deepens via daydream vision into agency-driven projection under Accum lens; one tightening forecloses hoarding path with on-page cost of ephemerality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared, light-exposed joy emerges organically from fresco-projection arc; final image offers resonant CR repricing without moral; no overt statements, ambiguity in quiet return lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with light-obsessed perceptual signature ("walls were sensitive surfaces waiting to be struck"); rhythmic modulation peaks in projection; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel from fog entry to glowing orchard; zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (fog as "milk in a bowl," light "floating in the air").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting, fog orchard, phosphorescent murals transforms artist-block trope; risk in temporary creation heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
