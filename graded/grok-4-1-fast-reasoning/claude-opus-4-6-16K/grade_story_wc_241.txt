<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the hospital scene where father's "you're gambling" elicits her flinch and responsible retort, earning the final halfway commitment with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern-building shards (scrawls to maps to visits), culminating in Charged Poise closure via lantern-lit writing that reweights caution with undeniable partiality cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lantern's mica pane as micro-setting constrains and charges the final writing beat, mirroring partial illumination; rain and library details selectively filter through Elena's probabilistic bias without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of responsible widening tightens accumulatively via hospital spike ("monitor spike, which made her flinch"), forcing trade-off in halfway agency with legible emotional price charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of annotated maps under lantern offers non-literal resonant answer to lucid contradictions, reweighting premise through particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (patterns/probabilities) and rhythmic modulation sustain single POV under reflective pressure; no head-hopping, voice coheres as probabilistic lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels shards; purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "clover melancholy") without muddle or loops enhances closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scrawls-as-curriculum transforms grief/growth tropes into fresh probabilistic mosaic; risk of reflective shards heightens stakes via irreplaceable city-traversal synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
