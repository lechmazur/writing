<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's envy of the locust shell's "broken free" ignites shift from soft playing to revolutionary waltz; contradictory caution (reads statue rhythms) and boldness act simultaneously, earning closure's grief-tarnished wonder with burned fingers' cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as music density breaks ordered pattern into wild dance/uprooting; Charged Poise closure via living locust on "branch that should not have existed" makes before/after legible with years-lost grief cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Granite feet "grinding furrows" and crystal-heart pulse constrain her frequency play; swaying sky-bridge and tangled roots in final image charge reconfiguration of captivity to freedom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to reawaken beauty tightens via deepened note forcing statues' falter/dance; agency in weaving waltz escalates to uprooting with fingers-burned and grief prices unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shell's crumble to luminous locust reweights order-vs-beauty premise; final "grief and wonder...grew from the same root" offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Musical perceptual signature ("resonantly soft," "bow," "final chord") biases noticing; syntax rhythm modulates from floating notes to groaning bark without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("roots...pushing upward through the manicured soil"); varied rhythm propels statue-dance beat to closure without loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Playable crystal hearts transform guardian statues into mossy trees; synthesis of music-order-freedom feels inevitable from shell's "exact shape of life, holding nothing but air."</comment>
