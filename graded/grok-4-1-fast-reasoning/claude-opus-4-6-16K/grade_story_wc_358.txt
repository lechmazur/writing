<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to map wind patterns roots deeply in grief and brother's patch, embodied in tactile touches; interiority concrete without epiphanies. Internal drive shows via adapting methods under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensor placements build density to CR closure in final crossroads image, reweighting foresight premise with conceptual cost of transforming grief; orientation anchors early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Container labyrinth as wind instrument constrains choices (new corridor funnel) and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (salt, diesel gusts) filters through Maren's cartographer lens, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of foresight tightens via anemometer spikes and southeast funnel discovery, narrowing options with felt risk to crews; agency in grid-mapping shows one deepening under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of convergence emerges from particulars like wind channels and patch, resonant CR in "labyrinth would speak"; ambiguity in predictability lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (wind as architectural); rhythmic control modulates from lazy spin to tangled forces, heightening density without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and sensory integration; "singular convergence" purposeful repetition charges closure without loops, but minor register elevation in "luminous data" edges from port grit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of containers as wind instrument transforms grief into system; risk in treating port as score pays off inevitably in map's foresight, no derivative echoes.</comment>
