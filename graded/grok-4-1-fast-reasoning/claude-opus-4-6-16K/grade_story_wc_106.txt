<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between visual photography and auditory destiny peak in the jar-listening beat, earning the camera-bag renunciation with embodied cost; interiority particular via light obsession, no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as light density builds to CR closure when "she understood... never been stealing moments. She had been transcribing them," reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emerald marble and light shift constrain timeframe choice (crouching to crossing) and charge closure image of "moonlight... steady, generous"; sensory hierarchy (visual narrowing to inner hum) mirrors revelation perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hear destiny via jar) tightens via sunset-to-moonlight cadence shift, forcing eye-closure agency that forecloses visual path with legible cost in bag abandonment; pressure coheres texturally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of light-as-transcendence reweights via hum's "vast, luminous composition," offering non-literal answer to visual-chasing premise without moralizing; resonance from particulars like photographed faces as frequencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (light as "fractured emerald fire," "swimming light") biases noticing distinctively; stable close-third POV with rhythmic control modulates from urgent observation to poised stasis; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (light as "sacred," hum as "chord") without muddle, propelling via varied rhythm to peak in "disbelief so bright it felt like standing inside the sun."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of portrait-thievery, flower codes, and moonbeam jar transforms trope of epiphany into auditory score revelation; risk of quiet lyric closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
