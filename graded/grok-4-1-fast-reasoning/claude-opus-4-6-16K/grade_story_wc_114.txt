<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Embodied guilt as evolving "stone" and deliberate ink-smudging micro-choice under pressure reveal contradictory impulses; final margin-writing renunciation earned by prior fault-tolerance flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density (ink bleed, pressure traces) to Conceptual Repricing closure in "I saw it. I said nothing."; cost legible as open-carried truth foreclosing denial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Botanical illustration as recurring micro-setting constrains realization when thumb-smudged, bleeding to charge final image; auroral light filters POV priorities purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of swallowed-truth weight deepens accumulatively when ink-smudging forces stance crystallization; legible cost in daylight-carrying reweights internal options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ink bleed across saxifrage reconfigures swaying-certainties premise non-literally, resonating prior meteorological images without moralizing; complexity lingers in unresolved weather-system truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via barometric/mood readings; rhythmic modulation (slow rise to charged poise) stable in close third without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with coherent metaphors ("certainties sway like compass near iron," ink "bleeding outward"); varied rhythm propels reflective beats without loops or overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological fault-tolerance as oracle-guilt crucible transforms certainty tropes; margin-confession turn inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
