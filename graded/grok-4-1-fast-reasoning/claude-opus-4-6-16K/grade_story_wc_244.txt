<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shift from elusive bulk-care to personal reciprocity earned via moon rock's dare forcing her uncharacteristic letter; contradictory impulses embodied in "desperately jocular deflections" constrain initial resistance before yielding to micro-choices like sending puns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moon rock letter catalyzes density increase from notes to gifts/visits, landing Charged Poise CR closure ("ivy held the station, tendril by tendril") with legible reconfiguration cost of ending isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-overgrown station as micro-setting constrains communal openness and charges final cradling image; selective details like pigeons/departures board filter through logistician POV, evolving with gifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness vs. reciprocal binding) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via letter catalyzing exchanges/visits that foreclose hiding with felt relational cost; one deepening suffices, agency in replies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity-as-cure emerges organically from accumulating gifts; final moon rock on sill offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration reweighting isolation premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with logistician perceptual signature (inventorying notes/gifts); rhythmic modulation builds reflective texture to charged closure without elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., short punchy laughs amid reflection); zero loops, coherent metaphors (ivy/moon rock), no overwriting in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moon rock as cosmic dare infuses fresh ingenuity into reciprocity trope, synthesizing logistician isolation with absurd gift-web for inevitable quiet transformation.</comment>
