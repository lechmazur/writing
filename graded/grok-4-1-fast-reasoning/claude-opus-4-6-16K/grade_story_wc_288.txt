<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied grief (e.g., "pressed her face into the velvet neck") earn the shift to independence; minor diagnostic phrasing like "isolation said... independence answered" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via memories culminating in Charged Poise closure; cost legible when she "did not move the texts," foreclosing routine safety with vulnerability to mist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal surges and stone circle hum constrain routine (fragile texts moved preemptively) and charge final image (mist curling around ankles and sundial reflection); POV-filtered sensory hierarchy sharpens awakening fractures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. independence) tightens accumulatively through memory density to renunciation; cost felt in embracing "stationed" endurance over protective isolation at tide's rise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-preserved coexistence emerges organically from vaelkross grief to final self-library image; resonant non-literal answer reweights extinction's warmth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (library "breathes," hum "through her bones") with rhythmic modulation; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged ending poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or muddle; metaphors like "ice fracturing across a lake" integrate purposefully, heightening brittle awakenings without overwriting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation witness in tidal archive transforms extinction trope; bold lyric risk (refractive memories to mist embrace) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
