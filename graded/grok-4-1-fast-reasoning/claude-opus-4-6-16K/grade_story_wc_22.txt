<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation roots deeply in past promise, embodied in concrete actions like crushing seeds and murmuring Sumerian, with endurance as earned stasis. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously; serenity lacks micro-choice friction under subtle pressure. Final renunciation of needing to see completion carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of rituals and backstory builds to Charged Poise closure in final image of swaying flowers and mares departing, reconfiguring reclamation with conceptual cost of incompleteness. Orientation anchors early ("jetty at Gloom Hill"); one shard transition legible. Cost legible in "He did not need to."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains choices (crevices for seeds, tidal spray for moisture) and charges final image ("flowers swayed... growing over the bones"). Sensory details selective via bird calls and POV bias (linguist notices ancient echoes). Atmosphere's "narrow vastness" tensions infinite horizon with intimate ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclamation post-reef death) deepens texturally via layered methods, narrowing to endurance with cost in "did not know if he would live to see." Agency in daily planting; no live antagonist but environmental opposition coheres. One tightening via bird-directed planting alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of correspondence between destructions emerges organically from garden as letter to battlefield, resonating in final reef-skeleton image without moralizing. Subtext in "submerged concord" reweights loss as substrate for new life. Complexity in ambiguous renewal avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (dead languages, bird translation); rhythmic prose modulates serenely ("seven-note whistle descending"). No dialogue; compression purposeful, eliding passengers to charge isolation. Voice distinct, biased toward renewal patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm suits ritual pace, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("vastness compressed into slivers") purposeful for tone but risks coherence in peak twilight beat. Closure image crisp, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguist-coachman-gardener transforms post-ecological ruin trope via dead languages and bird method. Risk in serene stasis heightens reclamation stakes organically. No derivative echoes; particulars like salt roses feel inevitable.</comment>
