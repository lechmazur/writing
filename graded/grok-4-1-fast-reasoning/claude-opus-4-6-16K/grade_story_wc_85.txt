<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction and embodied guilt culminate in earned resolve at "She would go to Petra first," with prior sifting micro-choices revealing value hierarchy; no unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure; carving discovery as pattern break reconfigures options with legible emotional cost in pocket image and descent; orientation anchored by para 1, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood whale and terrace tiles constrain discovery choice and charge final pocket/ribs image; sensory hush filters perception purposefully, mirroring internal sifting without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant guilt stake tightens accumulatively via carving match, forcing confession trade-off; cost felt in "second heartbeat" press and foreclosed silence path, though internal focus slightly mutes visceral scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Forgery-to-truth arc emerges organically from sifting particulars, resonant non-literal answer in whale's "pointing... toward a time that demands to be acknowledged" reweighting withheld truth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases to indigo light and sieved silence; rhythmic modulation peaks at discovery with purposeful compression, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative layering ("guilt became architecture; it built rooms") borders overwrite in reflective beats, slightly dulling peak propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Black-market genealogist synthesizing driftwood provenance and withheld truth offers fresh inflection on inheritance tropes; whale/watch-hand synthesis feels inevitable, risk-taking in lyric resolve heightens stakes.</comment>
