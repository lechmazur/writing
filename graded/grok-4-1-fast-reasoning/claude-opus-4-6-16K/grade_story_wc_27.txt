<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via bare feet sensing vibrations and rituals revealing contradictory impulses toward isolation versus outreach; final transmission choice earned by escalating resonance, foreclosing doubt with felt cost of uncertainty. Awkward confidence shown through "clumsy earnestness," driving micro-choices without label-speak. Minor reflection tilt stays anchored to present hum, tilting stance effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stalled rebellion to stone hum as pattern break, culminating in Charged Poise closure via transmission that reconfigures lull into potential. Cost legible in "She did not know who would hear it," with coordinates riding ancient frequency. Orientation anchored early (Maren in repair bay, post-shuttle era); single scene coherent, no ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful—bare feet on "cold deck plating" and rivets, ozone smell—constrain choices (hum felt somatically first) and charge final image of gantry perch. POV bias filters via stargazer's priorities; setting evolves with descending sun and glowing stones mirroring internal shift. Micro-setting (scaffolding, jammed roof) guides observation without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite stalled rebellion) signaled early, escalates via hum's deepening that narrows options from silence to broadcast under Accumulative lens. Agency in pulling transmitter and transmitting forecloses inertia with cost of exposure into "indifferent dark." One tightening sufficient; moral calculus between doubt and action viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in transmission emerges organically from barefoot rituals and stone resonance, reweighting rebellion lull via final broadcast image without moralizing. Subtext in "universe that owed her nothing" yields to "act of transmitting"; epiphany earned through hum's "thunderous serenity." Lingering ambiguity ("did not know if it mattered") embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable with perceptual signature in tactile, star-mapping bias; voice modulates rhythm from observational poise to resonant surge, syntax reflecting stargazer's mind. No dialogue, but internal texture distinct and pressured. Purposeful lyric compression taught early in rituals, paid off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "barefoot across the cold deck plating, her soles blackened" advances setting, character, atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in hum description purposeful and coherent, not muddling peak. Final line recharges motifs with image propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi rebellion with prehistoric stone hum and personal opera-glass ritual transforms tropes into inevitable barefoot transmission. Risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via ancient frequency evading jammers. Non-obvious moral calculus on meaning-making feels authentic and particularized.</comment>
