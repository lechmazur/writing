<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "not an adventurer" yet diving anyway, rooted in stubborn trait; final lens placement earns closure choice with embodied steadiness despite cold, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density from package to lens repair; CR closure reconfigures city's "need" with legible cost in her vanishing ache ("for the first time in years... gone"), orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Diving suit wheeze and coral-books constrain dive and charge library as micro-setting; rooftop visibility and impossible tower mirror internal ache purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (answer persistent call) signaled early, tightens via lighthouse discovery narrowing to burial act; agency in shard placement forecloses signals with paradox cost felt in warmer water and her relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Paradox of "revitalized... by letting it die" emerges organically from burial motif shifting to city scale; final exhale image resonates as non-literal answer to unrest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature biases toward light/ache (palms itch, signals in graves); rhythmic control modulates from quiet stubbornness to charged release, stable third-limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "light... turned inward" packs closure); no loops, varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful figures like "coral-like masses" integrate without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker mythos with drowned library beacon transforms tropes; impossible tower risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via signals priming repair.</comment>
