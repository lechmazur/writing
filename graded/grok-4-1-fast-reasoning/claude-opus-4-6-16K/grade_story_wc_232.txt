<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Empirically intuitive trait drives pattern-spotting (maps overlay, ants), earning final choice among orchids with visible cost of deferred life; contradictory impulses act when she almost turns back before ants appear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify (maps converge, ants lead, chip fits) to CR closure where glimmer reveals choice clarity with felt cost of loneliness reweighted; orientation anchored early in shop backstory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blooming cavern constrains (imperceptible draft, rising creek forces overnight wait) and charges final image (sat among ghost orchids); sensory selectivity (bioluminescent scripts, cicada hum) reflects empirical POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise) signaled early tightens accumulatively via creek wade and ant-follow to deepening at chip-click, forcing stance crystallization with opportunity cost legible in deferred life vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of promise as self-clarity emerges organically from map spirals to glimmer vision reweighting habits; final orchid image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (empirical details like vellum crumble, ant columns); rhythmic control modulates from shop isolation to cavern poise without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image (chip "slid into the niche with a click that resonated"); varied rhythm breathes with scene urgency, zero loops, precise diction like "limestone country south of the Elk River."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Matrix chip as doorway glyph transforms quest trope into internal CR; ants-home method and empirical intuition synthesize fresh inevitability to closure without derivative echoes.</comment>
