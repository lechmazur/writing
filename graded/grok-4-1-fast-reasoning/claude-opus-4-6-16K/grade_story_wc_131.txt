<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between habitual hiding and urge to reveal act simultaneously through object arrangement and letter, earning the final visible wait with exposure cost. Interiority concrete via smell-triggered memory tying grandmother's voice to her preservation drive. Single-POV excellence with no safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and object placements build to Charged Poise closure: "Maren folded herself into the worn leather chair... did not hide," with legibly felt vulnerability cost after 11 months. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (crawl space, library, pre-dawn). Single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library's hidden anatomy (pipe chases, ducts) constrains Maren's life and enables object discovery, charging final image where tape "gleamed... like a small dark jewel." Sensory hierarchy (iron oxide smell narrowing to memory) reflects her priorities. "Sapphire hush" recurs purposefully without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end invisibility) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through object research/placement forcing renunciation of hiding with exposure cost. Agency in methodical arrangement narrows options to vulnerable wait. One tightening via letter suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Preserving voices via sense memory emerges implicitly from tape triggering grandmother's ethos, reweighting invisibility premise in final image without moralizing. Complexity in inheritance amid loss avoids tidy epiphany. Resonance from particulars like "smelled iron oxide, flour."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in sensory biases (mineral scents unlocking memory). Rhythmic control modulates from hush to steadying lights. No POV slips; purposeful compression of backstory anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., tape description advances character, theme, closure). Varied syntax/paragraphs propel accumulatively; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. "Cathedral of shadows" opens with ear-tested rhythm charging library's dual nature.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of homeless trope via library's "hidden anatomy" as both shelter and archive, transforming objects into bridge to visibility. Quiet Charged Poise ending risks bold lyricism that heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
