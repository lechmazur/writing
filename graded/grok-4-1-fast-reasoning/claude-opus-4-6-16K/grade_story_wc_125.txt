<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's poetic interiority and micro-choices with the rope reveal contradictory impulses toward knowledge versus lived texture, earning the closure choice; her roadside poet traits constrain and propel the renunciation without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building density of rope examination and celestial images to Charged Poise/CR closure; cost legible in "I'll keep the braid" line, forgoing omniscience for fraying life with persistent rope constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto, spiraling stars, and rope as micro-setting constrain reflective choice and charge final image where starlight glows on walls during writing; sensory selection (tactile fibers, humming light) filters through Maren's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of impossible choice signaled early escalates accumulatively via deepening rope layers paralleling time, narrowing to textural trade-off; agency in renunciation forecloses omniscience path with felt cost in final chest-clutching image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of textured time versus smooth omniscience emerges organically from rope braids and prisoner parallel, answered non-literally by final "keep the braid" that reweights prior unraveling motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (sacred in ditch, starlight tasting) modulates rhythm under reflection pressure; voice texture in syntax reflects Maren's mind, eliding backstory seamlessly into present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels via integrated images like "hemp fibers splitting like nervous endings"; metaphors cohere around weaving without muddle in peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of energy beings' koan-like offer and prison rope transforms escape trope into time-texture metaphor; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure stakes via non-obvious braid renunciation.</comment>
