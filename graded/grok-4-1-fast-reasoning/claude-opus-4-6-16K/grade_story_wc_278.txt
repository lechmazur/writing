<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior conflict embodied in firmware's haunt echoing abandonment guilt; final micro-choice pressing amber reveals values hierarchy with cost, earned by letters' accumulation. Contradictory impulses (destroy vs. confront) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from phantom cries to responsive messages via letters, yielding Charged Poise closure in "I know" with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored early in lab.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lab jars and cylinders constrain via breathing silence amid guilt; amber/firmware as micro-settings charge final image, filtering through Maren's sound-obsessed POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt via cry translation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as messages evolve with letters; agency in reading/press costs prior isolation, charging ending image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Guilt/silence theme emerges from firmware ghosts and amber's "trapped time," reweighted non-literally in final hush and letter-writing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sound-biased perceptual signature ("spectral wails like steam") modulates rhythmically; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful (meteor hush recurs to charge closure), propels via image integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted tech and lost sounds transforms guilt trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via amber-firmware press.</comment>
