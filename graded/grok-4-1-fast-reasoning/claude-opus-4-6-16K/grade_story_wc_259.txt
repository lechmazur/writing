<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied emotions like "joy so pure it was anguished" and micro-choices in random sampling reveal contradictory impulses (duty vs. transformation); final change earned by accumulation with cost of lost loyalty legible in "never again be the historian the Order had trained her to be."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as inhaled fragments build interior map to CR closure; cost undeniable in transformative realization "It was love...outlasting every civilization"; orientation anchored early in pagoda/archival descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (vapor as "gold thread," lantern guttering) filtered through historian's priorities constrain choices (randomness evades wards); pagoda recurs to charge final dawn image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden pursuit without detection) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density of 47 ampules forcing stance crystallization; agency in chaotic method yields felt cost of eroded loyalty, though internalization limits visceral tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformative memory-as-love emerges organically from particulars (ampule inhalations, randomness sanctifying chaos); final CR reweights premise without moralizing—"It was love, residual and radiant"—resonating with prior atoms of nostalgia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "atoms of nostalgia"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, perceptual bias shapes noticing (wards invisible to chaos); no head-hopping, voice coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm (short lantern-gutter sentences amid lyric swells); minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("fingers of a ghost reaching") during opener slightly dulls early momentum, but closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystallized emotions and chaotic historiography transforms forbidden-knowledge trope; "atoms of nostalgia" premise feels inevitable, risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes toward radiant CR without gimmickry.</comment>
