<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously ("logically emotional," diagrams waves yet hums to protect); final endurance earned by her obsessive maintenance and grief experience, with Torvald's mask cracking as relational cost. Interiority concrete and embodied (key "bite through fabric into skin"). No safety-hedging; flaws like precision obsession drive protection over logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: intercept transmission → descend → confront → hum destroys collar → Bell rings with Torvald's grief exposed as RR/Charged Poise. Closure on-page cost legible ("His eyes were wet"; administrative mask cracks). Orientation anchored early (Dock Seven, lighthouse engineer); single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bell/ossuary constrains choices (patina precision alters voice; palm against bronze triggers resonance) and charges final image. Sensory vivid/POV-filtered (groaning marina, verdigris maintenance, tonal architecture). Atmosphere tensions progress vs sacred (fleeting sunset races ice).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Bell vs silence) signaled early, tightens causally via humming reversal narrowing Torvald's options. Agency in adaptation forecloses silencing with felt cost (collar vibrates apart; Torvald's grief released). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; moral calculus (logic vs absolution) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (protect by becoming the song; logic yields to vibrational grief release) emerges from particulars, reweights premise in final image without statement. Resonant non-literal answer: "You became part of its song" recharges prior maintenance/grief. Complexity lingers (Torvald affected yet order signed); no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with engineer perceptual signature (frequencies, overtones, patina millimeters). Prose rhythmic/distinct (short urgent sentences in descent; elongates in hum build). Dialogue subtextual/natural ("You can't stop this" vs silent hum); voices distinct idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density/propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "The sound built. It moved through the floor... until the foam vibrated apart"). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (ice "groaned like a living thing," tone "fleshly and ethereal"). Zero scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sonic grief-absolution Bell + engineer-as-human-resonator transforms lighthouse trope. Risk in vibrational physics internalized via character choice; inevitable hindsight (15 years learning overtones enables climax). Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
