<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's decisive kindness compels the dulcimer song and clear phone call without hesitation, earning Harold's emotional opening; contradictory impulses in Harold surface simultaneously in weeping then whispering "Call June," with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ordinary details densify into song-litany → pattern break with phone call → RR closure in record pieces nearly mended; cost legible in "the broken pieces are held close enough to remember the song."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Altitude setting constrains sound ("a single struck note could hang... like company") and charges final corridor image; white-gold light and clouds filter through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of flawless goodbye signaled early, tightens accumulatively via song's density forcing relational opening; agency in Elara's hymning forecloses estrangement path with Harold's laughter and death as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mundane-as-sacred emerges implicitly from cereal/mail routes song to record's near-whole; final image non-literally answers breakage with "held close enough to remember the song," reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elara POV with perceptual signature in scent/image bias ("clouds pressed... like curious animals"); minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven in Elara's clear call to June.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in song beat propel emotionally); no loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors like "grooves still holding the ghost" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hymning mundane transforms hospice trope via specific mail/cereal details into forgiveness frequency; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in record image, feeling inevitable.</comment>
