<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation roots deeply in ambiguous loss, shown through concrete micro-choices like tracing the mosaic and placing the eyes, embodying contradictory grief/hope without diagnostic labels. Interiority particularizes her mathematical lens on emotion, with flaws (stubborn refusal to resolve) complicating endurance. Final shift in formula earns closure via prior causality, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tending orchard to spell hum and asymptotic realization (CR), reweighting stake with iterative cost legible in "one decimal place closer." Orientation anchors early (cavern, moonlight); single scene coherent. No orientation debt; cost proof in final formula shift and search resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cavern orchard (stalactites dripping, luminous fruit, moonlight column) constrains conjuring (secrecy by feel, hum resonance) and charges closure image of trees "growing toward a light that came and went." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (mathematical read of gaps); details evolve with ritual. Satisfies 9+ test via setting-shaped final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve loss via emotion-math) signaled early, tightens via spell's iteration under Accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance with felt cost in endless approximation. Agency in ritual choices forecloses full resolution. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral price, but charges poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of iterative loss emerges organically from mosaic gaps, eyes, and asymptote insight, with final image ("trees went on growing") offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting math-emotion premise. Subtext in silence and glow avoids moralizing. Satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (math proofs, conjurer's feel); diction/rhythm modulate to hum's intensity without filter excess. Voice distinct, prose reflects Maren's mind (e.g., "architecture of her skull"). No dialogue; 9+ test met with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short hum sentence amid long ritual build); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—eyes as "planets orbiting nothing" coherent. Propulsion peaks in spell glow without overwriting. 9+ test: zero artifacts, clear under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes, mosaic animal code, cavern orchard, and emotion-as-asymptote transforms loss trope into inevitable math-ritual arc. Risk in lyric conjuring pays off at closure without gimmick. 9+ test: non-obvious inevitability heightens stakes.</comment>
