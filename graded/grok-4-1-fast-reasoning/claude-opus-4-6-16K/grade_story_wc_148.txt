<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in nightly tracing and confessing despite disbelief; endurance of carving as testimony earned by heritage flaw and "hovers between despair and something almost like repose." Flaw complicates without hedging; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of rituals builds to Charged Poise closure in final carving image; cost legible in "before they find the bodies, he must finish his labyrinth," foreclosing denial amid shifting tides. Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via winter storms anticipation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse walls constrain confession and carving, charging final "copperlight holds him"; recurring copperlight and scuffs mirror internal state through tactile action. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: light floods like cathedral, wind denies hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belief via labyrinth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to endurance renunciation of silence; cost unmistakable in ongoing isolation but poised tides shift. Agency in persistent carving forecloses easy despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of patient dead and breathing lighthouse offers resonant answer to unbelieved truth without moral; "chasing hush" emerges organically from failed confessions, reweighting liar's legacy through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scuff-reading "like a blind man" and lighthouse "breathing"; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without head-hopping or elision. Voice reflects trapped persistence seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density with propulsion via image layering like "diamonds into a hundred small suns." Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no figurative muddle in peak repose beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scuff-tracing as braille labyrinth transforms prison trope into fresh testimony method; cry-wolf literalism and confessional lattice synthesize non-obviously, risking lyric stasis that heightens stakes inevitability.</comment>
