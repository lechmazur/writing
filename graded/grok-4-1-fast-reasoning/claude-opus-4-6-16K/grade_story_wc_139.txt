<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in Mara's sickness at father's brilliance and drive for fair math, earning father's "Okay" with relational cost; micro-choices like calling consulate reveal values hierarchy. Interiority concrete via chess/math metaphors particular to her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mara's verification therefore threat therefore DC at "Okay" with exposure cost legible in "If I do this, I'm exposed." Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prep room's smells, humming lights, embalming table as "altar" constrain via honesty pressure mirroring stakes; ink pot as recurring micro-setting charges father's cradle at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (force real asylum) signaled early, tightens via Mara's threat narrowing options; agency in active wait forces trade-off, exposure cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fair trade theme emerges from ink pot shift (honest object enables balance) and final image reweights con disease without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in math balancing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Mara-limited POV with perceptual signature (chess positions, math equations); dialogue subtext-heavy, goal-driven ("You know"), distinct voices via reflex smile vs cold recognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short punchy dialogue beats vs flowing interior); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (scaffolding, fracture lines) even in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con redemption via daughter's asylum pivot and funeral/ink pot frame transforms tropes; risk in quiet DC heightens stakes organically.</comment>
