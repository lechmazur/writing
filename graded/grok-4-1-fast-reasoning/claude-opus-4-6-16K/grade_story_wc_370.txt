<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied empathy (pain as "frequency"); contradictory impulses in crumpling yet entering compel earned change at "did not run," confronting flaw without safety-hedging. Minor therapy-speak in realization ("compassionate letting go") borders diagnostic but doesn't flatten closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via paradox density to CR closure ("leaving and staying were opposites... nestled"); invitation/book causality anchors progression with legible cost in reconfiguration ("did not need to hide"). Orientation clear early; single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via hidden corridor/book ("STAYING WHILE LEAVING") charging final image (bells, rain); selective sensory hierarchy (cathedral quiet, trembling halos) mirrors internal states purposefully. No white-room; evolved with midnight exhale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth mistake wisdom) tightens accumulatively to deepening realization narrowing options (hiding foreclosed); agency in staying with Librarian's loneliness shows cost. Minor abstractness in stake declaration vs. visceral payoff holds from 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from paradox particulars (shelf labels, mother's entry) to resonant CR ("paradoxes that only compassion could hold"); non-literal final image reweights premise without moralizing. Earned ambiguity in "leave gently" lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (empathic absorption); lyrical rhythm modulates to charged poise at midnight bells. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You came to understand a mistake"); no filter stacks or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short bells vs. breathing silence); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors ("tranquility wider than the walls"). Propulsion peaks cleanly in realization without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms recluse trope via paradox library/ouroboros inheritance; risk in quiet CR heightens emotional specificity without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from creases "like small rivers... leading exactly here."</comment>
