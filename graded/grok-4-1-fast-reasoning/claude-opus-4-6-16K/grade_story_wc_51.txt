<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation to quantify grief is concrete and consistent, shown through precise loom adjustments mirroring visitor postures. Interiority particular via fractal reverie, embodied in tilting the loom three degrees for tidal grief. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene, reducing to endurance without micro-choice tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setting to process to woman’s burden calcification, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "the pattern demanded completion and the pattern could never be complete." Closure cost legible in eternal incompletion of fractals mirroring grief. Orientation anchored immediately in grotto and snowmelt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze grotto walls veined with verdigris constrain the boundary-less trap, charging the final starlit image. Sensory hierarchy selective: copper-bright streams, shingled hush, lamp pulse reflect weaver’s priorities. Micro-setting (loom, bowl) guides calcification choice, evolving with each stone’s clink.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of structuring sorrow via burdens signaled early, deepens accumulatively through woman’s sternum-listed grief and stone extraction. One tightening in precise threading narrows to her incompletion cost. Pressure coheres texturally but lacks agency-driven reversal under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of suffering’s recursive architecture emerges organically from weaving iterations and stones, reweighted in final fractal/grief equivalence. Subtext in silence shingling and woman’s unhealed exhale invites ambiguity without moralizing. Closing image offers non-literal resonance on structure within formlessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in fractal/geometric noticing (e.g., "angle that mirrored the woman's grief"). Voice texture distinct in rhythmic, layered syntax matching shingled hush. No dialogue; compression purposeful and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., lamp warms silence and pulses hush); rhythm varies read-aloud, accelerating in calcification beat. Figurative coherent and pattern-taught (recursive spirals, shingled silence), no muddle or loops. Minor density elevation in opening descriptions doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal math quantifying grief into mineral stones transforms myth into precise reverie. Bold conceit of boundary-less trap via unfinished pattern risks poetic excess but heightens stakes inevitably. No derivative echoes; particulars like verdigris lamp ground ingenuity.</comment>
