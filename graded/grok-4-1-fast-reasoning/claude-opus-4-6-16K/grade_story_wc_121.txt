<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between floating defiance and grounded longing act in visions of alternate selves; final fall earned by timeline fractures, with cost of internalized eternity palpable in body-labyrinth fusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building timeline density to drop-ripple interval; CR closure reconfigures fractures into continuous self on-page, cost legible in rune dissolution and blank tablet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent viaduct and canal constrain suspension-to-fall trajectory, charging dimmed final glow as micro-setting mirroring internal integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-conquest signaled early, deepens via embodied visions narrowing to acceptance; agency in rune-press and fall drives escalation, plunge cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fractured acceptance emerges from timeline shards to vein-rib integration, final ripple disappearance reweighting premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of threads/mirrors/labyrinths; diction rhythm modulates to propel fall, perceptual bias character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and integrated metaphors like "darkening brightness"; zero loops, propulsion peaks flawlessly in plunge without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious procedural tablet synthesis transforms gravity trope into self-labyrinth, poetic risk heightens stakes inevitability in grounded closure.</comment>
