<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in refusal to leave despite invitations, embodied in tending gardens while knowing survival ≠ revival; final renunciation of miracles earned by bottle-amplified memory, with cost of isolation felt on ridge overlook.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed openings to resonance at "pressed it to her temple," cadence shifts to luminous suspension by dawn; closure as Charged Poise/CR in "began," reconfiguring loss to agency with conceptual cost of "harder, slower, truer" legible in final descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurrent lanterns and cove constrain choices (creak overhead cueing instrument insight, bioluminescent plans as adaptation); ridge overlook charges final image, mirroring internal archive; sensory hierarchy alchemical (salt-bleached paper, geothermal channels).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bottle resonance narrowing to memory-held blueprints; agency in walking streets forecloses escape with felt cost of solitude, though internal pressure dominates over external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining from "genuinely old bones" emerges via particulars (chalked well to pulsing bottle); final image non-literally answers false comfort vs. true work, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (alchemical compression: "working memory held it all in luminous suspension"); rhythmic control modulates from static dawn to charged descent, diction biased to tidal formulas and crystals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "ghost town settled around her like dust on a mantle" advances isolation and resolve); zero loops, varied syntax propels to closure image untouched by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal alchemy archive in sealed bottle transforms ghost-town trope; risk of lyric memory-build to Charged Poise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from failed wish-well.</comment>
