<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in cartographer traits; "quietly driven in the way of those who cannot stop a question" compels whistle use with earned endurance. Micro-choices reveal values under dread pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from watchers to whistle discovery to CR closure; revelation "Chelonis was not a city on living things but a city on dying ones" reweights premise with conceptual cost on page. Orientation anchored early in Chelonis districts. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shell ridges as streets and pattern languages constrain choices; recurring spiral shell motif charges final image as Olen tightens his own before walking out. Sensory hierarchy (hum in teeth, rust flakes like blood) reflects expertise. Environment evolves causally with crack.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand watchers) signaled early tightens via whistle agency, foreclosing isolation with revelation cost; "question was never what watched... but what would remain" charges image. Accumulative escalation reweights via density. Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impermanence theme emerges organically from shell patterns and empty watchers; final CR "ready to map what came next" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting city premise without moral. Particulars like growth rings drive resonance. Complex ambiguity lingers in dying turtles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in pattern-reading; diction/rhythm modulate dread (thin note to deep hum). No head-hopping or elision issues. Voice reflects expertise without omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm in climax ("A crack split the rust... slow, structural yielding") avoids loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful (rust like dried blood). Zero scaffold, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell-city premise with harmonic whistle and pattern maps feels inevitable; risk in CR revelation transforms tropes organically. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat heightens stakes (+0.3 risk bonus). No derivative echoes.</comment>
