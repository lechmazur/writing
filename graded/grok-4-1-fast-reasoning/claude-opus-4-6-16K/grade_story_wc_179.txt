<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Maren's jaw tightens over resentment as "load-bearing," yet body memory compels release; final micro-choice to set box down with "open hands instead of a fist" earns change with identity-cost felt on page. Scheming pacifist applies patient pressure via box. Interiority embodied in cellular sensations avoids epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cranks to body playing melody, culminating in RR/Charged Poise closure as walls thin and Maren weeps with "melody still humming in her bones." Cost legible in "silence she carried finally shaped like a door." Orientation anchored instantly; one tightening via adapting melody suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-settings (soundless sanctuary, broken pin) constrain choice and charge final image: pin under thumb draws near-blood, forcing confrontation; body as archive mirrors internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (no sound, felt vibrations) purposeful, integrated into action. No white-room; Thessaly cue grounds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release resentment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as melody adapts around gap, narrowing to renunciation with agency in pressing pin then releasing grip. Cost unmistakable in structural collapse risk and final weeping. Pacifist pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grace-as-continuing emerges organically from pin's "shifting grace" and cellular rewrite; final image reweights resentment non-literally as "door instead of wall," inviting ambiguity without moral. No sermonizing; resonance from particulars like lullaby archive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in bodily archive ("cells of her wrists... marrow of her sternum"); rhythmic control modulates from negation to release. Voice distinct, lyric compression taught early via soundlessness. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "reality shifted and deposited" purposeful, no muddle or loops in peak (crank turns). Rhythm varies read-aloud; minor reflection anchors to present cues without drag. Closure image crisp: "weeping freely, the melody still humming."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory and soundless mysticism transforms grief trope; risk in abstract "pacifist architecture" pays off via tangible pin. Inevitable hindsight: box reprise reconfigures absence as grace. No templates; bold bodily literalism heightens stakes.</comment>
