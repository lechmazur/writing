<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in peeling layers despite warnings ("The throne does not want you"), earning the final throne-sitting choice with visible time cost; interiority concrete and particular via field recorder and palm on pulsing tree. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing. Flaws balanced in wise risks that compound stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: peeling → ruby → stairs → throne DC, with sunrise cost legible in "Dawn was minutes away... orchard sealing itself." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene fits scope; no disorientation or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prismatic waterfall and chrome-bark trees constrain choices (light seals entrance by dawn, pulses guide descent); recurring paint layers charge final image as historical weight. Sensory selection urgent and POV-filtered (ozone air, warm bark). Spatial choreography coherent through orchard-to-chamber spiral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim throne before seal) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven peeling/ruby activation narrowing options; sunrise pressure forces stance crystallization with felt cost in committed descent. Escalation coherent under causal lens, no coincidences resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten power reclaimed emerges organically from paint layers (pilgrims' failures) to throne awakening, final image resonating non-literally as "vast and ancient... suddenly awake" reweighting unclaimed sovereignty without moralizing. Complexity in throne's indifference adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (reverent cataloging bias in "monuments... slowly forgetting"); rhythmic control modulates from exploratory to intense ("legs burned... light grew"). No elision or head-hopping; diction fits sci-fi nostalgia.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "ruby flake... sang... ground groaned open"); zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts, rhythm varies naturally without monotony. Figuratives purposeful (e.g., "signal static") and coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data-trees, layered paint history, downward-ascending stairs transforms post-apoc tropes into inevitable throne claim; risk in "unclaimed throne" premise heightens stakes via specific world logic without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
