<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elund's suspicion vs. duty contradiction builds through embodied cuts and pulse-awareness, culminating in earned realization of her eternal corrective role with conceptual cost of timeless attention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as discrepancies and backward counting density tightens to CR closure: clocks converge on approaching future, cost legible in her slanting-script identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fjord's "water lay so still most mornings that the sky seemed to continue downward forever" mirrors clock stillness, constraining horizon-attention and charging key-turn image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of measurement truth deepens via whistle's "torn membrane," forcing agency in key insertion; clocks' halt delivers unmistakable cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "marking something truer than hours" resonates as non-literal answer to clocks' true measure, reweighting particulars like prismatic key without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—"razor edges so fine they split the light into faint prismatic threads"—modulates tightly under pressure, stabilizing close third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in lines like "the hush of deep water holding its breath between mountains" propels with zero loops or figurative muddle through closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Backward-counting convergence to future-date transforms clock tropes into attention-metric, with key's peculiar alloy enabling non-obvious, hindsight-inevitable CR.</comment>
