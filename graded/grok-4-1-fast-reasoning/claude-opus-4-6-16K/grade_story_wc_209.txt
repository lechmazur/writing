<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied ache of "homecoming" earning the final realization; contradictory impulses in grief vs. devotion shown through persistent painting despite isolation. Final change—reckoning inheritance—feels compelled by layered traits without tidy epiphany. No unearned leaps or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from postcards to mural layers to CR closure in sealed postcard and final hush, reweighting premise with emotional cost legible in "neither fully bright nor fully dark." Orientation anchored early in pavilion/thaw; one tightening via dawning hush suffices. No causality breaks or ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber pavilion's light constrains painting method and charges final image ("umbral tenderness"); snow melt evolves causally, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy artist-specific (light angles, translucence). Recurrent glass layers integrate via action, avoiding tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding night-bloomers/mother) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to foreclose grief-path via realization; agency in layered painting endures with felt cost in ache/homecoming. One tightening in hush reweights options without reversal overload. Minor abstractness in stake pre-painting, but on-page tests suffice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (postcards → painted layers → night honesty), final CR image ("flowers bloom at night because night is honest") reweights without stating moral. Resonance from shifting moonflower petals; no platitudes or binaries. Counter-reading plausible in "choosing audience."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in light/flower biases; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in final hush. Diction controlled, prose-as-character reflects quiet drive. No head-hopping or withholding; elisions purposeful for lyric build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., snow melt parallels mural); rhythm varies for propulsion, read-aloud ear clean. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught via glass layers pays off. No loops, scaffolds, or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postcards-as-map and mural-as-night-bloomers transforms grief trope via cathedral glass layers; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars; no template echoes or hedging.</comment>
