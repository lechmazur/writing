<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions like "jealous... of the girl who hadn't yet accumulated all this knowing," compelling endurance in final writing choice with visible cost of futility acknowledged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup from gravestone cue to dream-blurring; Charged Poise closure in "She would keep the dreams" with legible cost of mortality in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mountains and cabin (pine resin, rough-hewn table) constrain isolation and charge final snowline gold image; selective sensory hierarchy reflects jaded POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill dreams) tightens via gravestone scrambling and soaring dream density under Accumulative lens; minor abstractness in jealousy beats slightly mutes visceral cost before earned endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of jaded wonder emerges organically from particulars like thermal soar and howling chest; final image non-literally reweights time-as-line premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in lines like "nostalgia hit her like weather now, sudden and soaking... with teeth"; rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax (short punchy sentences amid lyric flow); no loops or artifacts, propulsion peaks in "she wrote that down too" without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh soar-vs-fly distinction and jealous-past-selves poison transform mortality trope; bold lyric risk in time-scramble synthesis feels inevitable at birch bark closure.</comment>
