<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's arc from certainty-seeking to nuance-embracing culminates in earned placement of the ampoule at the statue's feet, with contradictory impulses (simple moral vs. braided truth) acting via her whispered doubt and final commitment; statue's traits compel testimony without hedging. Interiority embodied in "pressure behind her temples" and ampoule-turning. Closure choice forecloses tidy narrative with felt personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density building to CR closure: Maren's "I'll tell it true" reconfigures premise with cost of "carrying the weight of nuance into a world that preferred certainty." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cascade tightens knowledge without breaks. Final image of statue's softening eyes pays off pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken garden's bioluminescent details ("algae clung to trellises... pulsing in rhythms that resembled breathing") filter through Maren's gaze, constraining swim/proximity and charging final offering/placement. Sensory hierarchy urgent yet warm; evolves with revelations, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (genocide proof vs. care) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via three revelations narrowing Maren's moral options; agency in questioning and ampoule return forecloses certainty. Cost legible in "hardest truths... refuse to be only one thing," charging ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of poison/medicine duality emerges implicitly from foxglove reversal and city choice, reweighting premise in final image: statue "offering something to a visitor who had arrived" answers nuance question without moralizing. Complexity lingers in "love and loss braided together."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (Maren's forensic-historian lens on stains/garden); rhythmic modulation peaks in telepathic precision vs. her whispers. Dialogue subtext-driven, advances via dismantling certainty; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "kelp had threaded itself through the lattice" advances setting/action/theme); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful, ear-test clean even in revelation cascade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken adaptation, consciousness-threading, and foxglove ambiguity transforms tropes; risk in animate stone/telepathy heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from garden's "new life in their ruin" to closure image.</comment>
