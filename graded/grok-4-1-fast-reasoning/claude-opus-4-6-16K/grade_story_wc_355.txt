<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eclectic pacifist traits shown concretely through mismatched earrings, shelves of bowls/radios, and refusal to break clasp compel the core renunciation with embodied tears; contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. non-violence) act simultaneously in tuning scene. Final stasis earned by prior motivation without safety-hedging. No unearned epiphanies; voice particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from catalog descriptions to oscillator hum and recovered silence; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Charged Poise RR in "She did not open the clasp. She did not need to," with legible emotional cost of honored regret. One tightening via resonance suffices; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting (tuning forks, seashells by hush) constrains listening action and charges final image beside "ocean's apology" shell; stars/fireworks contrast heightens stillness. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (frequencies, pen pauses). Environment guides pacifist choice without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover silence before fireworks) signaled early, deepens texturally via heard apology; agency in tuning forecloses opening diary with tears as felt cost. Pressure coheres under lens to crystallized stasis; fireworks complicate without resolving. One decisive intensification at resonance peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via silence emerges organically from particulars (silence labels, heard regret); final image of diary held amid fireworks offers resonant CR repricing forgiveness as "honoring what they could not bear to speak." No moralizing; ambiguity in sealed clasp lingers meaningfully. Protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (silence textures, frequencies) stable in single close-third POV; rhythm modulates from descriptive calm to charged peak ("wept with...frequencies"). Purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short hum sentences amid longer flows); no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent ("silence pools in the margins"). Propulsion peaks in "She heard it—faint, theatrical..."; final line recharges motifs without overwriting. Ear-test flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism, radio tech, silence catalog transforms into frequency-listening ingenuity; risky lyric frame heightens stakes in pre-fireworks hush. Premise non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight via "listen through the cover." Bold risk elevates without gimmick.</comment>
