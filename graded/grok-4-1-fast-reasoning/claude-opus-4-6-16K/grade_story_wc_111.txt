<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in Maren's ritualistic polishing and pragmatic lie, earning her final endurance as the garden leans; flaws like deception complicate without safety-hedging. Marble inscription reveals hierarchy of values with embodied cost in hands. Voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of rituals and anomalies to Charged Poise closure: hedge sways in "windless air," reconfiguring numbers with conceptual cost legible in assessor's stare. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via assessor's anomaly note suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maze constrains choices (Maren reads leans like "sailor reads water") and charges final image (sway toward her); roses' "blooming and withering" mirrors stakes tactilely through POV bias. Sensory hierarchy professional and urgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove garden reciprocity vs. Quantification) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via assessor's scan and anomaly to agency in marble placement; cost felt in fraying deception and unmeasurable sway foreclosing numerical path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of care over data emerges organically via particulars like copper-wired marbles and hedge curve, answered non-literally in final sway reweighting premise; no moralizing, ambiguity in assessor's "see it" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("breath and sweat soaking into this soil") biases toward garden embodiment; stable close third modulates rhythmically under pressure. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("It follows the light").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts; high density propels via varied syntax (e.g., "threading deception... like a vine through lattice"), rhythmic control peaks in closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified luck and sentient garden transforms trope via marble ritual and "nervous system threaded through root"; risk in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
