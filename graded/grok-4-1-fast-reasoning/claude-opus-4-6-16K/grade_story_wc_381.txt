<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation roots deeply in prophecy's spread and mother's gift, compelling precise summoning choices; interiority concrete in feeling silences' textures, embodied exhaustion at end earns reconfiguration with felt cost of self-emptying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silences layer into hush spreading via brook; closure as Charged Poise in origami's inward fold and Elara's weaving into silences reconfigures incompleteness with exhaustion cost legible in "exhausted in the way that emptying oneself always exhausts."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brook and origami constrain ritual—wing floats without sinking, carries silences bidirectionally, charges final image as it darkens and folds; sensory details (moonlight eddies, paper hum) selective via summoner's bias, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hush prophecy tightens accumulatively as silences layer and flow, narrowing noise to lullaby; agency in mapping absence forecloses war path with visible cost of Elara's exhaustion and prophecy's merciful dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence's merciful power emerges organically from layering silences and origami's completion-by-absence; final image reweights prophecy from directive to "kind of forgetting that feels like mercy" without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature—hearing cosmic hum, fingering silence textures—modulates lyrically under ritual pressure; rhythmic prose reflects summoner's craft, no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels from setup to hush's spread without loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (e.g., "tranquil blaze... burns through fog") in peak summoning without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of summoning absence via mapped silences and cosmic origami transforms prophecy trope; risk in tranquil escalation to global peace feels inevitable from ritual's logic, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
