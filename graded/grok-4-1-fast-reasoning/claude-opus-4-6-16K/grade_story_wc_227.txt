<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Maren's doubt ("only guessed") versus persistent shard insertion under submersion pressure; final endurance earned via embodied micro-choices like gripping brass and narrating muffled words, with visible cost of 47 remaining pockmarks foreclosing certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shard insertions build density toward Charged Poise closure in "stitching oblivion's frayed edge closed one breath at a time"; orientation anchored by ~50 words; cost legible in "uncertain whether the completed story would matter," reconfiguring refusal against acid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Workshop gears, acid portholes, and respirator constrain choices (work only between breaths); key ring recurs tactilely ("clinked against the workbench") to charge final endurance image; sensory hierarchy sharpens under crisis to green-black press and copper groans.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning vs. dissolution) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via golden seams quilting fragments amid rising/sinking rhythm; agency in endurance tightens options with felt cost of held-breath labor and persistent 47 pockmarks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-from-fragments emerges organically via kintsugi seams and narrated voices; final image ("gold threads connected... voices from a world that the acid sea had tried to erase") offers resonant non-literal answer to doubt without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (alchemical lens: "quilted themselves together"); rhythmic prose modulates with submersion ("liminal silence where oblivion pressed close"); purposeful compression in memory unspools pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers white around the brass" advances setting, emotion, action); varied rhythm matches sea cycles without loops or artifacts; zero figurative muddle, propulsion peaks in "gasping. Fresh air... flooded her lungs."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Acid-sea workshop and pockmark statue synthesize post-Dissolution alchemy ingeniously; transforms survival trope via kintsugi quilting, with risk-taking lyric accumulation heightening stakes in ongoing submersion without gimmickry.</comment>
