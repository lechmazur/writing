<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobic contradiction embodied in "felt it in her sternum" and mantra repetition during return, compelling higher-stakes endurance with visible physical/mental cost. Interiority particular via ache for erased researchers, driving micro-choices like exhaling through fracture. Final commitment to publish earned by compounded struggle, revealing values hierarchy without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to codex read to escape, culminating in Charged Poise/CR closure where codex retrieval reconfigures erasure into presence ("names... no longer buried"). Orientation anchored early ("Oregon coast... 1971"). Cost legible in tide's turn and endured panic, shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via narrowing passage and rising water ("ankle to shin"), charging final headland emergence against "Pacific spreading... like an opened page." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (drip as "metronome tuned to grief"). Micro-setting (codex, kelp-draped lab) mirrors internal compression without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve codex pre-tide) signaled early, tightens via water rise and claustrophobia peak in return passage. Agency in pressing forward despite "second skeleton" panic forecloses safe retreat with embodied cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density reweights options, legible in "breathed in counts of four."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting forgotten emerges via journal's "phase transitions" paralleling Maren's retrieval, reweighted in final CR: "silence crystallized into sound." Resonance from particulars (gold flecks, Dr. Yun's hand) without statement; lingering ambiguity in ongoing "invisible things."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing ("walls leaning like conspirators"). Rhythmic control modulates tension (short breaths in passage). Prose texture distinct via precise, urgent syntax reflecting Maren's mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, figurative language purposeful ("ocean... pressing its mouth") without muddle in peak beats. Information multi-tasking integrates action/atmosphere. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cable-parasite premise with archival spelunking, transformed via phase metaphor into erasure theme. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specifics like "codex margin illuminant" anchor originality.</comment>
