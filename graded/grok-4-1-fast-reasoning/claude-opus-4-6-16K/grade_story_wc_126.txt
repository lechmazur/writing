<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the playing beat as imposed structure yields to bending phrase; final renunciation of completion earned via embodied tide-rise interruption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to unbinding; Charged Poise closure in "hush answered her" reconfigures options with conceptual cost of embraced incompleteness legible in hum image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wrecks and greenhouse constrain play via hums and rising tide; final silhouettes as "congregation waiting" charge closure image under acoustic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake deepens via unbinding agency under Accumulative lens, foreclosing resolution; cost unmistakable in "unanswered call" persisting as magnificent hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final hum offers non-literal answer to unfinished beauty, reweighting hush and tradition without moral; resonance from particulars avoids platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct acoustic perceptual signature ("micro-fractures singing"); rhythmic control heightens during unbound play, stable third-person limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "sound moved through the greenhouse like water through water"; varied rhythm propels to closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drowned orchard acoustics synthesize eco-loss and music organically; unbinding risk heightens stakes, inevitable from hush constraint.</comment>
