<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in Elise's accident drives precise micro-choices like lever pull, with embodied contradiction in "grief had not broken her reasoning, only sharpened it"; earned stasis in refusing time reversal shows internal conflict acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via descriptive density to CR closure at "waveform that looked like... a laugh she recognized," reconfiguring time as lateral with legible emotional cost in sharpened grief; orientation anchored early, no shards violate scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station's twilight alignment and velith hush constrain 12-minute window, charging final migration image; sensory hierarchy (transparent floor, hum in molars) reflects mechanic's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove lateral time) deepens accumulatively through nexus pulse to laugh echo, narrowing doubt with agency in lever pull; cost felt in trembling hands and foreclosed reversal path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of adjacent persistence emerges organically via nexus shadow and "For Elise, who is not behind me, but beside me," offering resonant CR without moralizing; particulars like velith gradients reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in mechanic's technical gaze ("lattice of superconducting rings"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "holographic interference created a shadow... that moved," no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("data streamed... skewed"), varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds; figurative consistency ("frozen breath") enhances sci-fi texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of holographic time/grief via nexus on velith world feels inevitable; bold sideways premise transformed through mechanic's struggle, no derivative tropes.</comment>
