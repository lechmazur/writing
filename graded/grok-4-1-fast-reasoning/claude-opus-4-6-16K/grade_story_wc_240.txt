<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's spatial giftedness and intrusion-detection mindset concretely motivate her flaw and arc, with contradictory impulses (sealing vs. opening) acting in the spore moment; earned shift at "something in her chest shift — not break" shows visible cost. Minor slip: husband's shrapnel line borders diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from farm glow to spore release to chest permeability as RR/Charged Poise, with legible cost in foreclosed rigid architecture ("let the morning in"). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm and undulating cell walls constrain the demo and charge closure via spores settling on skin, mirroring internal shift. Sensory selectivity (blue-green pulse, pale gold spores) reflects Maren's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via laser demo and spore cascade forcing permeability choice; agency in "Show me again" forecloses sealed-heart path with felt emotional cost at chest shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of selective permeability emerges organically from mushroom barriers to Maren's realization, with final image ("let the morning in") offering resonant answer reweighting intrusion mindset without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with architectural perceptual signature; dialogue subtextual ("You only know how to find what's breaking in") advances stakes. Rhythmic control heightens quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel accumulatively; no loops, purposeful metaphors (quiet wildfire) integrate without muddle, charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion specialist at mushroom farm transforms letting-go trope via bioluminescent barriers; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
