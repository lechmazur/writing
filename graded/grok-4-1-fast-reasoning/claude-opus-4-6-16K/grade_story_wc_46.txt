<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with grief's churn settling via polishing micro-choices; contradictory impulses (dark navigation vs. gentle sharing) act simultaneously until earned stasis in telescope decision. Final renunciation honors legacy with felt cost, per 9+ test. Minor slip: one epiphanic phrase ("gentleness was not weakness") borders therapy-speak but anchors in glass image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density and polishing build to Charged Poise closure in "pearl of stillness" reveal and tomorrow's plan, reconfiguring grief with conceptual cost legible in final tuck/douse/walk. Orientation anchored early (grotto, Lira, night); single scene fits defaults. Cost proof: "long, quiet dark that Lira was still learning to navigate."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist/serpentine walls and lantern constrain reflection's hush, mirroring internal hush; sea glass as micro-setting charges final bloom. Sensory selective (drips, tide murmur) via POV bias toward light. 9+ test met: grotto/recurring glass shape polishing choice and end image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light sans fire) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via polishing/memory to foreclose "burning" path; agency in orbits/reveal narrows options with grief's felt price. One tightening sufficient under lens; cost unmistakable in chest-settling hush. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Light/fire theme emerges organically from glass polishing and bloom, reweighting via final image without moral; resonance from particulars (mother's lens method). 9+ test: ending walk answers "share without consuming" non-literally, recharging motifs. No sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, perceptual signature light-biased ("ribbons of warm amber"); rhythm modulates from memory density to exhale cadence. Compression taught early, pays off legible at closure. 9+ test: signature holds under reflective pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "orbits, pressing just enough"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull propulsion; metaphors coherent (mist as "slow exhalation"). Minor figurative density fits taught lyric pattern without muddle. 9+ test: zero scaffold, clear drive to end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sea glass polishing as lens-making transforms grief trope via specific optics inheritance; risk in lyric stasis heightens quiet stakes. Turn inevitable from mother's method; no derivatives.</comment>
