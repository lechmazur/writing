<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely through counted steps and chest seizing, driving contradictory impulses of fear versus defiance that compel endurance to closure; final climb forecloses panic's path with visible cost in sustained pulse hammering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds impeccably: tunnel mutiny therefore compass resonance, organ chord therefore transfixed walls, guiding to key's DC with endurance cost legible in "She did not stop"; orientation anchored early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrow tunnels and starlight shaft constrain choices, forcing step-counting tactics; organ pipes' reverberation through stone mirrors internal state via selective sensory hierarchy, charging final chamber image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (key amid mutiny/claustrophobia) signaled early, tightens via organ's causal intervention narrowing options; agency in pressing compass forces trade-off endurance, cost unmistakable in closing "walls pressing close."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion against confinement emerges organically from particulars like step-counting defiance; final organ chord and fields under starlight offer non-literal resonant answer, reweighting fear's premise with gratitude's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in arithmetic fear ("turning fear into arithmetic"); rhythmic control modulates under stress, diction biased toward spatial/geometric precision without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory integration (sternum vibration before hearing); no loops or artifacts, figurative language purposeful (moth pinned) without muddle in peak mutiny beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny countered by organ resonance and compass-as-tuning-fork synthesizes fresh premise inevitably; risk in architecture's "restless will" heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming trope via specific acoustics.</comment>
