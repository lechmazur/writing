<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory cunning yields to encode message via foxglove/hellebore, compelling higher-stakes painting; final awakening choice earned by prior causality with trembling hands as visible cost. Interiority concrete in colorblind textures over hues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant cipher → nine-day mural → Fen's weeping configures exchange causally; CR closure lands on-page with legible cost in "trembling... uncertainty." Orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard constrains choices (walls/furnace for mural, failures painted); recurring ash/pots charge final image, filtered via colorblind "orange as... gray." Recurrent object (cracked molds) mirrors stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (reed retrieval) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via encoded plants forcing Fen's cipher-read reaction; agency in "innocently cunning" arrangements forecloses refusal path with on-page awakening cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bartered awakening theme emerges organically from failures transfigured and foxglove accusation; final "trembling... hard-won" image reweights imperfection motif non-literally with conceptual cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: "shapes without... language," modulating to vibratory "mother's laugh"; rhythmic control heightens under awakening pressure, elisions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax ("cathedral of imperfection"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (heat "retreat like a tide"); zero figurative muddle in peak reed beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind vision dignifying glass failures via floral cipher; risk-taking in cipher mechanics heightens stakes organically, transforming phoenix trope through bartered sight.</comment>
