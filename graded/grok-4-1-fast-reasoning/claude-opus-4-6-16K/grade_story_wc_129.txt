<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sable's sculptor traits root motivation and compel carving choice at arbor; Ren's sympathy forces relational crucible via shared search. Internal longing embodied in grafting metaphor shows contradiction between solitude and weaving in. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract peak embodiment but do not touch closure earning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from arrival to glyph trail to Cael reveal, tightening belonging stake; Charged Poise closure at arbor carving reconfigures longing with felt reconstruction warmth/cold contrast. Orientation anchored early in orchard/crater; no lens ambiguity or shards beyond default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain ritual choices and charge final palm-press image; prismatic light mirrors internal luminescent ache through selective POV filter. Sensory hierarchy (light/shimmer tactile via branches) evolves with emotional deepening without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting to community) signaled early, accumulatively tightens via glyph discoveries narrowing outsider status; search forces micro-choices with displacement cost felt in shared silences. Escalation coheres to arbor dedication foreclosing solitude path; minor abstractness in initial ritual explanation slightly mutes early pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reinvented belonging emerges from craft/gestures vs lost languages, reweighted non-literally in final sap-flow image without moralizing. Grafting motif shifts from longing to reconstruction via particulars; Cael's symbols earn resonance without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual signature in sculptor-biased noticing (reed strokes, cambium); rhythm modulates from patient accumulation to charged arbor cadence. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, elision purposeful for textural build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm supporting accumulative ear-test flow; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (light veins, sap flow). Minor figurative density in opening orchard description borders overwrite but weaves into action without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-language world, reed glyphs calling diaspora transforms belonging trope; risk in lyric orchard rituals heightens stakes organically. Arbor dedication turn inevitable from glyph pattern; no derivatives, authentic vision in luminescent ache tone.</comment>
