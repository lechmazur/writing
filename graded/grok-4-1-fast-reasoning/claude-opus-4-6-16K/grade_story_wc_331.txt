<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's interiority shines in concrete embodiment like fingering the frayed scarf amid rearrangement, revealing traits through micro-choices; Paul's observation adds secondary pressure without dilution. Internal conflict emerges subtly in the realization she reawakened rather than created resonance. Minor flaw: grandmother backstory told more than tilting present stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from rearrangement to silence shift; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "Something shifted... books seemed to lean," reconfiguring her conviction with felt coherence cost. Single scene, orientation anchored early in library/shifts. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices via hyperbolic stacks and specific volumes like Neruda/wave interference; recurring scarf charges final image as frequency tuned. Sensory hierarchy (trembling walls, hum below hearing) filters through Maren's priorities. Spatial choreography clear in aisles/nook.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping stories via geometry) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through placements culminating in hum/resonance tightening. Agency in final volume placement forces stance reconfiguration with aching coherence cost. One meaningful deepening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of analog resonance emerges from particulars like marginalia and scarf textures, answered non-literally in books "curved gently toward one another." Subtext in hyperbolic divergence mirrors memory's cost. No moralizing; lingers via charged final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person on Maren with clean Paul glimpse; perceptual signature in "emotional frequency" and geometric lens biases noticing. Voice modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful (e.g., "manifold where meaning propagated"). No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines like "parallel lives diverging" doing multiple jobs; rhythm varies (short punchy finals), no loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherence in geometric motifs purposeful, not muddled. Propulsion peaks in hum beat without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as memory/library architecture transforms tropes organically; risk in "sanely eccentric" filing pays off in resonance. Final reconfiguration inevitable from priors; no derivatives.</comment>
