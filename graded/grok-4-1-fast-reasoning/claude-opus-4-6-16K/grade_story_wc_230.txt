<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rationality as framework compels self-experiments and community sharing with embodied cost (chest splitting open). Contradictory impulses act when she carries the eye despite knowing she should return it. Final endurance earned by prior causality; minor diagnostic phrasing ("involuntarily truthful") slightly tempers peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers from foraging to discovery to preparations, culminating in CR via final image of measured dose reweighting empathy boundaries. Orientation anchored early (climbing ladders into orchard). Cost legible in "rationality was its own form of love," foreclosing total isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storms and root mesh constrain descent and foraging choices (third descent yields eye). Sensory hierarchy via Maren's methodical gaze (roots threading mesh). Orchard sways under storms charges ongoing pressure; recurring grey light mirrors internal occlusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychological safety) signaled early, deepens via eye discovery forcing theft calculus amid virus pressure. Accumulative tightening reweights options in community reveal; agency in truthful sharing and dosing. Cost felt in flinching grief and foreclosed deception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragile boundaries emerges implicitly from virus, truffles, eye; final talisman image offers resonant CR repricing hidden centers without moral. Subtext in "glass eyes now" recharges particulars. No overt statements; ambiguity lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with rational perceptual signature (catalogues burns like scientist). Prose texture modulates from methodical to poised (grinding while eye watches). Jonas dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (each sentence layers world/stake); rhythm varies (short punches in "chest splitting open"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs; "threading their networks through dead wood" clean and purposeful. Zero artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus + fungal cure + prosthetic relic transforms isolation trope via specific neurochemical logic. Risky quiet CR heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from orchard drop to talisman; no hedging.</comment>
