<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in cool-headed patience amid tears during the catch ("braced herself... tears streaked her face"), earning the final endurance of carrying the pulsing word. Interiority particular via emotion-to-frequency lexicon. Flawless single-POV execution with micro-choices revealing values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: densities build from paths to voiced silence to taut line, yielding Charged Poise closure as echo settles into spike with emotional cost ("fierce, aching tenderness"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's standing waves and nodes constrain zigzag tactic and spike placement; rail spike as micro-setting charges final pulse ("pressed her hand against the iron and felt the word pulse there"). Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visual) reflects fisher's ear. Vivid, purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch goddess echo) tightens via star drift signaling window, culminating in agency-driven catch that forecloses hiding echoes with felt cost (bone-transliterated surge). Accumulative escalation via layered actions reweights knowledge of fragments (now holds verb).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of carried word "singing its feral lullaby" non-literally answers mercy/hunger tension, reweighting prior lexicon without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from emotional frequencies and scattered divinity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in frequency-emotion synesthesia; rhythmic control modulates from deliberate setup to taut climax. Stable close-third POV with biased noticing (nodes, harmonics). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "line went taut with a force that was not physical but emotional"); varied rhythm passes ear test, metaphors coherent (fish/echoes). Zero loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak catch beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic architecture and emotional fishing transforms tropes; risk in "voicing silence" inverse heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from spike invention to pulsing word.</comment>
