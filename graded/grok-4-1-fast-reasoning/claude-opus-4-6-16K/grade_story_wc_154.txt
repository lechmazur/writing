<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions (numbness vs. returning sensation) driving the closure choice to write despite anesthetic; "shrewdly innocent" trait enables decryption without safety-hedging; final micro-choice reveals values hierarchy with visible cost in fading consciousness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections on cast notes builds to Charged Poise closure as she writes, reconfiguring trauma into translation; orientation anchored immediately (atrium, surgery); cost legible in "pen slowed but did not stop."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atrium mist and coral constrain choices (garden over bunker-like room) and charge final image ("porous heart"); sensory hierarchy (fog curling like war smoke) reflects POV trauma; no white-room—tactile, lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise) signaled early, tightens via anesthetic deepening that forces endurance; agency in persisting to read/write forecloses sleep option with on-page cost; pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grafting meaning emerges organically from cast decryption to her writing; final coral image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting wounds without moralizing; complexity in shared anxieties avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (translation lens on trauma); rhythmic control heightens pressure ("warm tide climbing"); diction modulates beautifully under stress without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short punchy anesthetic beats vs. lyrical reflections); metaphors coherent ("braille for a language not yet invented") propel without overwriting; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: war translator decrypts child's cast like ceasefire terms, transforming trauma tropes via Pacific specificity; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable closure; no template echoes.</comment>
