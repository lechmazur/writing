<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's reticence contradicts her emerging need to testify, embodied in her cracking voice during practice; final choice to speak imperfectly is earned through prior crystal experiments, foreclosing silent scholarship with transparent innocence as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as daily crystal rituals build to composting revelation; Charged Poise closure lands on-page when she pockets crystal and walks out, reconfiguring options with "weathered innocence" cost legible in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal as micro-setting constrains decoding choices and charges pocketed exit; dawn light and dust motes mirror internal hush, evolving with her decision to leave shadowed library.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding tightens accumulatively to testimony imperative; practice reversal narrows silent endurance option, charging final image with imperfection cost under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of language composting emerges from crystal fractures without statement; final chord-splitting door answers ruin-to-growth question non-literally, reweighting reticence via imperfect proof.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with sonic-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic lyricism modulates from hushed observation to resolute exit, distinct texture intact under decision pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful sonic metaphors coherent across beats; no loops or scaffolds, propulsion peaks in "broken, layered, honest" realization without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh sonic-crystal decoding transforms language-death trope into composting ingenuity; risk-taking in accumulative hush-to-chord synthesis feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
