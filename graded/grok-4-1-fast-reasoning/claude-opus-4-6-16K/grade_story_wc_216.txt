<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in implant countdown and urn shiver compels clock project and group formation; embodied emotions contradict Revision's fluidity; secondary characters (Sable, boy) apply relevant pressure but remain thinly sketched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from clock density to group ritual; orientation anchored in silo/Revision by para 2; Charged Poise closure crystallizes duration with implant cost legible in "pulse against her sternum."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silo's emerald glaze and green light constrain gathering while charging final image; clocks' ticking texture mirrors internal stakes; sensory hierarchy (tactile grain, hummed mysteries) reflects Maren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve sequence vs. fluid Revision) signaled early, tightens texturally via arrivals and rediscovery; implant's countdown forecloses paths with felt cost; agency in messages drives one decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Urn fragment reweights sequence's loss through evolving handling, culminating in timeless present; emergent theme of time's grain avoids moralizing, resonant in clocks' "disagreed beautifully."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in clock textures and Revision distortions; rhythmic modulation heightens crystallization; sparse dialogue natural and goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action without loops; rhythm varies for propulsion, minor figurative density ("dissolved into strange new calendar") in reflection doesn't obscure closure; syntax embodies textured time.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Revision's living math transforms time tropes organically; garage-sale messages and urn capsule synthesize fresh resistance; risk in fluid numerics heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
