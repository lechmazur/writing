<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's jeweler interiority grounds grief in "hands had simply stopped," motivating copper tracing as embodied shift; contradictory withering/bloom resolves in self-brooch without tidy epiphany. Final clasp forecloses denial with skeletal permanence, earned by celestial paradoxes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via origami coordinates to nebula observations, tightening to her heart-origami and brooch; Charged Poise closure reconfigures grief in "tiny constellation across her wrist," cost legible in un-erased "withering."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perpetual dusk and cracked filter glass constrain brooch creation, charging final image where mingled light throws constellations; sensory filter (star-sun) mirrors jeweler's paradox without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grief-halted hands stake signaled early, deepened accumulatively by dying-yet-becoming celestials, agency in folding own origami forces brooch endurance; cost unmistakable in "bone" clasp narrowing denial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Paradox of "real gold holding an absence" reweights via nebulae to brooch's dual shadow/light, resonant answer to withering/bloom without moral; final image lingers ambiguity of "genuine and artificial."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature fuses craft/cosmos ("hair behind crystal" in stars), rhythm modulates from stasis to propulsion; stable single-POV elides origins purposefully, paying off in legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Photons were real; the image was a ghost" packs paradox density with propulsion; zero loops, varied syntax breathes discoveries to closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Astronomy-origami grief therapy synthesizes jeweler's "genuine artifice" into inevitable bloom-from-bone; timeless ridge risks bold lyric scope, transforming tropes without gimmick.</comment>
