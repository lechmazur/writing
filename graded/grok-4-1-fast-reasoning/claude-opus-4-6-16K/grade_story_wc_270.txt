<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Insurgent grandmother's motivation to evolve tradition roots deeply in consistent traits like secrecy around telepathy and past disruptions; contradictory impulses surface in wrestling implanted destiny literally vs. metaphorically before invocation. Micro-choices under pressure, like digging despite heat and invoking alone, reveal values with insurgency cost. Final endurance as "insurgent and ancient and new" earned by prior council friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant agitation → dig → embryo/stone discovery → kite decode → invocation → valley transformation as CR with conceptual cost to standardized tradition. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (hot springs, post-eruption Sable). Hut shard transitions legibly, tightening to dusk closure; no unkept setups, cost legible in "moss sang...plants shuddered."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs vividly constrain: scarred knees in copper water, hot soil dig limits action, ferns/moss as perceptual tools charge telepathy. Final gold water evolution mirrors internal remembering. Sensory hierarchy (chemical urgency, heat) POV-biased, integrated via goal-directed wading/digging; no white-room, geography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition vs. council) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via telepathic distress → embryo → decode tightening options to invocation risk. Agency in unseal forecloses compliance path with deepened insurgency cost felt in crews' arrival. One decisive deepening suffices; moral calculus (tradition's teeth) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of living tradition emerges via particulars: sulfur flowers rejection, embryo hatch reweights premise without statement. Final "tradition...must be allowed to hatch" resonates as CR answer to implanted destiny question, charging prior council friction. Subtext in ferns bending like congregants avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: plant "chemical urgency" selective to telepathy bias. Lyrical voice modulates rhythm for intensity (short invocation sentences), diction controlled (thermophilic moss). No dialogue; free indirect clean, inference matches knowledge (kite puzzle resolved).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "amber was warm and humming...ferns bending" advances plot/atmosphere/emotion). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (embryo hatching ties closure). Propulsion peaks in invocation crack, clean syntax/verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: accidental plant telepathy + kite-script decode unseals destiny seed, transforming trope of elder wisdom into raw invocation. Risky lyric CR heightens stakes via valley shudder; no template echoes, inevitable hindsight from moss whispers.</comment>
