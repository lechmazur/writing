<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via sensations like "electric pressure before lightning"; motivation intensifies through psychometry to compel vial collection with earned endurance. Final sitting reveals hierarchy of values, paying cost of open awakening. Contradictory impulses subtle but act in seeking vs. calm explanation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: descent accumulates to compass reading as decisive deepening, closure as CR in "awakenings do not close again," with cost of unknown pouring through. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Limestone "breathed around her" and lagoon's "resonant hush" constrain choices, charge final breathing image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (petrichor bias); micro-setting (compass in calcium) mirrors internal discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explanations fail) signaled early, tightens via psychometry reversal changing knowledge to deepest petrichor. Agency in reading/collecting forecloses return to science; cost felt in perpetual hinge, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from petrichor/science tension, hinges motif reweights in final vial dash and sitting. Resonant non-literal answer: breathing without understanding recharges prior searches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in aerosol/mineral details; rhythmic control modulates from descent urgency to hushed closure. No head-hopping; diction biased to sensory science.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in varied rhythm (short descent sentences to long lagoon hush); no loops, metaphors consistent ("door swinging open"). Zero scaffold dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Petrichor psychometry fresh synthesis transforms cave trope; compass reprise inevitable from expedition history. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
