<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the "bruise" felt for the community's wound versus logical pursuit, earning the closure choice to send the Charter; interiority particular via historian's lens on "lies nations tell themselves."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as backstory density builds to Charged Poise closure in "drove south with the truth... fragile, dangerous, and absolutely necessary," reweighting options with undeniable conceptual cost legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy-strangled pillars and spiraling petal constrain reflection and charge final image of bare rosebush mirroring truth's fragility; sensory details (fractured glass, rusted boards) selectively filter through Maren's archival priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs cohesion) deepens accumulatively via embodied bruise and prior theft, forcing renunciation with felt cost in packing/sending; no reversal needed, but pressure coheres to foreclose lie's persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies emerges implicitly from Valdersen forgery and Maren's architecture metaphor, resonating non-literally in luminous letter photo and truth's "weight like a living thing" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with historian's perceptual signature ("cataloguer of the lies"); rhythmic control modulates from lyrical opening petal to terse final drive, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., petal verdict anchors time/stakes); varied rhythm and precise diction propel without loops or muddled metaphors, even in reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historian-of-fictions premise with station-as-archive and petal cadence transforms myth-busting trope; risk in heavy reflection pays off in CR closure without gimmickry.</comment>
