<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in freeze vs. deliberate cliff practice compel the earned pearl moment and photo-pinning choice with visible shaky hands cost. Interiority concrete via sensory trauma details like burning hair smell. Therapy-speak minimized and anchored to somatic action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from backstory shards to drill-triggered freeze, culminating in on-page pearl breath and pinning as Charged Poise RR with shaky hands/ crooked lavender cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (arboretum, Noor, post-keeper). No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliff arboretum's salt wind constrains roses/pines success and charges final copper light on needles image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: thyme under boots, greenhouse glass from lighthouse. Micro-setting (sternum hand, cliff edge) enables practice tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stillness amid somatic freezes) signaled early, tightens via drill reversal where agency endures to claim pearl breath, foreclosing fantasy healing path with legible shaky hour cost. Pressure coheres accumulatively without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of holding wound/world emerges via pearl reweighting trauma image (photo pinned beside pines), resonant non-literal answer to healing question in final watering action. No moralizing; ambiguity in imperfect pearl lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in hands-on gardening bias and trauma-narrowed senses (chemical burning hair). Rhythmic control heightens freeze tension to exhale release. No head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "the crumpled photograph... pressed against her heart like a brand" advances emotion/foreshadow). Zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies from meditative lists to sharp freeze sentences. Final line recharges cliff motif propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone survivor grafting literal growth onto trauma stasis via pearl metaphor transforms healing trope. Risky quiet closure via photo-pin/ Aleppo light feels inevitable from particulars, not template.</comment>
