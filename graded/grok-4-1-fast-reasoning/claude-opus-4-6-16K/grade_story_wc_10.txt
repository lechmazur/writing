<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied thermal mappings, like amber at throat for sea memory, revealing character-particular responses; final warmth on sternum earns reconfiguration without epiphany. Contradictory impulses—grief's chord vs. beauty's shake—act in scene, compelling higher-stakes recall of capsizing as drone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mappings densify from halting phrase to full score, culminating in Charged Poise CR where wind gust reconfigures silence with cost (flinch to downbeat). Orientation anchors early (Maren at conservatory threshold post-Adriatic wreck); single scene coherent, closure cost legible in "she already knew the note."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Winterglass panels and spectrums constrain choices by enabling silence, charging final gust image; body as micro-setting (collarbone, mastoid) filters sensory hierarchy through hyperacusis bias. Details purposeful: dampening film swallows vibration, mirroring internal translation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, escalates via accumulative mappings (grief chord, mother's laugh melody) that deepen with pattern break at capsizing drone; agency in sensor calibration and recall forecloses auditory path with embodied cost (shaking hands, sternum ache).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence's fullness emerges organically from thermal phrases and drone, resonant CR in final gust reweighting premise without moral; mother's laugh melody embarrasses yet shakes, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("tuning fork," "downbeat") modulating rhythm under silent stress; diction selective (watercolor spread, Braille light) biases toward composer's notice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm—no loops, metaphors cohere (ribs of beast, watercolor)—peaking in "silence was not empty... full of unshaken marvels" without overwriting; read-aloud cadence breathes with mappings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperacusis and thermal notation transforms disability trope into body-as-score; risk in lyric silence drive feels inevitable, heightened by tuning case reprise without gimmick.</comment>
