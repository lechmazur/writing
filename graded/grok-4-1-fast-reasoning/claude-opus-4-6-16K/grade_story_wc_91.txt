<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (belief in currents vs. orchestrated coincidences) act in scene; final realization "transformation was not something she studied. It was something she was" earned by prior givings with cost of destitution as translucence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density increase to eclipse and bug release; CR closure in "translucence" reconfigures identity, cost legible in empty jar and held glass amid passing shadow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains quest via "texture of transformation, gritty and absolute" under palm; final volcanic glass "sharp and smooth at once, still warm" charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to grasp transformation deepens via agency of unscrewing lid, foreclosing possession; textural pressure coheres to volcano quieting with bugs' halos as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final glass-turning image resonantly reweights givings as self-transformation without moral; prophecy motif emerges organically from particulars, ambiguity in orchestration lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "tiny lanterns refusing to synchronize" and texture bias; rhythmic control modulates hush, POV stable without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with no loops; rhythm varies to propel hush ("vibrant and alive, a silence that somehow contained every color"); purposeful figuratives integrate without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bugs spiraling to lava amid eclipse synthesizes fresh CR from prophecy trope; accidental fulfillment transforms via textural inevitability, risk in lyric passivity heightens stakes.</comment>
