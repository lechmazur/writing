<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "I didn't want this" whisper amid painful transformation; cellular bond and reluctant endurance earn closure choice with embodied cost in shimmering skin and emerging feathers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scent-density buildup to RR closure; fortune's "paradoxically steady" seeds spice ritual, orchard response, and mutual recognition with legible cost in metamorphosis pain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silver-leafed trees and responsive fruit constrain ritual under largest tree and charge final intertwined shadows; moonlight permanence filters POV toward luminous bonds without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled via fortune/spices tightens accumulatively to protagonist agency in yielding to change; cost unmistakable in "not painless" rewriting of cells, foreclosing human form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final stars-as-wings reconfigures love's refusal of ending non-literally, reweighting bond/mortalisim tension from particulars like drifting fortune without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("tearing constellations," solar wind harmonics) modulates rhythmically under stress; stable close-third POV biases toward creature voices and scents.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., spices crush triggers orchard/inner change); purposeful figurative cluster serves textural lens without muddle, though climax ornate risks slight opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mutual phoenix rise transforms rebirth trope via spice reciprocity and fortune seed; cosmic orchard intimacy risks bold scale, heightening stakes through inevitable shared luminosity.</comment>
