<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in meditative stillness and family inheritance, with embodied emotions like "pressure behind her sternum"; micro-choices in rituals reveal values under grief's weight. Final endurance of receding presence earns closure with felt cost. Contradictory impulses in calm thunder culminate in carrying dead forward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds across migration to Charged Poise closure where "presence recede[s], not vanishing but settling"; cost legible in sediment image reconfiguring future mentorship. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse/dusk; one tightening via stone completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse's "iron bones greening with verdigris" and monarchs as "living stained glass" constrain rituals and charge final empty ribs image. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's stillness filters details purposefully; setting evolves with migration, mirroring grief's structure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shaping collective grief—tightens accumulatively through retraced motifs to completion; agency in nightly rituals forecloses aimless carving with receding presence cost. One deepening via monarchs' departure reweights communal shelter of names.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief's architecture emerges organically from ribbon precedents merging into monarch-veined stone; final "carrying the dead forward" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity in luminous inheritance avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic compression like "silence so full it roared"; stable third-limited POV with biased noticing of wings' rhythm. Rhythmic control modulates to thunderous calm at end, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "wings opening and closing in a rhythm she could almost call breathing" integrate without muddle. Varied rhythm avoids loops; final fractured beams image resolves motifs crisply. Minor echo of "thundering calm" purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral hands, ribbon genealogy, and monarch topology transforms gravestone trope into communal architecture; risk in lyric accumulation heightens inevitability of settling presence. No derivative echoes; bold ritual frame feels inevitable.</comment>
