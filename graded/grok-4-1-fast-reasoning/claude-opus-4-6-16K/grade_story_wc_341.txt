<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via cloud-emotion logging under drift pressure; motivation to prove absence's texture compels micro-choices like adding "spooled wholeness" with embodied calm vs. implied panic. Contradictory impulses act in refusing scream while observing stars. Final endurance earned by causal buildup, foreclosing panic with hypothermic cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: string break incites, observations densify to CR closure in logbook's proof-by-deflection, reweighting absence with conceptual cost legible in "empty core still holds the shape." Orientation anchored early; one tightening from data to elegy suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sky gondola and brass telescope constrain choices (drifting forces observation; telescope bends starlight to prove crystals/absence), charging final desk image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (dusty stars, resigned wind); details tactile via creaking, logbook sanded by light. Evolving environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove empty spaces remember) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via logging to rescue; agency in endurance/attention forecloses panic path with hypothermia cost felt on-page. One tightening reweights knowledge (absence as deflection). Pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of textured absence emerges via cloud particulars and spool image shifting to "deflection" realization, resonant in pilot's silence and telescope reprise without statement. Protagonist arc inextricable; final CR reweights premise non-literally. Complexity lingers in "quietly explosive" ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in idiosyncratic noticing (clouds as grief, stars "dusty"); rhythmic control modulates from calm observation to faster writing under drift. Stable single POV; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers image/action (e.g., "pressed her eye to the brass telescope" advances stakes). Rhythms vary naturally; metaphors coherent (spool, deflection). Minor figurative density in peak logging beat but pattern-taught, no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology-emotion (64 cloud feelings) transforms absence trope via deflection proof, inevitable in logbook circulation. Bold risk in emotional classification premise heightens stakes; no derivatives, authentic vision coheres.</comment>
