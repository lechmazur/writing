<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in vulnerability, embodied in her nightly scope ritual and meteor empathy; contradictory impulses surface in "fragile attention as an answer," earning endurance at closure without epiphanic tidy-up.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to meteor pause as pattern break, delivering Charged Poise closure in final image ("glass to her chest and breathed") where cost of smallness reconfigures cosmic intimacy legibly on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Basalt ridge and iron staircase anchor vividly; yellow lantern glass as micro-setting constrains choices (e.g., filtering afterglow) and charges closure image indelibly through POV-biased sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vulnerable intimacy tightens via anomaly pause, forcing endurance agency; cost felt in foreclosed flinching, though escalation subtle under accumulative lens lacks one sharper option-narrowing turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of strength in stillness emerges organically from particulars, answered non-literally by final station hum and stars' paths "only the vulnerable could read," reweighting premise with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., stars' "silence behind it"); rhythmic modulation heightens stillness, no slippage, voice coheres as solitary wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax mirroring cosmic hush; zero loops/artifacts, metaphors purposeful (e.g., "prayer bowls") without muddle, even in peak afterglow beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of overlooked janitor's devotion transforms trope via yellow glass and anomalous pause; risk in lyric poise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
