<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's pacifism by marrow drives micro-choices like burying the scrap and redirecting the militiaman, earning her endurance with embodied contradiction in handling father's legacy. Perceptive reading of the boy's "tremor in his hand" reveals character under pressure without labels. Final renunciation of violence coheres with traits, foreclosing aggressive paths with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of rose rituals and visitor interactions builds to Charged Poise closure in "root by root, word by word, that would not fall," reconfiguring tower's loss with conceptual endurance cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early via roses and dome. Single scene fits defaults, one tightening via boy's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome's "glass cage" and glowing roses constrain choices as intact haven amid chaos, charging final lantern image across flats. Sensory hierarchy (roses' petals, sand palm-press) filters through Sera's perceptual bias. Evolving details mirror internal persistence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to weave continuity tightens accumulatively via survivors and boy's knife query, narrowing to her pacifist endurance that forecloses violence with cost in softened visitor and her isolation. Agency in "You can sheathe it" forces stance crystallization. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inculcated persistence emerges from particulars like scrap burial and rose whispers, resonant in final reconfiguration without moralizing. Boy's weeping grafts pain to growth, subtextually answering chaos via quiet continuity. Complexity lingers in her marrow-deep choice vs. father's steel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "senselessly perceptive" attunes to roses' warnings and boy's grief, with rhythmic prose modulating from tranquil to charged. Stable third-limited POV, minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("Nothing here needs cutting"). No head-hopping, diction biased to her pacifist lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images ("roses glow like living coals"); rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in boy interaction). No loops, metaphors coherent (engraved quiet), figurative language purposeful in lyric accumulative mode without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of post-tower pacifist gardening transforms apocalypse tropes via value-inculcating ritual, with fresh "plants absorb...roots wound around meaning." Risky lyric quietness heightens stakes of persistence, inevitable in hindsight from early rose attunement.</comment>
