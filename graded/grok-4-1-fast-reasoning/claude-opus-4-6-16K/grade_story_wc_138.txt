<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vael's interiority shines in embodied details like the amulet "burning against her skin, fighting her," revealing contradictory curiosity vs. curse without labels. Final witness choice earned by centuries' buildup, foreclosing escape with acceptance cost. Contradictory impulses act in the seam moment, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm tremors build to mutiny, seam CR reconfigures immortality premise with legible cost in "she let it" close. Orientation anchored early in Escondite/curse. No lens ambiguity; closure image of "hand to the narrowing light" proves cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prismatic corridors constrain via shifting chaos ("floors became ceilings"), charging final convergence point. Sensory hierarchy (hums, tastes of iron/ozone) filters through Vael's awareness, mirroring internal shift. Recurrent colors evolve causally, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness afterlife) signaled early, escalates via storm agency tightening to amulet resistance; seam vision forces renunciation with cost of endured immortality. Single deepening under Accumulative lens reweights options legibly on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from vision: mortals as "architecture of everything," reweighting boredom via "After" whisper without statement. Final image answers "what happens after goodbye" non-literally, passing 9+ test; ambiguity lingers in acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dimensional details ("membranes between realities"); rhythmic modulation peaks in chaos ("screamed in colors that tasted of iron"). No elision issues; prose as character reflects ancient calm under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines like "hushed thunder, rolling beneath every thought" propel without loops; varied rhythm accelerates in mutiny. Figuratives purposeful, no muddle or scaffolds in peak beats, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: immortality via dimensional "spatial mutiny" during storm transforms boredom trope into witness payoff. Risky prismatic chaos heightens stakes organically; final "After" feels inevitable, earning +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
