<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through folding cranes as embodied grief; final unfolding earned by fear-tension in striking lantern. Contradictory impulses peak in "afraid it would be dark... bright," compelling shift with visible cost in weeping. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lanterns/cranes to 20th playback as CR, reweighting grief with emotional cost in "luminous torment pouring through her." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent. Closure image of drawing reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting vivid/selective: shadow detaching constrains timing, pavilion/crane mobilities charge final image; basilica spires "fracture the dawn" mirrors internal fracture. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (bergamot, thermal drafts). Environment guides choice via shadowless interval.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront final dream vs. fold indefinitely) signaled early, tightens via shadow detach to playback; agency in striking crystal forecloses folding path with on-page weeping cost. Accumulative deepening reweights via impossible dream vision. No abstract stakes; visceral in shaking hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from folding/unfolding particulars; crane motif shifts at "dreamed it first, dreamed it better," resonant non-literal answer in drawing as unfolding permission. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in grief/grace synthesis. Final image recharges premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (grief as "light — blinding, relentless"); rhythmic modulation peaks in dream sequence. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. Voice distinct, biased noticing (basilica as "frozen prayer").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/scaffold; rhythm varies (short strikes amid long builds), propulsion syncs pressure—no overwriting as metaphors cohere (light/grief/gems). "Shadow detaches" opener anchors; final "held it gently" resolves image-charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-gem lanterns + origami grief-crane alchemy transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric fantasy yields inevitable "descends while ascending" turn from particulars. Bold non-causal Accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
