<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via embodied listening ("silence... ringing in her bones"); micro-choices under pressure (bell strikes evolve to "answer it") reveal shift from matching to openness, earning change with cost of abandoning reconstruction. Contradictory impulses act in scene: precision vs. revelation via lens-to-ear. Final renunciation ties to grandfather's lamp purpose, deeply character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed bells to lens-to-ear pivot ("the mine shaft has leaned closer"), culminating in CR closure ("connection... is the willingness to be changed") with conceptual cost of reweighting her craft legible in final bell strike and textured silence. Orientation anchored early (lab, Maren, post-blackout). One tightening via lens use suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Carbide lens as micro-setting constrains pivotal choice (held to ear, altering sound presence) and charges final image ("golden shadows settle"). Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant, POV-filtered (overtones "split into gold and violet"); lab specifics (extinct frequencies, electromagnetic locks) integrate via action. Object evolution mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection via reconstruction) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when lens-to-ear deepens presence, forcing trade-off (fidelity vs. change). Agency in questioning/striking crystallizes stance; cost felt in foreclosed accuracy path, charging final "living room" recognition under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection-as-listening emerges organically from particulars (mine moan, grandfather's faces, answering bell); final image ("trembling border... luminous seam") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting reconstruction premise. Subtext in silence's "warm, granular" texture avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (harmonic spectra, sound textures as "grain and weave"); rhythmic modulation builds to revelation ("enormous and quiet and everywhere"). Diction controlled, lyric compression taught early via bell overtones.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "golden shadows pool across her fingers" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (overtones "splitting into gold and violet"), coherent in peak revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct sounds lab + bell craft + lamp talisman transforms epiphany trope via Textural lens; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with "prism-song" premise inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity to CR closure.</comment>
