<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in concrete traits like voluntary chain-wearing; "freedom was not a state but a practice" reveals hierarchy of values with embodied cost. Micro-choices under scout pressure show contradictory calm and strategy without tidy rationalism. Final endurance earned by prior causality, foreclosing violence path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: key decoding → hatch → scouts → misdirection → seeds → wall explosions as Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; persistent chain constraint shapes tactics throughout. Cost legible in final chain-on-asphalt image amid chaos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "faded to ghosts" signage and "matted with years of rain" fur constrain hiding and decode; piano bench/ tile directly charge choices. Sensory hierarchy narrows to boots/clink under crisis. Final asphalt mirrors internal resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure seeds undetected) signaled early, tightens via scout arrival forcing non-violent agency in misdirection beat. Causal escalation narrows options; visible risk cost alters exit tactics into charged chaos poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-reliant resilience emerges organically from seed theft and chain image; final "desert dream of green" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in false arrow trail invites ambiguity on resistance learning curves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of strategic lyricism ("clanking... became music"); diction/rhythm modulate seamlessly under stress. No head-hopping or withholding; voice biases toward drought-hardened details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances via image/action; rhythm varies (short crisis sentences amid longer reflections). No loops/artifacts; figurative like "percussive accompaniment" purposeful, no muddle in peak misdirection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Piano-key code and seed-husk arrow transform post-apocalypse tropes into fresh synthesis; risk of non-violence amid scouts heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from carnival vault premise.</comment>
