<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between exposing and salvaging act in scene via instincts overriding prior quest; final renunciation of exposé earned by father's seeded lies becoming communal truth, with embodied cost in sundial's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflections densify to CR closure—"She would write the book—not the expose"—reconfiguring truth/lie premise with conceptual cost of rubble vs. roots; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sundial constrains realization (bent gnomon, dark uselessness mirrors legend context) and charges final image (set on deck); canal lapping, barge lights filter through reflective POV, evolving with darkening sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comprehend vs. dismantle lies) deepens accumulatively via instinct-trained reversal, foreclosing exposé path; cost legible in "tear them down now would... create rubble," charging poised book decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of constructed truth emerges from sundial/legends particulars, reweighted in final image without moral: lies "grow roots... indistinguishable from the earth"; resonant non-literal answer to architecture query.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in diver-lung instincts, architecture metaphors; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation—"serene upheaval"—under reflective pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "sundial in darkness tells you nothing. A legend in context tells you everything"); varied rhythm propels to crisp closure image, flawless read-aloud ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fraud-as-folklore with quiet CR ending transforms trope of legacy reckoning; risk in lyric stasis heightens stakes via salvaged lies' irreplaceable conceptual cost.</comment>
