<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's expectantly resigned trait embodies contradictory purpose—preserving vanishing arts via transience—with micro-choices like "Again, less" revealing hierarchy of values; students' grudges apply crucible pressure, earned release via process closes arc with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of unlearning; orientation anchored in first paragraph; closure as Charged Poise RR in rosette placement and "That is where the sound comes out," reconfiguring silence/music with conceptual cost of "nearly lost" legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn light selectively constrain quiet method and mirror internal states; rosette as recurring micro-setting charges final image, guiding explanatory choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of braiding voices amid hatred tightens accumulatively to pure harmony; agency in subtraction method forces endurance/renunciation of grudges with felt cost in "tightness, sharpness" released on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via subtraction emerges organically from process/images, not statement; final rosette/singing offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting vanishing premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Maren with distinct perceptual signature in musical metaphors; prose rhythm modulates from stillness to emergence, purposeful compression taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm propels via integrated action/image; metaphors coherent (e.g., "river uncovers stones") without muddle or loops, even in dense opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms choir trope into unlearning hatred via subtraction method; quiet closure risks stillness yet heightens stakes through rosette's irreplaceable charge.</comment>
