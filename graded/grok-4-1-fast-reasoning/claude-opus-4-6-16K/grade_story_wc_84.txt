<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's drone-pilot background roots her motivation and perceptual bias, enabling concrete interiority like "distances lived inside her"; pilgrim's surprise trait is vivid but underutilized for pressure. Earned change at "something shift in her chest" feels embodied. Final choice to recalibrate reveals values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chip filters data into waveform via motivated ellipsis, tightening to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "missing pieces didn't feel like absence anymore. They felt like invitation." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory's equatorial mount and transit telescope constrain analysis, charging final image of "dome framing the sky like cupped hands." Sensory hierarchy (stars as "punctuation marks") reflects Maren's bias. Micro-setting (chip perforations as star trails) guides pivotal tilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging frequency) signaled early, accumulates density to breath-like waveform, narrowing options from absence to invitation. Agency in placing chip and recalibrating; felt cost reconfigures internal terrain under Accumulative lens. No reversals needed; tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as resonant gaps emerges organically from chip patterns and waveform, answered non-literally in final "silence between notes." No moralizing; complexity in "gaps are the point" lingers with ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from reweighted premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (terrain scanning transposed to stars); voice modulates rhythmically, e.g., "stars multiplying overhead." Dialogue subtextual ("Maybe the gaps are the point"), distinct idioms. No head-hopping; diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax; metaphors cohere (star trails, breath cadence) without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm breathes with dusk deepening. Final line "listened for what the gaps were trying to say" recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes typesetter chip with drone spectrograph into fresh frequency-of-belonging frame; star-trail perforations transform trope of signals. Risky lyric closure feels inevitable, heightening stakes via conceptual cost without gimmickry.</comment>
