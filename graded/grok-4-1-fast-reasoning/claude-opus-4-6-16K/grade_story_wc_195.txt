<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in trembling hands recognizing patterns from his hollowed past, compelling the final bare-faced surrender with embodied terror and radiance; no unearned epiphanies, traits shown through micro-choices like unsnapping armor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: program discovery accumulates density toward reality's final reconfiguration, with Charged Poise closure in the crystalline frost image bearing surrender's cost; orientation anchored early in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alchemical details like mercury pears and breathing soil constrain choices and mirror internal shift, charging the final fractured dark; sensory selection (glowing blue, gold resin, metal scents) purposeful and POV-filtered through knightly notice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconnection deepens via pattern recognition tightening to undressing spiral, reweighting isolation under accumulative lens; agency in whispered vow forecloses withdrawal with legible emotional cost at visor drop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pledging to unformed possibility emerges organically from puppet rituals to orchard response, final image resonantly reweighting premise without statement; ambiguity in "not holding but giving form" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with knightly perceptual signature (armor as "walls," patterns as "second skeleton"); rhythmic modulation builds to climax, purposeful compression in vow legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("roots threaded through lead pipes and emerged as silver filament"); varied syntax and zero loops/artifacts sustain momentum to closure's bright frost, read-aloud ear clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knightly oaths as puppet choreography amid factually mystical orchard transforms tropes organically; risk in reality-shifting closure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from program pivot.</comment>
