<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interior contradiction between performing equanimity and true vulnerability peaks in the reversal epiphany ("his serene composure... was not strength"), earning the final admission with embodied cost; Petra applies sharp pressure as foil. Flaws absent in closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via reflective density building to CR closure ("That's where the real story starts"); starlight shift anchors orientation early; cost legible in "terrifies you" exchange and final dome image reconfiguring artistic stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's crack and shifting starlight constrain reflection and charge final image ("a broken receiver still listening"); sensory hush (creosote air, ringing echo) mirrors internal reversal without overt symbolism. Micro-setting as body/object (story stick under blade) elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical art) signaled early, tightens via reversal deepening ("reverse the lens entirely"); agency in admission forecloses exploitative path with terror cost, legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ethical reversal emerges from puppet details and dome image, resonating without statement; final line reweights premise ("signals it was never designed to understand") as non-literal answer to exploitation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (calligraphic lens on puppets, "unsettling beauty") stable; dialogue subtextual ("You were right... That terrifies you") advances goal; rhythm modulates from hush to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "blade of starlight... halved skull" does image+atmosphere+theme); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in epiphany without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher-puppeteer in bars transforms trauma-telling trope; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes via dome's "broken receiver" reconfiguring reception of pain.</comment>
