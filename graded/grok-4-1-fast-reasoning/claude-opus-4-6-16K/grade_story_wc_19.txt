<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in coping via exposure limits yet risking inversion; doll's "second heartbeat" embodies emotion; "I sprouted" earns reconfiguration via silence quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens accumulates silence flavors to "gilded hush" RR/Charged Poise; cost legible in father's "you could have died" and stretched chest; pattern taught early, holds to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Xenial trellis as micro-setting constrains suspension and charges final image; silence "tastes" filter sensory hierarchy through POV; bunkers' "throats" mirror internal state purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of peace silence tightens accumulatively in inversion; agency in defying bunker for trellis forecloses safety path; cost visible in death risk and paternal anger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Gilded hush" reweights contracted quest non-literally, emerging from doll, silences, inversion; resonance from particulars avoids moralizing; invites ambiguity in "sprouted."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in silence "flavors"; diction/rhythm modulates to hush's "warmth"; father's dialogue natural, subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; density peaks propulsively in "silence wearing light"; metaphors consistent, no muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Silence taxonomy and "sprouted" synthesize inversion world boldly; trellis/vines transform tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
