<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in gaps research drives all choices, culminating in earned library access; traits like resourcefulness shown in rationing/mapping constrain risks effectively. Minor slip: embodied emotions lean toward summary ("obsession") rather than peak contradiction in ascent beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: diary study therefore language mastery therefore rescue DC leading to CR closure ("She opened the first book, and the mountain sang") with conceptual cost of endless mission. Orientation anchored in opening line; one tightening via code-breaking narrows unmapped risks perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain's corridors-as-pipes constrain ascent choices via frequencies; humming books charge final image. Sensory details (ozone smell, vibrating spines) filtered through linguist's ear bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (rescue for library) signaled early, tightens via diary decode forcing renegotiation agency; visible cost in gaunt scholars and "real mission just beginning." Escalation causal under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening to refused wisdom emerges via gaps → mountain's voice; final singing book reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like pressed flowers code.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with linguistic perceptual signature (notices scripts, frequencies). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("renegotiate with the mountain"); rhythm modulates tension without filter stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; syntax varies propulsion (short sentences in ascent: "Walls parted. Stairs unfolded."). No overwriting, metaphors coherent (knowledge as geology).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sentient bookstore-instrument + temporal fissure transforms labyrinth trope; risk in "mountain sang" closure inevitable from voice-mapping buildup.</comment>
