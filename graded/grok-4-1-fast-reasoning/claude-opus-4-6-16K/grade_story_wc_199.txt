<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orderly traits compel shift from sorting to building at leaf symbols, earning transformation into translator; embodied joy "moss-green delight...spreading outward" reveals character under pressure without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: leaf patterns deepen to monuments, culminating in arbor's shudder and moth image as RR/Charged Poise with conceptual cost of eternal bridging; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor's petrified platform and falling leaves constrain sorting/building choices and charge final moth shadow; sensory veins/shifts filter through Lirren's precise gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode leaves) tightens via prodding/building agency under accumulative lens, foreclosing mere order for endless service; cost legible in "fresh seeds of meaning...began again."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of order restoring forgotten emerges via monuments to grandmother/river, reweighted in final endless cycle without moralizing; resonant in moth dissolving to new leaves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (symbols as "prayers," leaves "speaking") modulates precisely; stable close third-person POV teaches pattern early, pays off cleanly at arbor response.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel from sorting to climax without loops; "moonstone...refracting the spiral-and-tooth into a constellation" integrates image/action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore-prophecy via leaf algorithms and seed-cairns transforms mythic tropes; risk in accumulative monument-building heightens inevitable moth payoff.</comment>
