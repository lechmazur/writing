<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Preemptively nostalgic trait embodied in "mourning the listening even as she listened," driving contradictory endurance to write despite loss; final renunciation of surrender earned through prior micro-choices like measuring shadows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shadows anomaly accumulates to crystal hymn and conjecture, yielding Charged Poise closure in quill set down amid hush; cost legible in "she did not know if the fog would thicken further."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt constrain choices (shadow measurement, ear to wet crystal) and charge final whisper image; sensory hierarchy via Maren's priorities vivid and selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recording shifting memory tightens texturally via shorter shadows to hymn-grief, forcing conjecture agency; cost felt in adaptation's foreclosure of old sky-identity, unmistakable in hypothesis paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-adaptation emerges organically, resonant non-literal answer in final listening to hush reweighting nostalgia without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with nostalgic perceptual signature ("ghost-shapes of words"); rhythmic control modulates hush intensification seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax ("The shadows told her things. Not the future, exactly."); zero loops, no figurative muddle in peak conjecture beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quill-shadow-crystal archiving transforms memory trope; risk in solstice hawks and fog-crust world heightens stakes organically.</comment>
