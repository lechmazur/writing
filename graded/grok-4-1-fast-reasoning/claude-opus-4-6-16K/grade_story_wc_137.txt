<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic's contradictory impulses—cartographic precision vs. instinctive kindness—embody in stuttering hand during transcription; final stewardship earned via accumulated memories without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density of surfacing memories; "Maren gasped and nearly dropped the chalk" delivers first tightening, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("wept for people she had never met") with emotional cost legible in weeping image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whale song vibrating "up through the rock foundation into Maren's boots" anchors sensory urgency, constrains transcription via shifting symbols by starlight, and charges final "morning that hummed with frequencies."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Skepticism vs. dying-wish stake signaled early tightens accumulatively at halfway memory intrusion ("hand stuttered"), forcing endurance with embodied cost in gasp and continued chalk work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship-before-belief emerges organically from entangled particulars; final "pocketed the tile, descended... morning that hummed" offers resonant non-literal reweighting of skepticism without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with cartographer's perceptual signature ("symbols seemed to shift depending on the angle") modulates rhythm under memory pressure, sustaining biased noticing without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High-density propulsion varies syntax from setup ("chalk in hand") to peak ("gasped and nearly dropped"); zero loops or muddle, with purposeful figurative economy like "dark ocean turned upside down."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magic square entangling memories via whale-song resonance transforms skepticism trope into fresh conceptual synthesis; risk of "foolish" transcription pays off inevitably in humming dawn reconfiguration.</comment>
