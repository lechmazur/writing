<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in doodle recognition drives her to the forecourt, with embodied tension in studying tickets evolving to earned choice at ledger signing; Jonah applies immediate pressure as foil. Internal conflict clear in thawing suspicion without tidy epiphany. Minor reflection on past belief tilts present without flattening; final micro-choice reveals values hierarchy with institutional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ticket backstory through confession to Charged Poise closure in ledger signing and shared hush, reconfiguring mistrust with felt relational cost. Orientation anchored early in forecourt details. Single scene coherent; cost legible in "She signed her name beneath his testimony," foreclosing safe disbelief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt vividly sensory (hum pitch shift, water mirrors), filters through Maren's registrar priorities, mirroring internal thaw; constrains by eavesdropping vibe charging final hush. Recurrent hum evolves causally with rain/memory, charging closure image without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (ledger, lens) sharpens pivotal view through lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (verify Jonah's truth) signaled via doodles, tightens accumulatively to lens proof forcing stance crystallization; agency in examining lens and signing ledger forecloses denial with institutional risk cost. One deepening reversal via confession narrows options under lens. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honesty thawing mistrust emerges organically from doodles, lens, signing; final hush image resonantly reweights suspicion-as-myth without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures (pushing lens); epiphany earned via concrete handling. Complexity in institutional power lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited to Maren with perceptual bias (doodle tremors, crystal eavesdropping); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm to hush cadence. Dialogue sparse, subtext-driven ("You drew a door"); distinct idioms (her precise, his direct). No head-hopping; elision of past taught early, pays off in trust.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "The forecourt hummed around them, crystal singing with the memory of rain"); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax propels to closure hush. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative purposeful (light through crack). Zero artifacts in peak signing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: doodle code on tickets luring to crystal forecourt for lens confession transforms wrongful dismissal trope via registrar's evidentiary gaze. Risky lyric hush closure heightens resonance without gimmick. Particular details (quartz-veined stone, crosshatch light) anchor originality; no derivative echoes.</comment>
