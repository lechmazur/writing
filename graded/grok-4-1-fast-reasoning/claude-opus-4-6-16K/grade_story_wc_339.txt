<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand letting go is rooted in grief and analytic traits, with embodied interiority via snow globe physics; final reconfiguration earns closure via prior patient dives. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("quietly analytic") slightly abstracts, but impulses act in scene with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through dives to log discovery; CR closure ("Laughter. Then silence.") reconfigures grief with conceptual cost legible in snow globe fall. Orientation anchored early; lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library and snow globe as micro-settings constrain choices (descent, conservation) and charge final image; sensory details (blue silence, salt-ink marriage) filter through analytic POV. Purposeful, vivid integration avoids tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) deepens accumulatively via micro-discoveries to revelation; agency in patient untangling forecloses prior holding with felt emotional cost at peak. Entry to 8.8+ via legible price charging image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from transmissions, snow globe, laughter/silence into resonant non-literal answer reweighting grief without moralizing. Particulars drive complexity; final image offers charged reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (threads, frequencies, physics) modulates rhythm under reflective pressure; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and zero loops/artifacts; figurative language (snow like static) purposeful without muddle in peak discovery beat. Propulsion aligns with scene needs, clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart mystery as grief lens via snow globe physics; transforms tropes through analytic lyricism, with risk-taking in reflective accumulation heightening closure stakes organically.</comment>
