<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via nerve grafts translating data into spatial awareness; final reconfiguration from passive mapping to active pursuit earned by accumulated visions. Contradictory grief and determination embodied in "weight... like ballast." No unearned epiphanies; flaws (blind persistence) compound until mother's truth forces pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shard visions densify map to CR closure ("weight... settled... ballast") with conceptual cost reweighting exile as love. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; one tightening via final vision completes coordinates. Shard cracking as persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nerve grafts as micro-setting constrain perception/choice; bay's "ghost signals" and "corroded hull plating" filter through professional bias, charge final "universe hummed with directions home." Sensory hierarchy vivid under urgency. No white-room; evolves causally from abandoned to operational in shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) signaled early, escalates via density of crossings to vision's deepening that narrows to accountability. Agency in predicting activations; cost legible in "years of grief" and shard's fracture. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of withheld truth's ballast emerges organically from mappings and vision; final image resonant non-literal answer to silence vs. love without moralizing. Shard shifts from key to spent relic, recharging prior grief. Complexity in administrators' self-protection lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in grafted sensations; diction/rhythm modulates from mapping precision to gasping release. Vision dialogue reported naturally, advances revelation. No head-hopping; perceptual bias consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines like "hummed with coordinates that didn't belong" advance sensory data, character, stakes. Varied rhythm accelerates to "bay dissolved," breathes in realization. Zero loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks clean at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory cartography and multiverse shard-weaving transforms slip-drive trope; risk in mosaic visions pays off in CR. Nerve grafts as original constraint heighten ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
