<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's endurance against grief compels weaving choices with embodied cost in aching hands and daily refusal; contradictory impulses (grief vs. purpose) act in persistent craft, earning silence's reversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as weaving density culminates in RR closure at Lien's arrival and hand on tapestry; "latent sacrifice woven into every row" makes cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bamboo stalks and wild pear orchard constrain frame/resources and isolation, charging final clearing reunion; selective sensory details (knocking bamboo, iron-taste stream) mirror raveling silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of impossible-distance message tightens texturally through puzzle recommencement and bead encoding; endurance forecloses normal paths with life-expenditure cost felt in seasons passed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Particulars of patchwork weave and beads yield emergent theme of intentional persistence reversing silence; final "threads gathering inward" reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with weaver-biased perceptual signature in thread/raveling diction; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels time-lapse; consistent weaving metaphors avoid muddle, as in "bamboo knocked its hollow music" charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Jigsaw-puzzle loom transforms separation trope via grounded craft ingenuity; accumulative risk heightens stakes, inevitable in bead-reading closure.</comment>
