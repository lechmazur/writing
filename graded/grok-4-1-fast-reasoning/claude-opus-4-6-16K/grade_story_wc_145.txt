<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular through cartographic lens ("seventeen years of staring at blue lines"); motivation intensifies to compel walk onto ice with embodied warmth at fingertip; earned CR via precise confidence confronting blankness/erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density from separate rivers to overlaid convergence reconfigures source logic; CR closure legible in "warm" moisture and outpost exhale as conceptual cost of confirmation over discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass condensation constrains revelation and charges final clearing; lake's blankness mirrors/contrasts internal quest, narrowing to center walk; sensory hierarchy (warm vs. frozen) embodies cartographer's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (source pattern) signaled early, tightens via simultaneous overlay forcing stance crystallization; agency in interpretation and exit walk pays conceptual cost, unmistakable in "blank and full of beginnings."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (source/memory/pattern) emerges organically via Evenki root and converging lines; final image non-literally answers "where rivers begin" by reweighting blankness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (rivers as "veins," "dialects") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from unsettled observation to poised close; stable limited third-person with no elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density (e.g., "frost sometimes resembles ferns" purposeful not overwritten); propulsion peaks in convergence beat with varied syntax charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and surreal hydrology (patterns as "grammar"); risk in CR walk transforms trope of frozen isolation into origin affirmation, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
