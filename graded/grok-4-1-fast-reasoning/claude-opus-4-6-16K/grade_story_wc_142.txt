<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's dual allegiance creates genuine internal conflict shown through her reorganization efforts amid love for wildness and newcomers' stability; micro-choices like imprinting the stone chip on the mural reveal values under pressure. Olu's brief appearance applies secondary pressure via his shifted allegiance. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts embodiment but anchors present actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from crisis feel to mural-painting Charged Poise closure; "We only need forty" crystallizes reconfiguration with drowning cost felt in final belief. Orientation anchored early in eastern platform dawn. Single-shard scope fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raft city carnival vividly constrains communication via graffiti blending into aesthetic; foundation chip as recurring micro-setting charges closure imprint. Sensory hierarchy (drums, fog, saxophone) reflects Maren's intuitive pressures. Spatial choreography clear across platforms and pontoons.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake against privatization signaled early tightens accumulatively via signatory mural and Olu's coffee/counteroffer; agency in encoding directives forecloses fracture path. Escalation coheres texturally to Charged Poise with visible communal shift cost. One deepening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective becoming emerges organically from graffiti signals and allegiance shifts, reweighted in final dawn image without moralizing. Subtext in hands-over-cracked-stone mural answers fracture question resonantly. Particulars like stone imprint avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Maren-specific perceptual bias (pressure points as weather); rhythmic prose modulates from dawn quiet to carnival throb. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("Sixty days"/"We only need forty"), advances allegiance. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing texture or stakes; varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in painting beat) propels without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (synaptic streamers, shock absorber) enhance without muddle. Clean, vivid specificity throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Graffiti-as-directive in carnival Flotilla transforms gentrification trope freshly; stone-chip seal and "shock absorber" frame offer non-obvious synthesis. Risky accumulative lyricism heightens communal stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
