<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Maren's possession flicker visibly ("two voices diverging"), and Elias's final pedal lift earns stasis with embodied cost in her cleared eyes; minor abstract interiority ("cathedrals of pause") prevents flawless 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with silence layers densifying to CR closure at "I assumed that I was empty," where palette cracks as legible conceptual cost; orientation anchored early in anchor station, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Loop pedal and palette constrain choices (footwork layers silence, red narrows identity) and charge final drying image; sensory acoustic void pulses purposefully without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of pre-completion exorcism escalates via density (three silence loops force entity tension), agency in questions narrows options to Maren's realization with visible cost; meets 9+ test under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of assumptive vulnerability emerges organically from red spectrum collapse and silence build to resonant "assumed that I was empty" repricing without moralizing; final quiet reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with perceptual signature in silence texturing; dialogue subtextual ("questions are light") advances under pressure, rhythmic control peaks cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors cohere in peak ("rope coming undone") without muddle, propulsion aligns with silence escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of loop pedal exorcism and dimensional fraying transforms possession trope; silence/rhetoric risk heightens stakes inevitably to CR without gimmickry.</comment>
