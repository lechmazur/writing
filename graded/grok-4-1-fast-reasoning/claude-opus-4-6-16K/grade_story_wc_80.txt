<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied perfectly in "pressure against her sternum," driving micro-choices like copying the journal line without weeping; internal conflict of cataloging loss while feeling its braid compels earned endurance at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to journal discovery and CR closure ("the pavilion would go on almost remembering how to dance"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in predecessor's ignored warning reweighting her persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion as micro-setting constrains wading choices and note placement, charging final image where cupola catches unseen sky; sensory selection (headlamp flashes on gilt, warped parquet) reflects Maren's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cataloging losses tightens accumulatively via journal find, deepening knowledge of ignored warnings; agency in wresting pages forces endurance with felt cost of impermanence shaping final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absences emerges organically from artifacts braiding into structure, answered non-literally by final image of pavilion "almost remembering how to dance"; resonance reweights endurance amid loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("hushed blaze of ruin," "low fire") modulates rhythmically with intensity; stable third-limited POV with clean free indirect style heightens lyric pressure to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied syntax propels through scene (e.g., "She capped the inkwell" resolves cleanly); figurative language coherent and purposeful, passing read-aloud test without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned dance hall as site for archeology of dreams, with journal's "They will build it anyway, and it will be beautiful, and it will go" transforming erosion trope into inevitable endurance.</comment>
