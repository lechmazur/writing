<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through chanting's evolution from murmur to sonar, embodying defiance amid poverty; final integration of formula into cadence earns renunciation of hopelessness with felt career cost. Contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. defiance—act in cleaning beat. No flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival chant to mosaic reveal as cadence shift (CR closure), with starless night pressing then reconfigured as canvas—cost legible in "stubbornly, beautifully" manufacture. Orientation anchored by para 1. One tightening at diagram recognition suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming fortress constrains via overwhelming scent requiring filter, shapes tactics (wall scrub); recurring petals/flowers charge final image mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy fireworks-biased (chem ratios). Body/tool (arm as notebook) as micro-setting alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (formula to defy hopelessness) signaled para 2, tightens via hour-long reveal changing knowledge/options under accumulative lens; agency in sonar-chant/copy forecloses belief-need with career cost felt in "perpetually broke." Escalation coherent, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (manufacture light stubbornly) emerges from particulars like charcoal forearm copy; final image ("Maren walked, chanting, and carried her own") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting starless premise without moralizing. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in unnamed colors lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chem-filtered noticing ("angle of cobalt to copper"); rhythmic prose modulates from percussive chant to held-breath hush. Stable close third; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "petals drifting down like soft ammunition"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts despite lyric figuration—pattern-taught, coherent. Propulsion aligns with beats; closure image undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fireworks-mosaic quest transforms defiance trope via chem-diagram idiom; risk in solo textured accumulation heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable premise angle; no derivatives.</comment>
