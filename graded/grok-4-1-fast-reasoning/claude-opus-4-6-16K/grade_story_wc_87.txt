<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in flickering faith moments versus persistent strokes; embodied grief peaks perfectly in "weeping and smiling simultaneously," earning renunciation of unworthiness with visible emotional cost. Interiority particular to navigator's lens avoids stock phrasing. Micro-choices like deliberate strokes reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via pole-by-pole progression and stroke-regret linkages to CR closure. Orientation anchored early at kayak launch. Cost legible in "particular grief of someone returning," reweighting self-forgiveness with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Utility poles and compass constrain choices (navigation method) and charge final image ("second pulse"); fog sensory narrowing mirrors urgency. POV-filtered details like "barnacled waterline" feel lived-in, guiding motion without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (realign with sea/self) signaled early via letter; accumulative escalation via flickering faith and emerging poles narrows doubt options. Agency in endurance paddling forecloses unworthiness path; cost felt in tears, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from strokes-as-regrets and poles-as-small-trusts; final image ("stroke after stroke, light after ordinary light") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting grand vs. humble navigation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with navigator's perceptual signature (celestial dial, pole lights); rhythmic modulation accelerates with strokes, breathes in reflection. Voice texture nautical and textured, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops despite "seven years" echo (purposeful pattern). Minor register elevation in abstractions ("alignment... practice") slightly drifts but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial failure to humble pole-navigation transforms redemption trope; utility poles as "small, visible, reachable points" inflects ingenuity, risking quiet closure that heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
