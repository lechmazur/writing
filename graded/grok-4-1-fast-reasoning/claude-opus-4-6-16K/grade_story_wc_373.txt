<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "capture the sound of trust breaking" is concretely embodied in her micro-choices like turning the fob and false starts, revealing steadfastness without epiphany. Harlan's unraveling in the final confrontation earns her renunciation of violence through prior causality. Contradictory impulses surface subtly in her "stranger" want versus expected revenge, complicating with genuine cost in presence alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: false starts build density toward Charged Poise closure in Harlan's silent recognition and "Elara" whisper, with cost in his "collapsing" voice. Single scene anchors orientation early (market entry by ~100 words). No causality breaks; watch fob constraint shapes every tactic to legible before/after reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pirate market's rot, algae, lantern light, and whispers constrain tactics (hush truce forces lures) and charge final climb image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities: fob gleams amid stalls. Rot motif mirrors theme without overt symbolism, evolving with pale sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust break) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via false starts tightening options until Harlan confrontation forecloses revenge path. Agency in presence/method yields visible cost: Harlan's unraveling sags structure. Sunrise pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silent betrayal emerges from watch fob reprises and hush truce, reweighting loyalty via final "hollow click" image without moralizing. Subtext in Harlan's mouth "opened. Closed. Opened again" offers resonant answer to trust's rot. Complexity lingers in her thwarting satisfaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature: bayou idioms ("river's mood") bias noticing. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Elara" cracks hush). Rhythm modulates from unhurried stalls to deepened personal silence at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines like "trust doesn't break loudly. It breaks the way wood rots" propel via image without loops or scaffolds. Varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with pressure; no figurative muddle or register drift. Final line recharges pier rot motif propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: revenge as auditory capture in hush market transforms betrayal trope via fob's silent click. Risk in non-violent thwart heightens stakes organically. Particular bayou-pirate details feel inevitable, no derivative echoes.</comment>
