<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (tried to throw/love pendant, now proffer it) with embodied emotion (golden bruise against sternum), earning final renunciation via prior cultivation; no therapy-speak flattens peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure ("She chose instead to proffer it"); cost legible in "no longer sharp, no longer solely hers"; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (nests pendant in icicle's "pale, branching lines") and charges final image (moss over amber); sensory details (velvet moss, drip rhythm) mirror internal thaw purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft meaning onto wounds) deepens accumulatively via micro-choices (trailing moss to placing pendant), foreclosing loyalty path with felt emotional cost; agency in renunciation tightens options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image (pendant as seed in pattern) offers resonant, non-literal answer to vulnerability-as-soil without moralizing; theme emerges organically from particulars like moss circuitry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light pooled in corners, moss as living circuitry) with rhythmic control under reflective pressure; stable close third-person POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short drip beats amid lyric swells); no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful (icicle as "nervous system"); propels to closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data ruin into fertile cathedral transforms trauma trope via specific images (server racks as moss circuits); risk in lyric closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
