<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Esme's motivation to cultivate estrangement roots deeply in her backstory cue of 22 years above ground, compelling micro-choices like keeping callers talking; interiority shines in "she would teach endings how to begin," earning her spiral realization without epiphany shortcuts. Contradictory endurance of isolation versus connection plays out embodied in the tunnel niche. Final renunciation of surfacing forecloses her old life with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from caller vignettes to disc's haunting note, culminating in CR closure where "one degree...turned grief into curiosity" reconfigures the premise of mistakes into spirals with estrangement's conceptual cost legible in "She never climbed back up." Orientation anchors immediately in Tunnel 7-C. No causality breaks; vignette elisions motivate via pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel's steam pipes, drip-water, and lamp buzz constrain Esme's niche existence and amplify the disc's note into haunting acoustics, charging the final image of pipes singing. Sensory hierarchy (hum margins, trembling ovals) filters through her operator lens. Micro-setting disc mirrors internal shift from loop to spiral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming wrong-number endings escalates accumulatively via disc's pitch-shifting note, reweighting repetition into spiral with agency in nurturing (e.g., Gerald volunteers); cost legibility peaks in "She never gave them her real name. She never climbed back up," foreclosing return. One tightening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of endings spiraling into beginnings emerges organically from caller transformations and disc's "trembling pulse of a beginning," offering non-literal resonance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "Stay" greeting. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of middle-to-end shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "throat that had swallowed its own echo" and biased noticing of acoustic margins; rhythmic control modulates from descriptive builds to charged poise in final lines. Stable third-limited POV; no dialogue to judge, but implied caller exchanges carry subtext via summaries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "the switching architecture...caught their mistakes like a web catches moths"; varied syntax propels from hum swells to spiral revelation without loops or muddled metaphors. Final line recharges "wrong number" motif crisply; flawless read-aloud rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgotten switchboard as wrong-number therapy web, transformed by glass disc's haunting into spiral epiphany; risk in lyrical accumulative structure heightens isolation stakes without gimmick. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight from nightshade cultivation onward.</comment>
