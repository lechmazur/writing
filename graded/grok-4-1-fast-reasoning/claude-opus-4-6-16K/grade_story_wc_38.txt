<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in inherited cipher legacy compel the deletion choice; realization "settled into her chest like a stone finding the seabed" anchors emotional cost without epiphany shortcuts, though contradictory impulses act mildly in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rhythmic discoveries building to Charged Poise closure; deletion "drives hissed and went dark" with lab "exhale" delivers legible emotional/conceptual cost of release, oriented early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken lab's biolum algae, salt-furred walls, and geothermal console constrain dances and deletion; body/dance as micro-setting charges final image, sensory details filtered through Maren's code-hearing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fulfilling mother's ciphered love tightens accumulatively through journal confession to deletion agency; dice rolls and dance entries escalate with narrowing options, cost felt in operatives' release and personal completion.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability encrypted as unbreakable strength emerges organically from journal confessions and deletion; final dice-in-palm image reconfigures mother-daughter bond with resonant, non-literal cost of letting go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature of rhythms/meters in decay and codes; diction modulates gracefully under emotional pressure, purposeful elision taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose propels with varied syntax suiting accumulative texture; figurative density purposeful and pattern-taught (e.g., "singing it loose"), no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-as-cipher, hangman's dice randomizers, and oceanic familiarity transforms tropes into inevitable mother-daughter communion; risk-taking in lyric code-breaking heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
