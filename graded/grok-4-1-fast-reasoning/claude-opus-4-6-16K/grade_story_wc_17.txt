<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied sensitivity as curse/gift drives micro-choices like palm-on-stone listening; legacy pivot at diary discovery earns final publication resolve with inheritance cost over family suppression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as acoustic density builds to CR closure; crumbled brick discovery causally yields diaries/negatives, enabling spoken commitment answered by non-echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage constrains via breath/hum/tremble, charging final image; sensory filter (salt air, damp stone) mirrors perceptual bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake tightens from structural mapping to legacy proof via diary glimpse, foreclosing suppression path; endurance agency in speaking carries felt burden cost under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vinyl-memory theory emerges via particulars, reweighted in final echo response as collective signal; resonant without moralizing or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with acoustic perceptual signature ("slow exhalation," "deeper hum"); rhythm compresses to charged poise at "something...answered her back."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density propels via varied syntax; "ivy trembled in a draft that came from nowhere" delivers flawless closure propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh "stone as vinyl" synthesis transforms echo trope; bold wall-speaking risk pays in echo answer, inevitable from acoustic buildup.</comment>
