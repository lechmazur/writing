<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sera's luminous skepticism creates embodied contradiction—she steals amber yet climbs despite refusing "pilgrim," culminating in earned realization that forecloses doubt with felt cost. Micro-choices like following footprints and placing amber reveal value hierarchy under internal pressure. No diagnostic labels; flaws deepen organically without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to CR closure: "Sera...closed her eyes and felt, for the first time, home" reweights skepticism with conceptual cost of yielding. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (Sera, tower, amber, signal). Single scene/shard fits defaults; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tower, path, and amber micro-setting constrain climb and charge final image—basin pool "held the sky's reflection with a bronze quiet," mirroring internal suspension. Sensory details (spring light, moss, thistle) filter through Sera's priorities, evolving with ascent. Specificity lived-in; no generics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. homecoming pull) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through reflective beats to CR reconfiguration, narrowing doubt via convergence pressure. Agency in placing amber crystallizes stance with undeniable emotional cost. One tightening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of manufactured meaning becoming real emerges implicitly via amber-fly motif shifting from theft to homecoming symbol, reweighting artificial pilgrimage without statement. Final image offers non-literal answer: suspension ends in felt "home." Complexity lingers in skeptic's yield.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature—doubt "shone so brightly it attracted...moths"—modulates rhythmically, stable single POV. Syntax reflects skeptical deepening; no filter excess or leakage. Compression purposeful, taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language coherent (light "like something remembering how to speak"). Peak closure image clear, propelled. Read-aloud flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alien coordinates graft meaning onto mundane sites, transformed via amber suspension parallel; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative form heightens stakes. No templates; inevitability in skeptic's convergence.</comment>
