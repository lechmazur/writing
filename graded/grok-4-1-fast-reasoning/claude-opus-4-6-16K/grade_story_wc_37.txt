<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's scattered memories embodied concretely ("slipped through her mind like water through a sieve") drive micro-choices (hands weave despite forgotten mind) to earned reversal at closure (memories knitting with notes). Internal conflict simultaneous (mind thins, body sings). Minor slip: "remembered now" epiphany borders unearned, but ties to prior sensory cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from scattered fragments to woven panel, song intensification, light bleed as RR closure with cost (cracked voice, wept). Orientation anchored early (Elara in dying orchard, endless night). Single scene coherent, pattern taught via weaving motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mica window and glowing fruits constrain choices (pulp threads, swaddle site) and charge final image (light bleeds outward). Sensory vivid/POV-filtered (ghost-taste fruit, sap like cold honey). Atmosphere tensions dying world against warm glow reversal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle dying realm via memory/song) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: window trembles → warmer glow → voices join, narrowing to agency-driven release. Cost legible (wept, cracked voice holds). One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in realm-mind link viscerally felt at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (songs knit connections/realm) emerges organically from song lyrics (neighbors in gold dawn) and closure voices rising. Final image reweights isolation to communal memory without moral. Resonant non-literal answer via light promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct (perceptual signature: "light had forgotten its own name"), stable third-limited POV, rhythm modulates (short urgent sentences at "sang louder"). Compression purposeful, pattern-taught; fits accumulative lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud pulses with song rise); no loops/artifacts. Figures coherent/purposeful ("condensed twilight") propel without muddle. Propulsion peaks clean at "light began to bleed outward."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical orchard + woven dawns + songs as tissue transforms fantasy tropes via memory-body split. Risky lyric fantasy heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from early scattered premise.</comment>
