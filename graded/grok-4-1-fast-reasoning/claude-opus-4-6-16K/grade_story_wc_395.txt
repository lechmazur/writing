<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through concrete perceptual bias ("feel the texture of data the way a jeweler feels the weight of a stone"), with motivation intensifying via pattern discoveries to compel the final leak; contradictory impulses evident in not confronting Desmond despite knowing his lie. Final renunciation of loyalty earned by prior digs. Minor reflection summary slightly abstracts peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup of 7-22 pattern narrowing knowledge to hidden partition and unsent messages; CR closure lands on-page in "She pressed send" and charged ghosts image, reweighting archive's silence with conceptual cost of exposure. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hum ("frequencies that reminded Lena Voss of songs") and data texture filter through POV, constraining choices via access to partitions; recurring archive subtly mirrors internal absence. Patch in profiles charges discoveries without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hidden data truths) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pattern revelations and boss denial forcing deeper isolation; agency in copying/sending forecloses career path with felt exposure cost in final ghosts' breath. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of persistent digital memory emerges organically from pattern particulars and unsent messages, reweighted in CR ending where data's "heartbeat" and ghosts charge silence without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in archive's expectant hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in data-as-song metaphors and metadata pulses sustains third-limited stability; rhythmic modulation builds under discovery pressure ("tapping on the glass between data and consciousness"). Brief dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "7-22 appeared in server rack temperatures, in her daily calorie count"); varied rhythm propels without loops or artifacts, culminating in crisp final image. No overwriting in peak reveals.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive forensics hiding corporate spaceship secret via numerical "count" of missing persons transforms conspiracy tropes; Site 722 twist inevitable from pattern, with bold data-haunting risk heightening closure.</comment>
