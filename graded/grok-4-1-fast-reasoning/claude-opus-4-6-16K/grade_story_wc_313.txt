<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's "precisely humane" trait channels emotion into action like mounting photos, earning her shift from warden to curator with micro-choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses show in precise study vs. felt chest shift, embodied without labels. Final endurance of silence forecloses replacement with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chime silence to resurfacing to photo trail, tightening to Charged Poise closure in "rooftops... holding what remained," reconfiguring memory with conceptual cost of reckoning. Orientation anchored early (Maren, ridge station, evening). One meaningful deepening via photo discovery pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mud "releas[ing] each footstep with a sound like whispered apology" integrates tactile setting into action; ridge trail constrains exhibition choice and charges final "open hands" image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's vigilance; no white-room, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurfacing vs. expunged memory) signaled early, accumulates density to exhibition stance crystallization; photo jar deepens knowledge, narrowing to action with county-reckoning cost felt in unchallenged mounting. Agency in curation forecloses passive monitoring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of swallowed narratives emerges via particulars like "reservoir holds... narrative," resonating in final image repricing ridge-town gaze without moralizing. Subtext in photo captions invites reckoning; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("twilight that pooled... like something poured") stable in single POV; diction/rhythm modulate from hush to emergence, heightening pressure without elision issues. Texture distinct, biased to Maren's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., short punchy mud steps amid lyrical pools); no loops, metaphors coherent and purposeful like "spines of drowned animals." Propulsion weaves image/action seamlessly to charged end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resurfacing town + photo trail transforms drowned-village trope via inverted gaze and exhibition risk; fresh synthesis of vigilance/memory feels inevitable, with bold lyric hush charging closure without gimmick.</comment>
