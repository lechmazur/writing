<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via bloodline's "counterclockwise pull," embodied in cold as "second skeleton"; micro-choices like placing acorn cap reveal values under pressure. Final endurance of "granular" time earns change with felt cost of split-seed stillness. Contradictory impulses subtle in shifting acorn cap understanding from literal to measurement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: egg hatch motivates reopening, density builds to ice clarification and seed reveal as RR/Charged Poise. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Maren at door, atrium sealed 11 years). Closure cost legible in "texture of borrowed time" realization and acorn cap's starlight drop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound atrium and starlight constrain choice (ice reorganizes under focus), body as "second skeleton" mirrors internal state. Acorn cap as micro-setting charges final image when filled and drunk. Sensory selection purposeful: "frost-rimed latch," "pale blues and silvers."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse entropy via inheritance) signaled early, deepens via ice thinning to reveal seeds under Accumulative lens. Agency in sustained attention forecloses chaos path; cost felt in granular "potential" and split-seed tension. One tightening sufficient, charges closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of dormancy as "patience compressed" emerges from seed/ice/egg particulars, reweighted in final "wild serenity of continuation." Resonant image of rustling hatchling answers entropy question without moral. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in unseen trusted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature ("vortex inheritance" as thermodynamic pull); rhythm modulates from anticipatory to propelled in entropy decrease. Stable single POV, no elision issues; diction biased to seeds ("viable... holding... compressed time").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., "furious tranquility" does dual jobs); rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in focus beat). Metaphors coherent ("fist clenched... perfect stillness"); propulsion peaks in ice reorganization without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Thermodynamic inheritance transforms seed-saving trope into fresh entropy reversal; synthesis inevitable in spiral patterns and starlight drop. Bold risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
