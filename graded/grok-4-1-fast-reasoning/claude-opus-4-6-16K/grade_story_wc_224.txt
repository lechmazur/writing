<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (bury talents vs. seer pull) embodied in "mercury in her eyes stirred"; final renunciation of substitution earned by gradual pressure, foreclosing escapist path with felt ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from reflective shards to closure; Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "she let the world arrive as it was... shape of home — not restored, but finally legible," with cost of dissolving visions legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore constrains search ("routes between sections had replaced... memories") and charges final image as internal structure; sensory details like "air tasted of iron" filter through seer bias, mirroring grief's corridors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover home syntax) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via inert stone to feather-deepening that reweights knowledge; cost unmistakable in ending's acceptance of ache over substitution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of home as syntax emerges implicitly from stone/language images, reweighted non-literally in final corridor realization without moralizing; resonance inextricable from arc, lingering via ambiguity of "legible" restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with seer-specific perceptual signature ("futures pooling in rain puddles"); rhythmic control modulates from calm shelving to peak "weeping... shaking foundations," no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("Via the texture of that feather... inscriptions became sound" packs revelation); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (seed/soil) without muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer/bookstore/language stone transforms trope of lost artifact into syntax-home; feather activation risks lyric compression that heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
