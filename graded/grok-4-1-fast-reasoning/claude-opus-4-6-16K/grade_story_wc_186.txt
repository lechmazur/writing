<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied retrocognition ("pressure of prior moments leaning against her skull") and micro-choices like charting fractured rainbows, earning closure's faithful act; contradictory impulses in stubborn rituals vs. potential failure act simultaneously without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density from pavilion mappings to prism-star alignment, delivering Charged Poise closure in "twin beams lanced into the dark" where fracture reconfigures light with conceptual cost of refusing chaos; orientation anchored early, one tightening via tonight's precise angle suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pavilion's hum constrains choices ("mapped which panes hummed") and charges final image ("every pane sang at once"); sensory hierarchy (teeth ache, chest hollowed) reflects POV urgency, evolving causally with temperature drop and light sweep.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove meaning tightens accumulatively via star-pavilion correlations narrowing to prism alignment choice; agency in fitting broken prism despite known flaws forecloses clean focus path, with visible cost in fractured but transformative light charging trader's turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of intention in accidents emerges organically from prism visions linking lens-maker to Maren, resonant in final "thistle-blown, stubborn" hope image reweighting collapse as "sentence in a longer story" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("incomplete arcs that overlapped in patterns") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm under insight pressure; purposeful compression of backstory anchors to present cues like prism touch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The cities had burned in their own electrical fevers"); no loops, figurative coherence builds to shivering closure chord without muddle in peak lighting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse custodian proving cosmic grammar via retrocognition and tuned pavilion transforms beacon trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive to quiet Charged Poise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
