<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between narration and silence act in scene, earning the final silent carving as endurance with ambiguity cost; blankness as resistance revealed through micro-choices like inspecting wood. Interiority concrete and particular, no epiphanies. Flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from narration/whittling to silent petal-carving Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "no legislation on earth could fill what it chose to hold open," reconfiguring blankness. Orientation anchored early (farmhouse/turbines/Maren). Single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Turbines' shadows constrain mood and choices, mirroring internal rotation in "shadows that moved across the walls in slow rotation"; bouquet as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (gray light, pine curls). Vivid, purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief via resistance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to silent whittling that crystallizes stance; agency in endurance forecloses overt grief with ambiguity cost. One tightening via narration-to-silence shift narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of silent carving offers resonant non-literal answer to mandated happiness vs authentic hush, reweighting blankness/motifs without moral; theme emerges organically from particulars like bouquet carving. No preaching, complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (exaggerated narration gravity) and rhythmic control modulate from dramatic to silent close; stable close-third POV, no leakage. Compression taught early, pays off in hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied rhythm accelerates in whittling silence; no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (turbines/shadows). Minor figurative density purposeful, no muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh dystopian angle via blankness/narration as subversion; whittled flower synthesis inevitable from grief/stake, risk in quiet stasis heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
