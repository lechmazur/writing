<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Margit's reticence and observant nature drive consistent micro-choices like pocketing sea glass and adding her page, with contradictory impulses (silence vs. voice) culminating in earned realization during lantern room climb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via stone patterns building to letter chain discovery; closure as CR in her 12-word addition reweights her role with felt cost of exceeded reticence, legible in sea glass placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lantern room's haunted weight and matchlight constrain relighting choice and charge chain reading; sea glass and Atlantic breath filter through her priorities, evolving with crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bottling safety tightens via lamp outage and chain discovery, forcing stance crystallization in page addition; cost felt in Hallgrimsson's injury and her breached word limit, under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared light/safety emerges via particulars like cairns-to-chain; final image of her words and stones offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting silence as aflame quietude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable with selective perceptual signature (reading silences like cairns); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, as in matchlit chain reading evoking luminescent ache.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via purposeful figuratives (e.g., "braid of unsigned confessions"); no loops or artifacts, opening line anchors stakes flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cairns evolving to letter chain transforms isolation trope; risk in reticent protag's subtle voice-risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
