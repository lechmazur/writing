<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zen potter's embodied hands (reading wood grain like clay) reveal consistent traits and micro-choices under pressure; final commitment to kiln earned by causal build from doubt to body-knowledge thrum. Contradictory impulses (logic vs. instinct) act simultaneously without tidy epiphany. No flaws touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers from arrival to light bands revealing timelines, culminating in CR closure where kindness anchors oasis with conceptual cost of sustained care. Orientation anchored early (nine days to oasis). No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "keep the reason alive."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Oasis micro-setting (hive box, lavender, acacia) constrains kiln plan and charges final image (ground warms under hands). Sensory hierarchy (mineral smell, thrum vibration) filtered through potter bias; evolves causally with evening smoke. Recurring wood grain mirrors internal centering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why places resist) signaled early, deepens texturally via lens patterns/plants turning; agency in following sun/press hands forecloses doubt path with cost of indefinite stay. One tightening sufficient under lens; moral calculus (kindness vs. logic) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (kindness anchors timelines) emerges organically from particulars (phototropic plants, soaked soil); final image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing—"sharply gentle" press answers question with lingering ambiguity of endurance cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (potter's centering, timeline lens koan) with rhythmic modulation (short thrum sentences under intensity); purposeful compression in light bands taught early, pays off legible. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "split the sun into overlapping bands"); varied rhythm accelerates to thrum peak without loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (fractured light as timelines). Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: timelines bent by "phototropic to kindness" via beekeeping/pottery transforms post-apoc trope; risk in abstract physics grounded specifically (lens on hive), inevitable hindsight from early question. No derivatives.</comment>
