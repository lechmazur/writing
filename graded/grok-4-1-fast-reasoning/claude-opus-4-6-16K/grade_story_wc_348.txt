<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via chemist/symphonic lens, embodied grief ("load-bearing" to "loosen another degree") shows contradictory impulses acting in foam/chrysalis beats; final atonement choice earned by causal buildup with visible emotional cost in chest loosening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations (foam, chrysalis) build density to CR closure where divergence reconfigures as reconvergent topology; cost legible in "grief in her chest loosen another degree" and commitment to write.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ravine/foam patterns filter through POV bias, constrain choices (upstream walk to birch), charge final image ("ravine sang behind her"); micro-objects (chrysalis cupped, placed) evolve causally as setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile post-silence) signaled by letter, deepens via foam insight to chrysalis for one decisive cadence shift narrowing isolation path; cost felt in embodied grief shift charging climb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from polymer/river particulars to resonant CR ("braids could reconverge miles downstream"); final image reweights divergence without moralizing, lingering ambiguity on reconnection viability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (symphonic/chemical noticing); rhythmic control modulates insight ("snagged... vibration, a harmonic"); purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively without loops; metaphors cohere (polymer/river) in peak insight beat, no scaffold obscuring chrysalis image or final climb propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer chemistry, Mahler, braided topology transforms reconciliation trope; chrysalis/foam risks heighten stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at "streams reconverge" reconfiguration.</comment>
