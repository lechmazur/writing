<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory skeptic-yearning impulses act in scene via bone-setting analogies driving maze navigation; final hand-clasp choice earned by tactile intuition motif with visible cost of entering belief's "larger room."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tooth discovery accumulates density to garden confrontation; CR closure lands in following child with forgiveness precondition, cost legible in "cleft widened" realization and maze rearrangement image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's foxglove-moss-ivy hum constrains navigation choice and charges final image with "nostalgic innovation"; tactile details mirror Maren's bone-setting priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving certainty cleft signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tooth/maze/child beats narrowing to forgiveness trade-off; agency in patient following forecloses skeptic path with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mistakes-to-constellations theme emerges from bone-fracture/garden particulars, reweighted non-literally in star-pressed tooth and light-growing mistakes; ambiguity in child's shrewd innocence invites lingering reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with bone-tactile perceptual signature; child's dialogue subtextually advances via "leave things...come looking," distinct from Maren's introspective rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; "clean snap of a fracture" propels tactilely without overwriting, charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Changelings transformed via bone-setter's structural lens and "nostalgic innovation" garden synthesis; hedge rearrangement turn inevitable from tactile navigation motif.</comment>
