<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Defiant artist motivation intensifies compellingly to poetry improvisation under ritual pressure, with embodied defiance ("hardens behind her sternum") and micro-choices in call-response revealing values; earned stasis in waiting for noon forecloses memory with cost. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echo density builds testimony, tightening to CR closure ("You cannot absolve a canyon") reconfiguring erasure options with conceptual cost legible in final echoes image; single scene anchored early, pattern taught via first poem.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and transforming echoes constrain poetry tactics and charge final recursive image; sensory hierarchy (sound-dominant, mist visual) filtered through artist's urgency, evolving causally as echoes fill air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via refracting poems narrowing Synod options; agency in endurance forecloses memory path with on-page cost crystallized in priest confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pluralized truth vs. amputative forgiveness emerges organically from echo events and canyon image; final reconfiguration ("canyon would remember for her") non-literally answers without moralizing, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (artist's acoustic bias); voice rhythmic and modulated, dialogue subtextual ("changes everything") pursuing goals; diction controlled, eliding ritual details paid off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated sensory propulsion; opening metaphors vivid without muddle, minor figurative density in setup doesn't obscure; no loops, clean syntax supports echo cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of acoustic canyon and poetry transforms trope of silenced truth into plural immortality; risk in echo refraction feels inevitable from setup, heightening stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
