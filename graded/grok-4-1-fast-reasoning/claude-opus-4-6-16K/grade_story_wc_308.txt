<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and endurance in stillness, with micro-choices like striking the arrowhead revealing hierarchy of values; interiority concrete via teeth ache and birds landing, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; Charged Poise closure in "the canyon unfold inside her" with stillness cost legible in "had not moved in weeks"; orientation anchored immediately in canyon and towers; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and swifts constrain choices (striking bone, reading flocks as diagrams) and charge final compass rose image; sensory hierarchy acoustic/visual via POV bias; selective dust and echoes integrate into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolate pulse) signaled early tightens accumulatively from sound interference to bird patterns to timed wait; agency in endurance forecloses chasing path with weeks-long stillness cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening to past without possessing emerges organically from particulars; final "let it go" image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "not meant to be caught, only understood" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (flocks as "sentences," echoes aged); rhythmic control modulates from repetitive striking to crystalline revelation; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; rhythm varies naturally (short strikes building to expansive unfold); figurative precision like "compass rose drawn in feathers" propels without muddle in peak reception beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of acoustic archaeology, bird murmurations as maps, and stillness-navigation transforms tropes into inevitable fresh premise; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
