<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's skeptical interiority cracks via embodied grief during frost reorganization, earning the final notebook "truthful lie" with contradictory impulses acting on-page. Sera's grounded traits compel witness need without preachiness. Final renunciation of dismissal forecloses prior stance with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup to frost patterns and grief intrusion delivers Conceptual Repricing in notebook entry, reweighting premise that "objects hold nothing" with unbearable cost of saturated world. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt. Closure image of mist as "secret kept in plain sight" pays off hush shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and Volvo frost constrain experiment and charge climax, with ice "reorganizing" mirroring emotional absorption. Sensory hierarchy (fog-swallowed sun, feathered crystals) reflects narrator's skepticism yielding to grief. Evolves causally to "randomness" post-prism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. proof) deepens via frost spirals evoking Lily's grief, forcing internal reconfiguration under Accumulative lens. Agency in witnessing forecloses dismissal, with cost in "sorrow so specific... lived there now." One tightening sufficient, charges final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of emotional residue emerges via prism/frost, culminating in resonant CR: notebook lie reweights "silence" as overlooked sorrow without moralizing. Subtext in "most honest woman... right truth" and final image embraces ambiguity of listening world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct first-person voice with skeptical perceptual bias ("thermodynamics... explicable physics") modulates to grief vulnerability. Stable POV, rhythmic syntax heightens hush shift ("quiet that listened back"). Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Come see the car").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences at frost move: "The frost moved. Not melting. Reorganizing."). No loops, metaphors coherent (grief "crack open like an eggshell"). Propulsion peaks at climax without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional object-absorption via frost/prism physics transforms mystic trope through grounded data/papers. Risky CR closure ("Everything we have ever touched remembers") feels inevitable, heightened by irreplaceable quartz-frost communion.</comment>
