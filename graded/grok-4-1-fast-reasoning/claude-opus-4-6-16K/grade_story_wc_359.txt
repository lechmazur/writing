<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority embodied in specific perceptions like "every silence wore a shade of blue so deep it bruised"; final unfettering earned by prior responsibility weight mistaken for heartbeat, with micro-choices in strikes revealing values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as strikes braid colors into aurora; closure as RR/CR in white tone joining sky aurora, cost legible in "tightness... unfetter" chest release; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice columns constrain strikes and charge final resonance; sensory hierarchy via synesthesia (sound-to-color, coral smelling of cedar) mirrors internal shift, evolving with events to full hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fulfill sheet/ responsibility signaled early, tightens accumulatively per lens through blank measure deepening; agency in improvised final strike forecloses doubt with emotional cost unfettered on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's structural role emerges from aurora dome proving "beauty mattered"; final blue note image reweights premise non-literally, with lingering ambiguity in carried proof.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("ribbon of green-gold light") distinct and biased; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without slips, POV stable in embodied noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives like "insects trapped in honey" integrated into action; varied rhythm propels to closure image without loops or muddle in peak strikes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, fossilized notation self-completing via ice resonance transforms trope of hidden cavern; chisel memory inflects non-obviously into proof's origin.</comment>
