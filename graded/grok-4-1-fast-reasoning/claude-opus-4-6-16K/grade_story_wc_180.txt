<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in inheritance and stubbornness compels micro-choices like using the ribbon and opening the bag; Elsa applies relevant pressure as crucible. Interiority concrete and embodied in squinting over the eye. Minor label "endearingly feisty" trends toward telling without tradeoff visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon aids clarity therefore recalls technique, therefore opens bag revealing pre-patent proof, tightening to Charged Poise closure in teaching Elsa. Orientation anchored by para 1. Cost legible in persistent exile amid ripening apples.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cathedral orchard integrates purposefully—cracked marble roots constrain tools (no loupes), dusty light through rose windows charges final polishing image. Sensory hierarchy via Maren's professional gaze; body/tool (quartz eye, ribbon) constrain choices. POV bias filters familiarity without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Syndicate seizure vs. persistence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via bag discovery narrowing to free knowledge claim. Agency in unpacking and teaching forecloses descent path with exile cost. One tightening sufficient; Elsa's pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Generational knowledge enduring beyond contracts emerges organically from ribbon recall to diagrams to teaching; "deciduous vow" metaphor reweights premise in final image without statement. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity in Syndicate fight lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Maren with perceptual signature (craft details like mineral grain). Dialogue natural, subtextual ("Stubbornness is cheaper"), distinct voices (Elsa feisty-practical vs. Maren's reflective). Rhythmic control modulates from tense mending to poised closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "silk dampens the vibration" advances craft and memory). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative purposeful (roots threading marble mirrors knowledge persistence). Propulsion peaks in bag spread without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quartz prosthetics, patent breach, cathedral orchard transforms IP trope into generational endurance. Risky orchard setting heightens isolation stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: bag as "accidental evidence" feels earned, non-obvious.</comment>
