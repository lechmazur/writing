<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of freedom-as-trap embodied in cellular twin-presence drive micro-choices to garden; final naming earns reconfiguration with warmth-cost behind ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: clue density converges on garden RR (Charged Poise/CR), ship's pause/fog-thinning legible cost reweights entrapment; single-shard coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Impossible greenhouse/tags constrain search, roots-mural hides door pivotal; final jasmine vine charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (name-recovery) deepens via memory/architecture shifts narrowing to door; persistent trap-cost felt in final breath, agency in persistent seeking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Unkindled solace reconfigures via match-ignition image, resonant non-literal answer to twin-identity without moral; emerges organically from chimerism particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (fog/memory-bending) with rhythmic modulation; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density/varied rhythm propel without loops; opening metaphor clusters purposeful for textural lens, no muddle at peak garden beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chimera-garden-ship synthesis transforms vanishing twin trope via surreal cellular/narrative logic; closure risk (poetic stasis) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
