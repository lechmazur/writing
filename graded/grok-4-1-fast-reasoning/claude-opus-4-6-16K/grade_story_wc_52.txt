<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and micro-choices under grief's pressure, with carving strokes revealing practical endurance rooted in Theodor's lion lessons. Contradictory here/gone memories act simultaneously without summary. Final vessel realization earned by prior containment causality, foreclosing drowning with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly in single continuous scene; kettle incites carving that accumulates density to CR closure where final tea/steam image reconfigures grief as rhythm with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Arles loft, October, widow). No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (rain-freckled skylight, lanolin/sawdust ghost smells) filter through widow's bias, constraining carving rite and charging final rust-hued lion image. Loft relics (whip, boots) mirror internal state purposefully without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (ash blank, knife) evolves to guide closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain grief vs. drown) signaled early, escalates texturally via thickening resin-minutes and memory density that forces endurance agency. Cadence shift at kettle scream narrows to Charged Poise with legible cost in accepted absence. Single tightening sufficient and protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of containment/here-gone rhythm emerges organically from carving particulars, reweighted in final lion/tea image without moralizing. Subtext in reliquary fragments invites lingering ambiguity on survival's price. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (ghost senses, practical lens) modulates rhythmically under pressure. Prose texture (curl falls, resin thickens) reflects widow's mind without filter excess or leakage. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; rhythm varies (short practical strokes amid lyric swells) propels accumulatively. Figurative language (constellation droplets, amber resin) coherent, pattern-taught, never muddles peak carving beat. Final line recharges motifs propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-taming containment applied to grief-carving transforms widow trope via Arles circus specificity and ash lion emergence. Risky textural rite heightens stakes organically. Hindsight inevitability in rhythm realization from practical strokes.</comment>
