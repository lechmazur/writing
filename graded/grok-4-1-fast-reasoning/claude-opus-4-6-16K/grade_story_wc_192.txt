<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses culminate in earned renunciation of the shadow-keeper role, with the ring placement as a micro-choice revealing values hierarchy and visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to Charged Poise closure in final shadow image ("unmistakably and only hers"), with felt cost of foreclosed identity legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ash pillars and encroaching stars as micro-setting constrain boundary-less release and charge final shadow image, with sensory selection (charcoal taste, scar heat) perfectly biased to POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-breathing tightens via textural cadence shift in encroaching stars and ring removal, forcing renunciation with on-page cost of dissolved keeper role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of threshold dissolution emerges organically from fire/ash/scars particulars, with final "enough" image as resonant reconfiguration reweighting prior absorption without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scar-linking, ash-taste) and rhythmic modulation (short breaths at climax) sustain close single-POV under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density with varied rhythm propels to closure, as in "The threshold faded completely" line blending image and propulsion flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadow-keeper premise synthesizes fresh emotional specificity through scar/ring/ash crucible, with lyric risk paying off in inevitable "enough" reconfiguration.</comment>
