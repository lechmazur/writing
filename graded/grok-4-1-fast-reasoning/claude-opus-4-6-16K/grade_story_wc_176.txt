<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("stone in her sternum," "bronze dust on her palms"); past failure compels present micro-choices in reconfiguration, earning thaw as earned stasis with visible cost of prior grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from descent and reconfiguration to illumination as charged poise closure; cost legible in "whispered the first name," reconfiguring eleven-year silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice veins bending aurora and stiff fibers constrain gentle reconfiguration; final spectral threads charge closure image, filtering through POV's caster priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) signaled early, deepens via rope resistance yielding to prismatic lattice; agency in braid translation forecloses erasure path with felt thaw cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Paradox of preservation-through-loss emerges from lost-wax craft and card-to-rope translation; final whisper offers resonant non-literal answer to grief's erasure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ties to caster's worldview ("monument to its own vanished original"); stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation heightens illumination poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative lattice ("rivers know stone") propels without loops or muddle; rhythm varies to peak in "sanctum answered," charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of punched card pitches into rope braids as prismatic notation transforms preservation trope; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable light-encoded names.</comment>
