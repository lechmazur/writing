<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reluctant caretaker's hatred ("She hated the place. She stayed anyway") clashes with compulsive rescue, driving assembly despite shaking fingers; final endurance/renunciation of escape feels earned via inherited curse and partial success, balancing competence with frost-induced failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from family entry to frost-sealed thirteenth point, yielding Charged Poise closure in "turned back to her terrible, necessary trees" where incomplete network reconfigures her eternal duty with felt cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cliffside orchard/labrinyth with "roots clutching limestone like arthritic fingers" and frost "like white fingers closing" constrains choices (no-touch rule, timed activation) and charges final survival image; mechanical birds' glass eyes track her, mirroring watched isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save family pre-frost) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via heard cries nearing then fading at twelfth point; her agency in partial activation forces shouted finale, with legible cost of arms shaking and sealed points foreclosing full resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Burden of cursed duty emerges organically from stone fruit, singing walls, and her return; final line's "graceless beauty of survival" resonates as non-literal answer to endurance vs. escape, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature ("precision were an afterthought it happened to achieve"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in descent ("air tasted of coming ice"), no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("She threaded it with her teeth because her fingers were shaking from cold"); no loops/artifacts, concrete images like "skeletal hand holding a funnel" advance without overwriting, rhythm breathes with frost urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard yielding stone fruit, acoustic cruelty labyrinth, copper birds with "offhandedly exact" gears transforms tropes; risk in graceless functionalism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via blueprint's unbuilt potential.</comment>
