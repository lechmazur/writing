<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory skepticism acts via tasted evidence and obsessive cataloguing, earning final self-acceptance; grandmother parallel reveals inherited prickle without therapy-speak; micro-choice to wear ring and climb bluff forecloses denial with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tastes and spirals densify to CR closure ("needle... pointed directly at Maren"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; conceptual cost legible in self-realization image, reweighting premise without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory specifics (ozone/copper tongue, aurora pools, forest pulse) filter through skeptic's priorities, mirroring convergence; lavender/aurora constrain arrival and charge final flare/bend, evolving with needle stop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn why people carry weather) signaled early, deepens via layering tastes/spinning to self-revelation under Accumulative lens; agency in convergence observation forces stance crystallization; cost felt in foreclosed skepticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (weather as elected consciousness) emerges from forest/needle parallels to "weather had chosen them"; final snow-fall image resonantly reanswers question non-literally, reweighting skeptic's arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward atmospheric tastes; syntax/rhythm modulate from deliberate to charged ("She closed her eyes and let the snow she carried finally fall"); purposeful lyric compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (root ballots, needle spirals); minor figurative stack ("terrestrially cosmic") purposeful but borders coherence in reflective block; no loops, propulsion peaks at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-bodies as synapses transforms inheritance trope via taste-compass; risk-taking in "forests... chemical ballots" inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
