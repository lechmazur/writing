<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between rigid planning and embracing uncertainty act in scene via packing tools despite doubt and final tinkering choice; earned by pattern of discoveries with cost of forsaking predictability. Interiority particular to tinkerer mindset, embodied in mist-damp hands and gear analogies. No safety-hedging in her improvised commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clock anomalies build pattern to coordinates, greenhouse discovery, letter revelation tightening to Charged Poise closure where she tucks artifact and begins, reweighting stance with dense consequence felt in "no plan for this." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one meaningful deepening via letter suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Subterranean waterfall and mist constrain workshop life and soldering; swirling leaves in greenhouse charge discovery beat and mirror uncertainty. Sensory hierarchy (thunder swallows silence, papery edges catch fingers) reflects tinkerer's tactile priorities. Final bench image recharges waterfall roar and mist as collaborators.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pattern invitation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via letter exposing safe harbors' peril, forcing improvisation with moral cost legible in "dense with consequence." Agency in venturing and committing crystallizes stance; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mending hidden mechanisms emerges from clocks to compass sacrifice; final image of screwdriver amid roar offers resonant answer to planning-vs-uncertainty without moralizing. Particulars like oilcloth crumbling shift compass meaning organically. Counter-reading (isolation enables heroism) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tinkerer perceptual signature: mechanisms as metaphors, tactile bias in "spring tensioned to specification." Rhythmic prose modulates from patient catalog to urgent mist-kissed resolve; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mist kept her skin perpetually damp and her soldering iron perpetually difficult"); rhythm varies for propulsion, zero loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful and coherent in peaks like "papery edges... whispered warnings."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of treasure-hunt trope via broken clocks cipher in lived-in cave workshop; risk in quiet Charged Poise ending heightens ingenuity. Non-obvious pattern logic feels inevitable from Solenne's parallel sacrifice.</comment>
