<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and character-particular discipline in witnessing without judgment, embodied in gentle page-turning and burrowing; motivation intensifies via swan's folds to purest silence. Final renunciation of writing earns stasis with felt cost of carrying only memory. Minor lack: no overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal river scene, but endurance aligns with traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to river's regenerative form, CR closure in "wrote nothing" and folding swan reconfigures loss-to-potential with legible conceptual cost of impermanence in crumbling peace. Orientation anchors early (nameless keeper, catacombs); one tightening at deepest fold/river. Waiver: deliberate timeless disorientation pays off at reflective end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (roots threading spines, moss margins, black river's slowness) filtered through POV's textural priorities; obsidian refuge and swan constrain navigation/charge final image. Micro-setting (swan folds) evolves, mirroring internal dissolution. Spatial choreography coherent in burrowing descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating to deepest silence signaled early via swan; textural escalation deepens via corridor reveals to river's purest form, narrowing to endurance in chamber. Agency in unfolding/burrowing; cost felt in returning with "nothing but memory." Minor: stakes viscerally quiet, pressure coherent but subtle under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Regenerative silence emerges organically from observations (seven thousand volumes, post-war fields) to river realization, final image reweights premise without moral: "fragments falling to become sediment." Subtext in loose reality-grip invites ambiguity; no tidy morals, complexity in peace's necessary crumbling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (silence's "varieties, habits"); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density to charged poise. Purposeful compression (folds revealing passages) taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue; inference matches keeper's loose grip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short lamp-gutter sentence into reflective hum); purposeful "silence" recurrence patterns textural lens without loops. Figuratives integrated (reality as frightened bird, mineral tears); no artifacts dull closure image of woman/reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: origami swan's folds as catacomb navigator transforms lost-knowledge trope into textural quest; risk in lyric vignette heightens stakes of impermanence. Core premise inevitable in hindsight, no derivative echoes; bold voice commits to regenerative cycle.</comment>
