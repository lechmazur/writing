<comment>Painter's motivation rooted in traits intensifies via self-mirage, compelling her to teach Lisha with embodied cost of heartbeats; contradictory grace amid erosion acts in scene. Lisha as secondary forces relational shift. Final endurance earned by prior causality, foreclosing solitary diminishment.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds to shared lullaby mirage as tightening, reweighting stake; closure as Charged Poise in narrowed heartbeat silence after "the silence between beats narrowed." Orientation anchored early in terrace/ rains. Lens holds to legible cost in final image.</comment>

<comment>Prism parapet rainwater constrains mirage formation and charges self-vision; echoing amplifies songs, sensory hierarchy via painter's calm filters urgency. Mirrors evolve to show possibilities, mirroring internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake (mirages vs. heartbeat cost) signaled early, deepens via Lisha's counter-melody narrowing options to shared future. Agency in joint singing forces trade-off; cost legible in "silence between her heartbeats grew wider." Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of permissions via possibilities emerges from particulars like moth-moon lullaby shifting to self-mirage; final image reconfigures borrowed cost into communal renewal without moral. Subtext in grace amid erosion invites ambiguity on diminishment.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable, perceptual signature in biased noticing of rain-prisms and silences; diction/rhythm modulates from calm to wonder at "her calm deepening into something closer to wonder." No head-hopping, voice particular.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>High density with propulsion: varied syntax/rhythm in peak mirage ("landscapes that did not yet exist"); no loops, metaphors coherent like "stone ribbon." Read-aloud ear perfect, no overwriting in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of singing mirages, borrowed heartbeats, and mirror permissions transforms folklore tropes via specific erosion cost; self-mirage turn inevitable from pattern, risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to Charged Poise.</comment>
