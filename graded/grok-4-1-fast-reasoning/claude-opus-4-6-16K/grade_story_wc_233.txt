<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's disenchantment and dream-pull show contradictory impulses acting in the climb and crown removal; final renunciation earned by years of torment with felt sovereignty cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from dreams to pool vision as resonant reconfiguration ("rule the threshold"), tightening to crown removal with legible cost; orientation anchored early in climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt and ember grottos constrain ascent and charge pool image; "lace that could cut" recurring threads mirror internal menace, filtering through queen's dream-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant dream-unraveling stake signaled early, deepens at audible vision forcing throne-vs-threshold trade-off; crown set aside forecloses old path with on-page agency and cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shared dreamer recognition reweights sovereignty premise toward threshold rule; crown on stone offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with dream-haunted perceptual signature ("hemorrhage of light"); brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden, distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm mirroring climb's deliberation; purposeful figurative weave ("luminous blood") coherent, no loops dulling pool revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Bleeding starlight" transforms queen trope into threshold mythos; firefly exhale synthesis feels inevitable, risking quiet close without gimmick.</comment>
