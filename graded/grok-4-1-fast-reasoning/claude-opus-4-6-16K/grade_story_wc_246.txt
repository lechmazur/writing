<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Confidently uncertain trait drives interior conflict, shown in pruning distortions as "wrong seeds" then embracing them; final revision earns change with cost of prior barren months. Mother's pen embodies motivation holistically. No unearned epiphanies; impulses act via method shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anomaly distortions to lattice mapping, culminating in CR closure ("revised herself alongside it") with conceptual cost of mutable history. Orientation anchors early (station, job, anomaly). Single scene coherent, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anomaly as setting constrains choices (warped signals demand new method) and charges final image (pulsing breath, bending starlight). Pen micro-setting evolves from tool to talisman, mirroring theme. Sensory details (light halos, headphones) POV-filtered via interpreter's intuition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (parse anomaly's true signal) deepens accumulatively via contingent mapping, narrowing from error-filtering to embrace; agency in unbending assumptions forecloses rigid path. Cost legible in patience after "wrong seeds." One tightening sufficient, charges Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mutable history emerges via signal web, reweighted in final realization without statement; pen's shift answers "thresh meaning" question resonantly. Complexity in paradox (confidently uncertain) avoids tidy moral. Final image non-literal, recharges particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cosmos as "stammering truths"); rhythmic prose modulates from ambiguity to comfort. Voice particular to interpreter: intuition over tech. No head-hopping or leaks; diction biases toward patterns in noise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring realization cadence; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (mobile trembling), taught early without muddle in peak. Minor density in metaphors contained, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: anomaly edits signals like memory, transformed via interpreter's paradox; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes. Premise non-obvious, particulars (iridium nib, gamma whispers) irreplaceable. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
