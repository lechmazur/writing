<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete embodiment ("whispered... 'I'm still watching'") and contradictory impulses (uncertainty in chemical method but acts anyway); final endurance earned via talisman tie-in and intervention, foreclosing inaction with felt cost of lichen's doom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; orientation anchors immediately ("Loss Ridge... Tunguska-class impactor"); Charged Poise closure at "shutter closed... lichen blazed... grain gleamed," reconfiguring vigilance with undeniable conceptual cost of extinction despite proof captured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Environment (crater rim, regolith, lichen glow) constrains choices (switchbacks, chemical painting, hush wait) and charges final image ("blue-green glow faded as sunlight overpowered it"); POV bias selective and vivid, no white-room flaws.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph dying lichen) signaled early, tightens via chemical intervention and hush wait narrowing options; agency in patience/endurance forecloses path with cost legible in "within a season... would bleach to nothing," charging photo as trade-off under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vigilant endurance emerges organically from particulars (talisman, chemicals as "letter... not yet"); final image descent "carrying... proof" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting extinction with preservation's quiet cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("what the rock remembered"); rhythmic control modulates to hush silence, purposeful compression in dawn hush beat heightens pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels ("shutter release... ninety seconds... crackle"), metaphors coherent ("nebula seen from within"); no overwriting in peak hush beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic impact lichen and chemical "messages" transforms vigilance trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via irreplaceable talisman-photo reprise, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
