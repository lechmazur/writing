<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in backwards walking under pressure followed by forward annotation choice; motivation for quiet resilience deeply embodied and particular to Maren's archival worldview, earning stasis with relational cost. Interiority concrete via grandmother's tea geometry. Sable's off-page presence limits crucible dynamics but amplifies Maren's solo endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of discoveries (teacup, shadow, leaves) builds to charged poise closure in centered annotation and shadow paperweight, reconfiguring exile's symmetry with felt cost of patient waiting. Orientation anchored early in library/shard-mirrors. Single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Library's rib-like stacks and light column constrain movement and discoveries; playground swing shadow and hush-moment recur to charge final image, mirroring internal displacement. Sensory selection POV-biased toward geometry. Micro-objects (pen, cup) enable annotation tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mentoring resilience signaled early via vouching; textural deepening through leaf geometry and blank page forces annotation renunciation of overt rescue, foreclosing combative justice with endurance cost legible in final swing image. One decisive cadence shift suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of legible resilience emerges organically from shadow/leaf geometries and annotation spiral, reweighting exile without moralizing; final "remain legible after breaking" and swing offer non-literal answer to Sable's plea. Subtext in silence vs fury builds quiet complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with Maren's geometric perceptual signature (angles, arcs, symmetry); rhythmic modulation heightens hush-moment poise without elision. Distinct texture in archival metaphors sustains under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphor density (e.g., "relational crucible" absent, but "nervous architecture" voice-fit); varied rhythm propels to closure image without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative layering in peak annotation beat purposeful for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard-mirrors preserving shadows ingeniously synthesize archival metaphor for trauma/exile; transforms tropes via reversible geometry and combative tenderness. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes through irreplaceable images.</comment>
