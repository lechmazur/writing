<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete embodiment (mouth tasting copper) and contradictory impulses (seeks scars but accepts miracle); unwraps hand despite loss, earning final turn-over with visible cost. Voice-specific flaws (maladaptive literacy) drive micro-choices without hedging. No diagnostic labels flatten crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density tightens from coffee rings to sand-up revelation, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure with legible cost (erased scar story). Orientation anchored immediately (wakes in tower post-surgery). Single scene coheres without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower micro-setting (cot, east window, ivy wall) constrains choices and charges final image; recurring hourglass fogs under palm warmth, mirroring internal state. Sensory hierarchy (hiss of sand, cold glass) reflects POV urgency without catalog. No white-room; spatial choreography precise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar literacy vs. unwanted healing) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ivy doubt and sand reversal, narrowing options with agency in final turn-over. Cost unmistakable: "wanted the wound back" unmet, foreclosing path. One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stories/scars endure via hush mistaken for peace; final image ("sand tunneled upward... turned the hourglass over") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in implications (ivy growth as persistence) invites ambiguity. No platitudes; earned from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (reads rings like tree cores, plant thoughts as "slow green thought"); rhythmic modulation heightens dawn hush. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied syntax, no loops); figurative layering (sand "tunneling through itself") purposeful under accumulative lens, no muddle in peak reveal. Minor density in reflections doesn't dull closure image. Read-aloud rhythm natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scar literacy + plant telepathy + reversed miracle transforms tropes organically; sand-up turn risks lyric ingenuity, heightening stakes inevitably. No template echoes; bold premise commits without retreat.</comment>
