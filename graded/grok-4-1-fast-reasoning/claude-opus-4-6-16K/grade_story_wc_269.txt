<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Solid interiority via tapping as sonar-like thinking, concrete and particular; motivation to probe anomalies intensifies credibly to earned shift from witness to recorder. Revelation compels typing with felt cost in renouncing passivity, shown when she stops tapping: "The silence felt enormous." Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in the solo scene caps at strong rather than exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: data density and tapping motifs build to CR closure via subsidence revelation reweighting sea-level premise. Orientation anchored early (Station 7, 11 months). Cost legible in "silence felt enormous" and ghost islands image before typing the truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station console, windowsill, gray Atlantic selectively vivid and POV-filtered by researcher's priorities; tapping surfaces constrain thinking process. Recurring atlas charges final image: "vanished atolls glowed... ghost islands," mirroring internal realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anomalies/paths vanishing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to revelation narrowing interpretive options. Agency in assembling data forces CR; cost felt in confronting past witnessing inadequacy and future voids. Revelation whisper as peak beat delivers legible price without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of insufficient response emerges organically from particulars: voids collapsing paths, witnessing vs. action. Final atlas-to-window image offers resonant CR repricing ban as "tourniquet after the limb was already lost," reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in tapping resonances and sonar metaphor; voice texture lyrical yet precise, modulating rhythm to revelation's silence. Diction biased toward marine researcher (e.g., "sonar assembles a seafloor from echoes").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., short "She tapped." builds propulsion); purposeful tapping repetition taught early avoids loops. No artifacts; metaphors coherent (whisper revelation, glowing atlas), propelling to charged close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-ban subsidence voids as hidden collapse transforms climate trope via tapping-as-assembly and path reinterpretation. Atlas ghost image inevitable in hindsight; risks lyric reflection without gimmick.</comment>
