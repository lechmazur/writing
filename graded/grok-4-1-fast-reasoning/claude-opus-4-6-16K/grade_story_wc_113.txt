<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to stay and play is rooted in concrete inspirations and code fragments, driving micro-choices like opening the violin case under flood pressure; embodied resolve shines in wading to podium, with endurance foreclosing evacuation path at felt physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: floodwater causally reveals reactive ink and matching notes, tightening to resonant music dialogue; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with "Thank you" image and fading ink cost, reconfiguring ghost as architectural across century.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded pit with jutting stands and flickering lanterns constrains wading and revelation; recurring water as micro-setting enables ink images and sound conduction, charging final drying program and memorized face.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel/complete opera signaled early via inspirations; agency in playing escalates resonance from building under Accumulative lens, with physical flood cost and foreclosed safety path tightening to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trans-temporal musical dialogue emerges from water-revealed score and architectural echoes; final fading "Thank you" reweights hidden persistence motif without moralizing, resonating via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with musician's perceptual signature (silences, resonances, ink shapes); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed buildup to shivering crescendo, distinct texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory action ("oil-dark water," "lanterns shivered"); varied syntax propels from hush to resolution without loops or muddled figures, ear-test clean at peak music beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reactive ink, acoustic architecture, and flood as revealer transforms ghost trope; risk in solo endurance amid rising water heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via building logic.</comment>
