<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in ethical diligence, with embodied fear of betrayal in lost seconds compelling precise micro-choices like chipping shards; minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents perfect score, but final endurance of diligence earns change with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from crack to seventh-visit alloy completion; on-page Charged Poise closure in pendulum's pause restores balance invisibly, with legible cost in incremental patience—"each line absolved her a little more."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and tide pools vividly constrain choices (sharp chipping during low tide) and charge final image ("balanced on the edge of a black glass world"); sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's precise priorities, no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring shared balance signaled early, escalates accumulatively through failed foundry to inscription-guided visits narrowing options; agency in alloy creation forces trade-off of time/fear, charging closure with felt cost of unnoticed restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges organically from particulars like rake inscriptions and shard visits, reweighting premise in final resonant image of "balance restored is invisible" without moralizing; theme inextricable from Maren's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (luminous pauses, searing light) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens reverie under pressure, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid, integrated images ("fissure ran through the cast iron weight like a black vein"); varied rhythm propels without loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught in reverie texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obsidian alloy pendulum from rake inscriptions transforms clock-repair trope into tidal absolution mythos; risk-taking in accumulative reverie heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
