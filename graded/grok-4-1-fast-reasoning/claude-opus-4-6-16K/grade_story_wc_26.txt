<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in daughter's unbinding paralleling shadows, embodied via river stone grip; interiority concrete and particular without stock phrasing. Final endurance earned through accumulated observations, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal archive moment. Backstory anchors present choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setting observations to video evidence and personal loss, culminating in CR closure—"The shadow is unbound, but I am not"—with conceptual cost of isolation felt in stone grip and notebook. Orientation anchored early in ascent/cloud library. Single scene coherent, no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming library and cloud-glass vividly constrain her physical isolation/anchorage, mirroring internal stake; river stone as micro-setting charges final image, thumb-pressed depression embodying proof against dream dilution. Sensory details (UV flowers, wind-turning pages) selective via her dusk bias. No white-room; spatial coherence in archive room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope/physicality) signaled early, escalates via deepening evidence (Berlin footage orphan shadow) under accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance choice with felt cost in regret/altitude weight. Agency in recording despite dilution risk; one tightening sufficient. No abstract stakes—tied to daughter's metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unbinding emerges organically from particulars (migrating shadows, daughter's ambitions), reweighted in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in stone/notebook vs. drifting shadow. Subtext in silence of muted footage; ambiguity lingers in hope's fragility. No tidy binaries—physical persistence costs solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (dusk retreats, silhouettes detaching); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from descriptive to charged compression at dusk. No head-hopping/elision issues; voice particular to sharp-eyed observer. Minor register elevation in "luminous regret" fits lyric texture without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., stone as anchor/proof); rhythmic variety in sentence lengths/paragraph breaks propels to closure. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("flowering outward like petals... blooming library") during setup, but consistent and non-muddling; no loops/artifacts dulling peak archive observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-sharing dystopia, migrating shadows, floating libraries transforms tropes via specific logic (thermal ascent, UV moss); risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens isolation stakes. Final CR inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
