<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elody's lukewarm magic and earnest belief drive consistent micro-choices like angle adjustments, earning the closure endurance with embodied contradiction in acknowledging absurdity yet persisting. Interiority particular via tea-warmth spells and graduation tears. No safety-hedging; naivete as pivotal flaw enables success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of drops builds to crack sealing as Charged Poise RR with cost in brittle devotion. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (viaduct, dawn, harbor). Single scene coherent; closure cost legible in "her naivete the only engine strong enough."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct constrains ritual (drip-point positions bell); dawn light evolves causally, charging final gleam. Sensory selective via mage bias (resonance, tempo). Micro-setting (bell, channel lip) mirrors internal devotion without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via drop accumulation narrows to Return Frequency, agency in recalibrating forecloses failure with cost in conscious renewal. Silver flash and ocean breath tighten under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brittle devotion emerges via viaduct lore and bell ritual, reweighted in final image without moralizing. Naivete answers cosmic fracture organically; resonance from particulars like 211th drop.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (tempo as conversation, dripping syllables). Rhythmic diction modulates to incantatory peak ("one drop every four seconds"); no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "brittle devotion... constant, conscious renewal" advances character/theme/prose). Varied rhythm propels; no loops, coherent metaphors (vein of sky). Zero artifacts; read-aloud flows seamlessly to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dripping rates as cosmic tempo via lukewarm mage transforms eco-apocalypse into devotion-led balance. Risky quiet closure (unsealing crack) inevitable from established viaduct logic; no tropes unearned.</comment>
