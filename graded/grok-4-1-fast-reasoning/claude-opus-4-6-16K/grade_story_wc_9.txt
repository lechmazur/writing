<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between reading strangers' futures and own unwitnessed life embodied in birth moment and ritual choice; final renunciation earned by card perplexity with cost of accepting irrecoverable time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing in "You do not get the time back. You get the glade."; cost legible in foreclosed recovery, moss trace as charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moss "cold and alive beneath her knees" and moonlight "columns in a ruined cathedral" constrain ritual; saucer crack recharges final image "pointing the way home."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering lost time tightens through perplexed reading into altitude realization; agency in leaning into fog forecloses recovery path with felt cost of acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief as altitude emerges organically from glade ritual; final "crack... beautiful enough to stop the breath" non-literally reweights lost time premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct cartomancer perceptual signature in "onyx surface... drinking the moonlight"; rhythmic modulation sustains lyric pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures like "rain that had never touched soil"; varied rhythm propels to luminous crack without loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh cloud-glade premise and hand-tracing spread transform cartomancy; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
