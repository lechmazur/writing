<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via translator's analogical lens; motivation intensifies from brother's unreadable expression to planting seed, earning closure shift with embodied weeping. Kindly methodical trait constrains precise actions under grief. No unearned epiphanies; impulses align without alternation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: metaphorical density builds to CR closure in arbor's growth and Elara's tracing, reweighting transition as translation with emotional cost in final weeping image. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor and fruit constrain choices (seed planted in "dark earth where roots converge"); sensory details (hum in teeth/iron blood, hair lifting) filter through POV, charge final growth image. Purposeful, integrated vividness without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand transition) signaled early, deepens via fruit/seed revelation narrowing to translation act; agency in planting forecloses ignorance with legible cost in "wept, kindly and methodically." Accumulative pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of translation/memory emerges organically from cuneiform analogies and arbor-as-text; final image ("his pattern in the new branch's first trembling growth") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting ambitions via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in nested metaphors; rhythmic prose modulates to intensity (short sentences in planting beat). Distinct texture in syntax reflects translator's methodical mind; no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fire consumes a library" embodies obsession); varied rhythm accelerates to closure without loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle. Propulsion clean, read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform physics and magnetic afterlife; arbor as "living text" transforms tropes organically, risking poetic sci-fi with inevitable hindsight payoff in growth image. Bold, coherent vision.</comment>
