<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory defiance (past distrust vs. mischievous rise) acts in scene via night shift choice and bolt placement; final trust earned by survival causality with cost of foreclosed external schemes. Interiority concrete via embodied warmth of bolt and light trust. No safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of leaks/texts builds to tightening bolt placement creating coherence structure. Closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page ("structure of pure coherence... it held") with conceptual cost of internalized pressure direction. Orientation anchored early; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mushroom domes constrain climax choice (seven species convergence for bolt); final cathedral light charges image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (indigo wavelengths, pulsing breath) POV-biased via Mara's transformation lens. No white-room; tactile lived-in (warm bolt palm).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness leak via pressure knowledge) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via texts to agency in bolt focus foreclosing distrust path. Cost legible in laugh echoing past survival. One cadence shift suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (pressure as internal tool) emerges from pyramid failure to quantum structure; final "direction... from within" image resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral. Particulars (bolt, light) shift meaning organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (light/shimmer as pressure metaphors); rhythmic diction modulates to peak compression ("It was beautiful... because it held"). No head-hopping; voice character-specific defiance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy peak sentences); no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence (light prisms purposeful). Minor density in opening descriptions doesn't touch closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pyramid trauma + quantum leaks yields non-obvious "diamond" via bolt/lens; risk in shadowseam tone heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from particulars.</comment>
