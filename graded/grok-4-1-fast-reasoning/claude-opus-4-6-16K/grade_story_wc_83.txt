<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied grief ("grief had weight and texture") and contradictory impulses (bleak exhilaration amid loss) compelling micro-choices like perturbation modeling; final endurance earned by trauma-rooted motivation with visible cost in unchanged rubble. Minor reflection density nears BRR ceiling but anchors to present hunt without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation (observatory, 11 months post-strike) and tightening via anomaly spike discovery; closure as Charged Poise/CR in "She is different now" line reconfigures self-understanding with felt cost of persistent loss, constraint of 40-minute window shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (watches, touched at end) and charges final image; selective sensory details (dim lighting on amethyst, cold/sharp touch) mirror internal pooling via POV bias, evolved causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt pools in timed window) signaled early with textural escalation via disproportionate perturbation response narrowing options; agency in fast keyboard work forces renunciation of institutional drive, cost legible in return to "scheduled work" despite discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pooled potential emerges organically from geode/pools/survivor parallels, reweighted in final "broken open herself" realization without moralizing; resonant CR answers survival's ambiguity through charged image, complexity in moral refusal of institutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("every equation was a body") biases noticing toward tangible physics; rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in hunt) with stable close-third POV, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "pooled" motif rhythm varying propulsion (e.g., "She works fast" accelerates); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (frozen light geode), minor register elevation in physics but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone trauma and cosmic perturbation hunting transforms widow trope into astrophysical "pools" hunt; risk in bleak exhilaration tone heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via geode callback charging closure.</comment>
