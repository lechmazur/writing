<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene ("peace with that arithmetic" vs. "sting she would never admit to"), earning the final endurance of sentiment with visible emotional cost. Interiority concrete and particular, rooted in calculating displacements vs. species silence. Flaws complicate without hedging; micro-choices like leaving the egg reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: activating array and leaving egg reconfigures her stance, cost legible in "sentimentality... weakness she could not afford / But... she let it." Orientation anchored early ("edge of the Arden Salt Flat"); one tightening via release suffices. Backstory interleaved with present cues tilts choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat and cracks constrain choice ("precise coordinates... convergence point") and charge final image (boots crunching across "white expanse"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (fissures as "cartography of thirst"); thunder evolves causally, mirroring internal tension. Micro-setting (egg case, speaker) tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echoes via ritual) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to release tightening options (rain erases map post-act). Agency in every beat; moral calculus sharpens peak ("eleven thousand... vs. permanent silence"). Cost unmistakable in foreclosed sentiment and human price reweighted at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of echoes outlasting sins emerges from particulars (cracks as "suffering... ink," voices looping fifty years); final image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting amorality with sentiment without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (sets egg like "altar offering"); ambiguity lingers in her letting the call follow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (calculating imagery: "spines of ancient books," "broken mirror") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from reflective to pressurized release. POV stable single third close; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue; diction reflects analytical mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere ("thunder rolled... conversation she was not invited to join"); rhythm varies naturally, propulsion peaks at activation. Metaphors coherent and sparse ("cathedral where... gathered"); zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts even in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes eco-terror and sentiment ("killed a river to read its bones"); fresh angle transforms tropes via specific calculus and ghost-voices ritual. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from cracks-map to speaker-echoes.</comment>
