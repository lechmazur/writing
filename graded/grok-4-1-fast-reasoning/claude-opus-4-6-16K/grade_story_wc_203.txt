<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marco's contradictory impulses—ignoring ghosts for 23 years yet engaging when stared at—act in scene, earning the closure choice to pocket the locket with felt continuity cost to his isolation. Interiority concrete via ceiling philosophy; embodied reactions (looks away from neck) reveal traits under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cracks to barrel to ghost release as RR (dust settles quietly), with legible cost in "secrets lighter now by one." Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored early (Marco at circus ticket office).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ceiling cracks and dust constrain discovery choice and charge final image ("plaster held its silence"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (flashlight sweeps first). Circus ghost and warped boards tactile, mirroring internal secrets without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hidden truths amid repair) deepens accumulatively via dust disruption to lights dying, forcing engagement trade-off. Agency in unscrewing barrel forecloses ignoring ghosts; cost felt in ghost's flicker and his resolve to find Marguerite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges organically from ceiling observation to ghost release, reweighting premise in final image ("cracks...told him everything") without moral. Resonance from particulars like engraved elephants and acrobat photo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with observational perceptual signature ("ceilings...collect every secret"); rhythm modulates precisely under stress (short sentences at ghost turn). Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances via specifics (dust patterns, fogged breath); zero loops, varied rhythm, no artifacts. Final line recharges ceilings motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seeing repairman and ceiling philosophy transforms supernatural tropes; horologist barrel in circus feels inevitable, risking subtle release over drama.</comment>
