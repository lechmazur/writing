<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the climax ("the part of her that wanted to let humanity die... held it as Kwan Yin had held the suffering world"), earning the integration choice with embodied cost; no diagnostic overreach flattens it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as grief density builds to seam-opening RR (Charged Poise), with cost legible in "stitched her own darkness into wholeness"; orientation anchors early ("recycled spaceship Cenotaph"), one seamless scene progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Photographs' "faint shimmer of long-dried tears" and body-as-setting (feet anchoring/lifting) constrain choices and charge final image of floating; selective sensory integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open Inward) deepens via shadow confrontation, driven by agency under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in metabolizing "sorrows that were not her own" and facing extinction desire, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of compassion-through-shadow emerges organically from particulars (grief absorption to wholeness), final image ("humanity that began... with the full... knowledge of its own shadow") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to grief-anchors and emotional residue; rhythmic control heightens pressure ("The crystal blazed. The air... split") without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds, metaphors cohere (seam "breathed open like a lung"); propulsion varies rhythmically, no figurative muddle in peak ("The locked dimension breathed open").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi extinction, bodhisattva relic, and psychological integration transforms tropes; risk-taking in "tears contain trace proteins" yields inevitable hindsight payoff at soul-gathering closure.</comment>
