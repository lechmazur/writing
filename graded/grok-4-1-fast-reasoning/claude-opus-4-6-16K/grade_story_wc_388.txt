<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied stillness entering her chest and weeping from relief; motivation to excavate truth compels diamond test and dialing with earned pause showing contradiction. Final choice forecloses skepticism with personal cost. No safety-hedging; flaws like initial disbelief transform via pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory shards build to dosimeter silence and intuition as cadence shift. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Charged Poise in dialing amid hum/storm reconfigures possibilities with conceptual cost legible in "change what people believed was possible."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard's thriving roots and dosimeter constrain choices, narrowing to kneeling/intuition; recurring dust storm charges final image of trees holding firm. Sensory hierarchy (clicking silence, amber haze) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (Mother tree, diamond) mirrors internal unbrokenness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. lie) signaled early, deepens via diamond silencing dosimeter to force intuition/decision. Agency in pressing diamond and dialing forecloses silence option with felt cost (relief, world change). Escalation accumulates under lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of deeper order beneath decay emerges organically from orchard/stillpoint particulars; final dialing image reweights premise without moralizing. Diamond fracture and tree roots shift meaning as non-literal answer to broken-world question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in precise observation (dosimeter "clicking softly like a mechanical heartbeat"). Rhythm modulates from arrival tension to stillness release; diction controlled and biased to skeptic's lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "roots drinking from poisoned aquifers" advancing world/atmosphere; varied rhythm accelerates to weeping/dialing without loops or scaffolds. No figurative muddle; propulsion peaks in "unbearable relief of encountering something...true."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc orchard as stillpoint-fed truth anchor transforms conspiracy trope; risk in quiet intuition arc heightens stakes via irreplaceable diamond/orchard logic. Inevitable hindsight from letters to call.</comment>
