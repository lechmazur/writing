<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses vividly embodied in "wanted to tear down the Authority with her hands" versus pressing eye to theodolite; final patience earned through micro-choices like nightly transits, with visible cost of restrained rage foreclosing destruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations density builds to final night's Charged Poise/CR, reconfiguring impatience to patient menace; cost legible in "patience... the most dangerous thing," with persistent archive constraint shaping all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt pillars and ferric viaduct patterns filter through mapper's priorities, constraining calibrations; frozen lake mirrors internal unyoking, charging closure image of moon-painted ice holding latent water power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (true atlas vs. corruption) tightens accumulatively via growing archive, forcing endurance trade-off; agency in patient mapping forecloses rage with cost felt in "scream building inside her chest" restrained on final platform.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient truth-accumulation emerges via ice/breath motifs shifting from preservation to latent danger; final image non-literally answers "sculpt patience from impatience" by reweighting revolution as quiet menace, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature in precise geometries ("fraction of a degree") modulates rhythm with pressure, compressing under wind-scream wildness; purposeful elision of colleagues keeps focus coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies propulsively, metaphors coherent (fist of stone to sculpting patience); final line's breath-dissolve image recharges motifs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obsolete cartography vs. institutional fraud transforms whistleblower trope into textural revolution; risk in quiet stasis heightens stakes, inevitable via viaduct-archive particulars.</comment>
