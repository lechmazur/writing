<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Guarded druid's interior contradiction—finding others' losses erodes her warmth—manifests in concrete micro-choices like staff as barrier and vine-stepping risk, earning the unbend at "a fist she had mistaken for her spine." Motivation intensifies via failed spells and thawing confessions. No safety-hedging; flaws drive struggle to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of voices builds via circles to Charged Poise closure where breathing out slows vortex with felt cost of released guardedness. Orientation anchored immediately ("Maren watched from the shore"); one tightening via seed-vine enables center entry. Experimental vignette coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (snapping roots, pulsing seed, hanging voice) filters through druid's priorities, constraining choices—vine as bridge, trees as wall. Vortex mirrors internal unbending subtly; final stilled lake recharges reflection image. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mother's confession for self-healing) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through confession layers narrowing to personal revelation, forcing unbend renunciation with legible cost in loosened staff hold. Agency drives vine tactic amid entropy pressure. Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lost inner permission emerges organically from finding-gift irony and thawing confessions, culminating in resonant non-literal answer: "permission to stop searching" reweights prior material via stilled lake image. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in earned stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature—guarded noticing of "cursed fruit," "frozen confessions"—with rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences at entry). Prose texture distinct, lyric without opacity; voice embodies druid's unbending arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "vortex of bark, black water, and cursed fruit" advances setting, stakes, tone). Varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative language purposeful, pattern-taught. Read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: druid's finding-gift curses self-healing via entropy-defying vine and confession-archive lake transforms tropes organically. Risky warlike-serenity tone heightens stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars. No derivatives.</comment>
