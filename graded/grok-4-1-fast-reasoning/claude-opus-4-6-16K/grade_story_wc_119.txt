<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei Lin's motivation to escape scrutiny via isolation feels rooted and consistent, with endurance of her writing compulsion earning stasis amid investigators' visit. Interiority shines in concrete reflections like fortunes as "tiny dense packets of implication," revealing character under pressure. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses in peak investigative beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building density from past microdot incident to jars, visit, and final diplomat fortune for Conceptual Repricing closure. Cost legible in inescapable patterns: "fortunes waited... like open secrets patient enough to outlast." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via persistent prophecy reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via isolation ("supply boat... twice a month") and charges closure with beam pulse mirroring fortunes' rhythm. Sensory details selective/POV-biased: "Atlantic threw itself against the island's foundations." Micro-object jars on stairs evolve, mirroring internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prophetic gift's danger vs. compulsion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through investigation and persistence, narrowing to endurance with isolation cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise in final beam/fortune image. One deepening via agent's pocketed slip forces ongoing unease.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets/prophecy emerges organically from fortunes' "nonsense and revelation," reweighted in closure: diplomat's unsettlement echoes "You will find yourself on the rocks." Resonant non-literal answer via beam as accidental oracle, with conceptual cost of undecodable truth. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: notices implications in microdots, beams as fortunes. Prose texture distinct—rhythmic, compressed diction like "slips curling like small white tongues." No dialogue; elisions (past shards) taught early, paid off in reprise. Perceptual bias character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion aligns with reflective rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Standout: "ink in water" expands implication without overwriting. Varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with scene; final line recharges motifs crisply. Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune writer's microdot tie to lighthouse beam as oracle transforms tropes organically. Risk in accumulative prophecy pattern heightens stakes; diplomat's distant reading inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
