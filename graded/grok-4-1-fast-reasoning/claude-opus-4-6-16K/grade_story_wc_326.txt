<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through heartbeat counting as embodied compulsion revealing contradiction between digital erasure and vital proof; final stop counting earns change with cost of rebuilt self. Shard and ink use reveal values under pressure. No safety-hedging; flaws like past frustration drive deliberate reconstruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fragments builds to Charged Poise closure where "Status: living" and ceased counting reconfigure existence with conceptual cost of deliberate fragility. Orientation anchored early in observatory climb. Single scene fits scope; radio window provides one tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Opal dome as cathedral-like sanctuary mirrors internal solace, constraining via snow isolation and radio window that shapes tactics; final dome press evokes refracted light charging closure image. Sensory hierarchy (frost door, humming static) filters through Maren's priorities. Evolving details like cleared static integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (digital resurrection) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ink patterns narrowing satellite window; agency in shard-guided spills forecloses old trusting self with felt cost in "assembled with full knowledge of how easily it could shatter." Pressure coheres to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of analog rebellion against algorithmic erasure emerges organically from ink defragmentation and heartbeat cessation; final non-literal image ("stopped counting") reweights premise without moral, embracing fragility's complexity. Shard motif shifts from breakage reminder to tool, charging resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in heartbeat counts and pattern-bleeds; rhythmic control modulates from compulsive tally to peaceful halt, reflecting mind's state. Prose texture distinct (e.g., "digital ghost haunting her own life") without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels: each line layers action, image, interiority sans loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short counts punctuate long patterns), peaking crisply at "stopped counting." Figuratives purposeful (e.g., "jagged aftermath"), no muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic horror via ink-hex patterns in legacy scanner transforms digital ghost trope; porcelain shard's evolution from smashed teacup to tool heightens ingenuity. Risky poetic compression feels inevitable, committing to premise without retreat.</comment>
