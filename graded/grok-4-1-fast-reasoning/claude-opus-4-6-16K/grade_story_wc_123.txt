<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied through meteorological lens on truth ("accuracy was her form of prayer"); final endurance earned by data devotion vs. surveillance risk, with micro-choice to retrieve samples foreclosing safety. Contradictory impulses subtle but act in scene (solitude prayer meets external threat). No unearned epiphanies; flaws (isolation enabling trust) complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of data layers (storms, pigeons, reports) tightens to Charged Poise/CR closure in final paragraph, where silence "settle[s] around her like armor" reconfigures stakes with undeniable risk cost (retrieval despite followers). Orientation anchored by para 1; one meaningful deepening via new tube message. No causality breaks; lens taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting constrains and charges closure (sits "beneath the linden" uncapping tube, ending with dusk-to-night evolution mirroring resolve); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (wind vectors, linden coins). Details purposeful (fountain murmur layers tranquility), integrated into thought/action. Recurring linden/swallows subtly mirror internal steadiness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge data to truth vs. suppression/followers) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tube's coordinates forcing retrieval choice with felt cost ("weight of what it asked"). Agency in endurance/renunciation legible; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. Minor abstractness in broader outbreak but on-page legibility holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth surviving "in margins and decimal places" emerges organically from data-pigeon synthesis, resonant CR in final image reweighting unremarkable breeze/storm logs without moral state. Complexity in rogue cover-up ambiguity; no tidy binaries. Subtext in silences/gestures (folding slip into logbook).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (quantified winds, particulates as honesty); rhythmic control modulates from observant to resolute ("southwesterly, four knots, unremarkable"). Diction precise/POV-bound (anemometer, barometric drops); no elision or head-hopping. Voice as character: syntax mirrors meticulous precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (each line advances revelation/atmosphere); varied rhythm accelerates in realization beats, breathes in reflective pauses. No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent/patterned (light "coins," leaves "turn"). Closure image propulsive: "capped her pen, closed the logbook, and sat with the dusk until it became night."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms quarantine trope via lateral data-pigeon bridge, meteorological lens on bio-suppression yields non-obvious CR (integrity as armor). Quiet lyric risk heightens stakes; particulars (linden, tubes) inevitable in hindsight. No derivative hedging; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
