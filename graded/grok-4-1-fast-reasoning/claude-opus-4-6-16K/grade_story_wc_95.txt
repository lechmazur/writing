<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mechanical arm's clicking embodies nervous conflict between philosopher and weapon; needle card anchors reflective block to present micro-choice of covering cipher; refusal renunciation earned with cost of warrants, satisfying contradictory impulses test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: waiting pressure → cipher decode → ambassador confrontation → refusal DC as Earned Stasis foreclosing defection with immunity cost legible in final walk; orientation anchored by para 1; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sundial as tool constrains decoding choice and charges cover-up; brook's rippling light mirrors unspoken argument on Solenne's face; tactile arm tracing angles filters through POV bias, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defection for immunity) signaled via cipher, tightens situationally in dialogue crystallization; refusal agency forecloses path with opportunity cost felt in "my warrants?" query and exit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of questions as threads/destinations emerges via needle card → final Socratic query refusal reweighting institution vs idea without moralizing; brook walk as resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in arm's mechanical calculations; dialogue subtext sharp—"Is there a difference?" pursues goal vs Erasmus's Socratic indirection; voices distinct idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., light bands as argument oscillation); varied rhythm propels to "dignified chaos" cadence; zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dueling philosopher synthesis fresh, transforming blade/epistemology trope; needle card as decision compass inevitable in hindsight; risk of quiet stasis heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
