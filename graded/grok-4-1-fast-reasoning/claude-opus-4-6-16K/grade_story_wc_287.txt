<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between pragmatism and naked faith act in the planting scene, earned through gauge tooth's multi-use revealing tender practicality; final endurance of tending costs emotional exposure without tidy resolution. Interiority particularized via locksmith habits embodied in soil work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as petal drop initiates density of light/growth images tightening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "tension between knowing something might not survive and planting it anyway" as final image reconfigures faith's premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Harbor light and fire escape railings constrain choices (mirrors angled down, illegal cutting planted); final wind off water charges jasmine tremble/hold image, with sensory hierarchy (moonlit mercury, oar rhythm) filtered through gardener's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reflecting light despite failure tightens accumulatively via petal loss to jasmine planting, agency in wistful pragmatism foreclosing inaction with illegality/uncertainty cost; rowboat cadence deepens pressure without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of justified risk in beauty emerges organically from alley-light reflection to jasmine's "quiver once... then hold still," reweighting premise non-literally; no moralizing, ambiguity in faith's embarrassment lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (architecture of open/close things) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates meditative pressure, diction biased to tactile growth ("hollow, press, cover, smooth").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm matching oar tempo; zero loops, purposeful figuratives ("mercury and glass") coherent, no artifacts dulling closure's "gauge tooth warm in her palm."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith gauge as gardening tool transforms trope of urban precarious beauty; risk in lyric hush/faith poise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from petal-to-jasmine arc.</comment>
