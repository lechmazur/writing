<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied vibrations felt in palms driving micro-choices like pouring the vial; endurance of solitude forecloses isolation with felt cost in secret efficacy. Donal's brief stance shows secondary pressure without dilution. Backstory anchors tilt present ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory vibrations builds to Charged Poise closure in final palms-to-wall image, reweighting lighthouse intent with conceptual cost of unprovable whispers; orientation anchors early in cobalt tower at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt stone, jasmine/cereus scents, vial on lens constrain ritual choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (vibrations, taste of air) reflects Maren's perceptual bias, evolving causally from heat wave break.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whisper-beckon vs scream-warning) signaled early, texturally escalates via vial pour deepening density to Donal's pull; agency in ritual forecloses repulsion path with legible emotional cost in his averted grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whispers-over-shouts emerges implicitly from vial ritual and Donal beat, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; resonance from particulars like seawater's purification avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (vibrations through stone/palms) biases noticing, with rhythmic modulation under dawn intensity; stable single-POV, brief external Donal shard clean and legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propulsion, varied syntax/rhythm breathe with ritual rise; no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence (light fractures into tenderness) serves closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse as beckoner via vibrations/intent transforms trope; risk in lyric textural drive heightens secret efficacy stakes organically.</comment>
