<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Curiosity embodied in concrete micro-choices like plotting starling avoidances compels the untethering decision with foreclosed safety (leaving Harwick's expected return). Internal voice particular via mapmaker's grid-seeing lens; no therapy-speak. Blind spot—not worrying—drives bold agency without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: phrasebook to hopscotch to starlings densifies toward map convergence (DC/RR closure). Charged Poise in "She followed them... toward the next bright unknown" with cost legible in left letter and solo risk. Orientation anchored early (airship, 11 days, birds); one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Airship micro-setting (dusty hopscotch near engines, fluttering pages) constrains via hidden clues and enables untethering. Starling murmurations as perceptual constraint charge final image ("living compass needle"). Sensory hierarchy mapmaker-biased: shapes, bearings over generic views.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart stranded luminance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via pattern convergence narrowing to one site. Agency in noting/launching forecloses staying with felt solo risk. Quiet pressure fits lens; no opposition but coherent tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trusting avian/maps over worry emerges via particulars (hopscotch "scripture," birds "living instruments"); final image reconfigures curiosity's cost non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in "ready to be found" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with mapmaker perceptual signature (figure-eights, bearings). Voice texture in rhythmic similes ("light pooled like spilled ink," "pages fluttering like small wings") modulates to propel. No head-hopping; elision of details earned by discoveries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density in lines like "each symbol corresponded to a bearing" advances multiple jobs. Rhythmic variety peaks in final ascent image without overwriting. Metaphors coherent (ink, wings, sediment).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hopscotch-grid as polyglot-map transforms discovery trope organically. Starlings as instruments synthesize fresh angle on "stranded luminance." Risky quiet closure heightens via irreplaceable patterns (+0.3).</comment>
