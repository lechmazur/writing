<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (longing to escape vs. staying to repair) embodied in her work and personal losses. Final renunciation of escape—stopping the clock—earned by prior causality, foreclosing departure with felt emotional cost. Flawless under single-POV defaults; sage traits constrain choices throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: density of repairs, tremors, moons builds to Charged Poise closure (comet captured, clock stopped) with legible cost in her ache to leave. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; quake incites coherent shards resolving in one window. No causality breaks; pattern pays off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (observatory on unstable summit) constrains choices (calibrate via leaf sound amid tremors) and charges final comet image. Sensory details (tasting starlight, mountain groans) filtered through Maren's optics bias, vivid yet economical. Micro-objects (Memory camera, clock) evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair to witness ephemeral vs. replace/forget) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via quake damage and unstable mountain forcing tactic shift (leaf calibration). Agency in restructuring forecloses replacement path with visible cost (three moons' labor); pressure coheres to closure image. One decisive deepening suffices perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (witnessing vs. escape) emerges organically from particulars (comet tail as "brushstroke of luminous ache"), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Subtext in clock/comet parallelism invites ambiguity on staying's cost. Resonance inextricable from Maren's arc; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, with perceptual signature (lenses as grief, silence as discipline) biasing notice. Prose rhythm modulates intensity (short quake sentences vs. flowing repairs); diction controlled, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No dialogue to judge; voice as character flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances image/pressure (e.g., "ephemeral cannot wait" anchors stakes). Rhythms vary (read-aloud flows); metaphors consistent (optics/grief pattern), no muddle/loops in peaks. Minor figurative density purposeful, charging closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: leaf-sound calibration on shaky lunar peak transforms repair trope into thematic engine. Risky lyricism (spinning clock as panic) heightens stakes organically; comet closure inevitable from established particulars. No derivative echoes; bold, cohesive vision.</comment>
