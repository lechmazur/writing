<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between empirical skepticism ("She was not a woman who believed in magic") and pattern compulsion act in the tracing/transcribing scene, earning the final covenant endurance with ironic cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of uncloaked stars to CR closure in "I will keep watching" whisper, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of devotion to silence; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Schematics and tile constrain decryption choice; courtyard stars charge final image, aligning with ancient patterns through POV-filtered dusk light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding tile deepens accumulatively via spiral absence, narrowing rationalism toward stance crystallization; cost felt in trembling hands and whispered renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Spiral's "deliberate absence" offers resonant answer to void-devotion question, reweighting irony from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of astronomical precision ("sequences that matched no known astronomical catalogue") modulates to charged whisper; stable limited POV with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in image-driven lines like "stars seemed to uncloak themselves" propels to closure without loops or muddle; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes Babylonian ciphers and modern cosmology into inevitable irony; risk of quiet CR heightens stakes via pattern specificity.</comment>
