<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal surrender earned by prior tracking quests, embodied in "glass cage in her chest" shattering; contradictory impulses (furious effort vs. rest) act simultaneously until climax resolution with three-year loss as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as meteor fragments build density to archway RR/CR; "astrolabe pointed downward. Here" decisive tightening with surrender's conceptual cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway constrains kneeling/climax and charges surrender image; astrolabe as micro-setting handled tactilely, sensory selection dream-biased ("funeral silks").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Trapped creativity stake signaled early, deepens accumulatively through site fragments to on-page pour-out; surrender agency forecloses effort with violent color return as unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surrender-over-effort theme emerges implicitly from tracking-to-rest arc; final "stars continued to fall, tracing silver paths" resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with dreamer's perceptual signature ("unspoken words that hovered behind people's teeth"); rhythmic modulation heightens to charged poise in climax whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; varied rhythm propels ("The trapped creativity poured out... flooding her veins"); peak "colors returned so violently she gasped" clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh stardust-residue premise and rest-as-creation-secret transform block trope; lyric risk-taking inevitable in hindsight from grandmother's method to final reconfiguration.</comment>
