<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied contradiction in hands "remembering" guardrail amid recount; final playing choice earned by crystallizing motivation against past "nevers," foreclosing doubt with felt cost in flake's warmth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from flake/map study to gorge-playing tightening, resolving in Charged Poise closure where map shifts and flake warms, reconfiguring self with conceptual cost of released "nevers"; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Guardrail's F-sharp hum and gorge's returned harmony constrain and charge playing choice, evolving with action; sensory hierarchy (wind, creak, vibration) mirrors internal release without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pixelated amnesty) signaled early, escalates via playing's cadence shift drawing strangers and warming flake, narrowing to Charged Poise with visible cost in sculpted "shape that could hold weight."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented forgiveness emerges organically via map/flake/pixels, final image of "forgiven in fragments, whole in aggregate" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "never" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musician's micro-observations (charcoal nails, ether smell); rhythmic control modulates from reflective density to propulsive playing, stable single POV with lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from opening gorge image to final "trembling mountain air"; no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (clouds as "cotton packed into a wound") cohere without muddle in peak playing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vanishing hitchhiker, pre-electric photo of self, and amnesty map transforms mystic tropes via fiddler's observant precision; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure's inevitability.</comment>
