<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in cog analysis blending sacred/mercantile history against factions, earning final endurance with futility cost; interiority particular via stratigraphic lens on artifacts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise/CR closure in "scraped another millimeter into the past," reweighting preservation with isolation cost; sediment constraint persists; orientation anchored by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sediment layers as recurring micro-setting constrain excavation choices and charge final scrape image, mirroring internal defiance; sensory hierarchy (muck, lamp, canal) reflects POV priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve methods vs. oblivion) signaled early tightens texturally via cog non-fit and "weight of futility," forcing endurance agency; cost legible in solitary prediction "you are all going to drown again."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image offers resonant CR repricing narratives vs. sediment truth without moralizing, reweighting ideology's peril through cog's "ghost mechanism"; theme emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (epistemological parsing of strata/cog); rhythmic control modulates from lecture to resolute scrape; diction reflects philosopher's precision under futility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm propels accumulatively; no loops/artifacts; "teeth still meshed with a ghost mechanism" exemplifies concrete propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh stratigraphic epistemology transforms post-apocalypse trope into preservation calculus; cog synthesis of astronomy/commerce feels inevitable; quiet stasis risks bold solitude without gimmick.</comment>
