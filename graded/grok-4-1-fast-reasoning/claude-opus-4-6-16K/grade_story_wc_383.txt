<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic trait drives contradictory impulses—poetry of science vs. distrust—culminating in earned choice to archive Clara, embodied in sternum warmth and notebook fragments. Final renunciation of full recovery feels motivated by prior causality. No therapy-speak; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shell-listening builds density of echoes to CR closure in dawn image, reweighting loss as architecture with felt cost of deliberate isolation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. Cost legible in "building a life from the wreckage."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden and shell as micro-setting constrain choice (sustained listening) and charge final image (flowers opening as Maren stands). Sensory selectivity (absorbing petals, shell resonance) filters through archivist POV. No white-room; evolves causally to dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct quarantined Clara) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via night-long echoes to notebook tightening that forecloses recovery illusion. Agency in sustained attention/choice; cost unmistakable in "translating isolation into independence." Minor lack of external pressure limits from 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wreckage-as-architecture emerges organically from shell echoes and notebook, answered non-literally in final dawn image reweighting absence. Subtext in copying devotion avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "might have been nothing at all."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with archivist perceptual signature (cathedral scars, logarithmic spiral). Prose texture modulates rhythm from twilight breath to morning cadence; purposeful lyric compression taught early via shell pays off at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/paraphrase; rhythm varies (short dawn sentences propel). Figurative coherence (resonance metaphors) purposeful, not muddy; no artifacts dull closure image of notebook/shell tuck.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh neural-quarantine premise transformed via archivist lens and shell-resonance synthesis; lyric risk heightens stakes in deliberate endurance. No template echoes; final reweighting inevitable from particulars.</comment>
