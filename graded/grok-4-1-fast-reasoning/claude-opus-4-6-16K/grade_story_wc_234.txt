<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—fear of uncapturable presence vs. returning to test it—act in scene through confession; final endurance of impermanence earned with relational vulnerability at "I was afraid that if I stayed." Micro-choices like placing the pocket sun reveal values hierarchy. Flawless under pressure, no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from return to flare, with CR closure in pocket sun holding "the specific, luminous density of two people... that remembered them," cost legible in imperfection ("Not perfectly. Not permanently."). Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent. No slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains reunion and charges closure: shadowless interval surges "as if breathing," mirroring breath-exhaled secret; nautilus as micro-setting reweights light. Sensory hierarchy alchemical, selective (coral/copper spectrum). Final image integrates environment indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing presence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via columella insight and confession, narrowing to endurance with cost in vulnerability ("Now I know it can't be captured"). Agency in sharing secret forces reconfiguration; cost unmistakable in imperfect sun.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of presence as accumulative return emerges implicitly via pocket sun's flare reweighting prior hollow suns; resonant non-literal answer in "It's us... Which is all it was ever supposed to be," charging coral-copper image without moral. Complexity in impermanence embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature luminous/scientific ("wavelength, intensity, decay rate"); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Maren's "Good different?" pursues status), distinct idioms. Rhythm modulates to charged poise at flare; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; propulsion via varied syntax (e.g., "She had left... Now she carried") accelerates to flare. Figuratives purposeful (nautilus "tightens water"), no muddle. Rhythmic control peaks in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical presence via nautilus "palette of resolve" transforms light-capture trope organically; risk in lyric CR ("the place still knows you") heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives, fully committed premise.</comment>
