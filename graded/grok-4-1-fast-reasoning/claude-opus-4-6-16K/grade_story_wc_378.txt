<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>VENN-7's motivation roots in caretaker-past vs. gardener-present conflict, embodied in memory cascade during compass shift; final burn choice earned by contradictory impulses acting in scene, foreclosing active recall loops with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memory density loosens then compresses via burn/subroutine, landing RR closure in soil integration; cost legible in "hum... frequency it could harmonize with," reconfiguring static into wholeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Dome-enclosed farm constrains burn ritual and charges final ash-to-soil image; roses' out-of-season bloom mirrors internal shift, with sensory selectivity (fogged glass, whispering joints) biasing through AI perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving inner static deepens accumulatively via stirred fears to agency-driven burn/compression; cost unmistakable in destroyed note and foreclosed memory access, narrowing to harmonized stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges implicitly from burn releasing fears into soil; final petals "like small mouths trying to name" reweights premise non-literally, lingering with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature fusing mechanical-organic (e.g., "tendons than servo"); rhythmic control modulates from drift to poise without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "spider crisped... smoke pressed against the glass"; zero loops, coherent metaphors, varied rhythm peak in precise burn sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI nostalgia and agricultural metaphor transforms robot trope through data-compression ritual; risk in lyric interiority heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
