<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's grief-defiance contradiction acts in the trembling hands and puppet ritual, earning endurance with the felt cost of "bruised awe." Interiority particular via half-recalled lifetimes and toy's history. Flawless single-POV execution under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to ring shift and puppet alignment as RR/Charged Poise closure, cost legible in "trembling, not from age but from bruised awe." Orientation anchored by para 1; one tightening via micro-degrees recovered suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Panés of hush constrain adjustment by filtering vibration; puppet fracture mirrors clock's, charging final descent image. Sensory hierarchy (visible silence, air pressure) reflects Elara's priorities. Recurrent glass/ocean evolution integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (postpone end via lullaby) signaled early; accumulative deepening via ring advance forces ritual recovery, narrowing to persistence trade-off. Agency in alignment choice; cost embodied in hands trembling at "persistence of small, broken things."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of flawed persistence emerges via fracture resonance, reweighted non-literally in final child-smile image without moralizing. Particulars (puppet, gears) drive resonance; ambiguity lingers in defiance vs. inevitability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases to temporal hush and grief; diction/rhythm modulate from precise mechanism to lyrical close ("lullaby had arrived. It always arrived."). No elision or head-hopping; voice singular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances image/pressure, rhythm varies (short punchy adjustment beats vs. breathing reflections). No loops, coherent metaphors ("glass walls had inhaled"); read-aloud ear flawless at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork doomsday + toy ritual transforms tropes; risk in hush panes/nested recursion inevitable in hindsight, heightening flawed-love stakes without gimmick.</comment>
