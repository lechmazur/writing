<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's illustrator traits drive precise micro-choices like loosening the clapper and sketching mid-time-slow; interior contradiction emerges in observation vs. intervention at paddle strike, earning the shift to uncaging with embodied time-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from mapping to silence-vibration; CR closure lands cleanly in echo dispersal and realization—"orphans of silence"—with legible cost in pendant cooling and rising canals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals constrain paddling and timing, charging final ripple image; selective sensory details like "jade-colored water" and frozen canal-bat filter through illustrator's eye, evolving with giant's stir.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture echo birth tightens via planned silence into uncaging reversal, driven by agency; cost unmistakable in borrowed time's stutter and quickening giant breath under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence birthing sound emerges organically from interrupted cadence to final illustration; resonant CR reweights premise without statement, lingering in "first natural history illustration of silence giving birth to sound."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in precise observations like "fiddlehead ferns"; rhythmic prose modulates from honey-slow to furious sketching, no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in lines like "translucent shapes, curled like fiddlehead ferns, unspooled"; zero loops, varied rhythm accelerates to climax without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-orphans, time-sculpting pendant, and giant-tide world feels inevitable; risk in intervention transforms tropes, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
