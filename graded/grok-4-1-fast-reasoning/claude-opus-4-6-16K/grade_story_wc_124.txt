<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied fear of grief's "full unraveling," shown in contradictory caution versus seeking the bloom; final weeping earned by vial uncapping under prior buildup of avoidance. Dr. Lien's line adds subtle pressure without dominating. Minor articulation in epiphany ("scent bypasses every defense") borders diagnostic but ties to concrete sensory trigger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure in vial uncapping and capping ("It was enough"), with emotional cost legible in "full unraveling" and reconfiguration of grief as completion. Single scene oriented instantly ("greenhouse... Conservatory of Lost Flora"). No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>UV chamber's "purple-black light" and "crystal shadows" constrain climax by revealing vial's "ghostly amber," charging final image; scents filter through Elara's bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under urgency. Recurrent extinct plants pressure choices via ambush risk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront scent-triggered grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bloom sighting and uncapping, narrowing to full agency in weeping; cost unmistakable in "weeping... unable to stop," foreclosing restraint. One decisive deepening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory's limbic bypass emerges organically from vial, bloom, and grief; final "trace of fragrance lingered... It was enough" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in "echo carried in molecules" reweights particulars. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("aromatically cautious," scent as "white petals and green stems") stable in single close-third POV; rhythm modulates to intensity in uncapping beat. Brief Dr. Lien dialogue natural, subtextual. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "The greenhouse filled with a scent... White petals and green stems and honey warmth" layers sense and memory without loops; rhythm varies, figurative purposeful (e.g., "rivers mapped on skin"). Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct botany, UV revelation, and maternal scent transforms grief trope; risk in lyric accumulative closure ("letting her mother return... as an echo") heightens stakes organically. Lantern broker inflects light motif non-obviously. No derivative echoes.</comment>
