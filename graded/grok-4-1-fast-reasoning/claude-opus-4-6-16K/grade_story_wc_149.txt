<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via stirring memories not hers, embodied in bead's warmth and soul loosening; final whisper earns change with cost of bride's departure. Contradictory grief/memory impulses act in scene through speaking to air amid pruning/alchemy. Single-POV excellence with flawed forgetting driving struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visitations build density to pattern break (full bride), RR closure in bead cooling/greenhouse blooming as debt paid, cost legible in "alone and not alone" and thinning darkness. Orientation anchored early (inheritance/greenhouse). No lens ambiguity; persistent bead constraint shapes payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Alchemical details (mercury pomegranates, luminescent sap) selectively sensory, POV-filtered via tending/pruning, constrain stay/remember and charge final blooming image. Endless night presses like breathing barrier, mirroring internal thawing. Evolving environment (brighter post-closure) ties to stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remembering repaid love) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lengthening appearances/full face to climax touch; Maren's narration agency tightens, foreclosing forgetting with bride-loss cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending. One decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial love/debt emerges via particulars (visitations loosening calcified soul), reweighted non-literally in final smile/bead cold as "debt paid." Subtext in ghostly yearning, no moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "alone and not alone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (alchemical bias: fruit bleeding/living light); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed appearances to eruptive climax. Whisper dialogue natural/subtextual. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short eruptive sentences at peak); purposeful alchemical metaphors consistent, no muddle/loops. Final line recharges "winter-cracked fields" motif. Zero scaffold, read-aloud ear flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical orchard ghosts lifetimes debt via grounded orchard-tending choices; risk in accumulative haunt transforms trope organically. Final thinning darkness inevitable synthesis. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
