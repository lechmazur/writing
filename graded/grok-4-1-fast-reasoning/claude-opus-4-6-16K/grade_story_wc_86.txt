<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular via the drawer pull as "instruction" against her father's drowning remorse; contradictory impulses (transactional coldness vs. sacred reverence) act in her proposal and handling of the object. Final endurance of purpose with felt cost (heavy heartbeat) is earned by prior causality. Minor reflection block anchors tightly to present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to moon proposal tightening stake, yielding Charged Poise closure ("nine days to decide whether sorry means anything") with conceptual cost legible in the final valley image reweighting repair possibilities. Single scene, orientation anchored early (parapet climb), no lens ambiguity. Persistent drawer pull constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist and wind concretely constrain (urging back, curling edges, swallowing drop), filtering through Maren's priorities; drawer pull as micro-setting charges final pocket image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under negotiation urgency; spatial choreography coherent. Final mist "closing like a door" mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (acknowledgment via Grosz exchange) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via moon proposal forcing Dashev's recognition and trade-off (untether from clocks/war). Agency in Maren's chart and "timing" insistence forecloses manipulated schedules with legible cost (nine-day wait). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recycling remorse into neutral wisdom emerges organically from particulars (drawer pull evolution, moon as unowned territory), reweighting apology via final "furrowed hush" image without moralizing. Subtext in silence and Dashev's lion glance carries complexity; resonant non-literal close ties arc to "might... be repaired."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Maren-limited POV with perceptual signature (reverent spaces, mechanical distrust); rhythmic control modulates from thoughtful ascent to terse dialogue peaks. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("statement is not acknowledgment"), distinct voices (Maren precise, Dashev quiet). No head-hopping; elision of war details paid off in proposal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., mist "swallowing the drop" advances atmosphere/causality); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops/artifacts even in reflective beats. Figurative language patterned (mist/hush motifs) without muddle; precise syntax propels to charged final image untouched by slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moon-phase sync transforms negotiation trope into fresh celestial neutrality; drawer pull recycles failure organically into tactic/object crucible. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via mist motifs without gimmickry; inevitable hindsight from "neutral territory" premise.</comment>
