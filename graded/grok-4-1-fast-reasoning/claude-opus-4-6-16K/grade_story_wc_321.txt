<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ardent traits compel her isolation-endurance and radio initiative, shown in "polishing brass on a ghost ship" and final poise; contradictory optimism amid crew quits and voices' fear acts in-scene without alternation. Interiority particular via "hum travel through her palms and into her sternum." Earned change in carrying rhythm forecloses erasure path with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of vanishings patterns to grotto junction, cadence shift via humming merges timelines (RR/Charged Poise). Closure costs legible in "city that was one city now, stitched from many" and recovered eleven minutes. Orientation anchors by para 2; experimental shard transitions legible early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spectral grotto's quartz ledge and phosphorescent stalactites constrain stepping off/picking hourglass; fractal stars charge final harbor reassembly image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: diesel rag optimism to light-drips. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal rhythm without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert collision via merge) signaled in vanishings, tightens via voices' layers to humming cadence under Accumulative lens; agency in radio/holding to stars forecloses collision. Cost felt in her solo burden and merged city's subtle reconfiguration. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of showing-up-as-miracle emerges from particulars: ghost-ship polishing to hourglass rhythm in chest, reweighting transient crossings as permanent. Final image non-literal answers erasure question via glowing locker proof. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in stitched city's unknowability to passengers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: optimistic noticing in "rag that smelled like diesel and optimism" to intuitive "understand a song before words." Lyrical rhythm modulates pressure, elision purposeful in pattern-taught spirals. Radio dialogue natural/subtextual, advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "clocks ran sideways" advances causality/atmosphere). Varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative spirals coherent/pattern-taught, no muddle in peak humming beat. Clean mechanics, read-aloud natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: timeline interference via ferry rhythms, star-intervals as frequency transforms vanishing trope organically. Risky fractal grotto pays off in braided closure; inevitable hindsight from persistent showing-up pattern heightens stakes.</comment>
