<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (dangerous yet gentle) act in scene via disciplined cradling of Oren's grief, earning the closure choice to speak "Dahra" with visible cost of willing sorrow-carrying; interiority concrete and embodied ("despair soak into her like rain"). Minor abstract summary in purpose statement slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions densify from tessera touch to name-reading, culminating in on-page RR (Charged Poise via speaking "Dahra," loosening pull with felt cost of "heart full of...sorrow she carried willingly"); single scene, orientation anchored early in plaza post-fire.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stones constrain sequential choices and charge final image (light on blue tiles "almost alive," next stone pull); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (tessera chips over sky), integrated via tactile handling; recurring object-as-micro-setting recharges premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release trapped pasts via precise empathy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening vision (Oren's hidden name) forcing stance crystallization in speaking act; agency forecloses evasion path with legible cost in retained grief under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (structured empathy as revolution) emerges organically from particulars (tessera grief to spoken name), final image resonantly reweights "wounds...become architecture" without moralizing; subtext in "aberrant mercy" invites complexity via counter-reading of hollowing cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (history via chipped glazes); rhythmic modulation builds to peak ("Dahra" echo across plaza); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., short punchy "Dahra." vs. flowing visions); figurative layering purposeful and pattern-taught without muddle; minor density overload in opening sky description edges below flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition-as-empathy with tessera name-puzzle transforms trope into inevitable "renaming silence back into sound"; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via trapped-sliver cost without gimmickry.</comment>
