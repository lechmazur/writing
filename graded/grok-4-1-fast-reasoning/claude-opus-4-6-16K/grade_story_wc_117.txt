<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior conflict between patience and helplessness embodies via adaptive playing and locket gift, earning Wren's speech; contradictory impulses act in the totality beat where music stops for pulse. Wren revealed through actions like beetle-watching and wrist-grab, not labels. Final renunciation of doubt forecloses helplessness with relational cost on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: music density builds to eclipse totality, culminating in Charged Poise RR as Wren links rhythms, reweighting voice-loss premise; cost legible in "rough and unused" whisper. Single scene, orientation anchored by opening climb/locket. No lens ambiguity, closure cost undeniable in singing reprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sage ridge and dreaming roots constrain ascent and anchor voice-hiding metaphor, charging final sway/image; sensory pewter light, temp drop, sage rustle filter through Elara's priorities, narrowing to pulse at totality. Eclipse corona as recurring object recharges locket strands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore voice) signaled in helplessness fear, tightens accumulatively via Wren's turns toward sound then totality link, forcing endurance trade-off; agency in adaptive strums, cost felt in paused music yielding whisper. Escalation peaks on-page without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically from music/pulse/sky thread, reweighting miracle doubt in final singing without moralizing; locket reprise offers non-literal answer to wonder's persistence. Minor slip in ending's explicit "ordinary magic" articulation borders echo but integrates via prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elara's perceptual rhythm/music signature; diction modulates from mellow chords to terse totality silence. Wren's "Mama... Play again?" natural, subtext-laden; no head-hopping, elision none.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm accelerates to totality hush then breathes in singing; no loops, metaphors purposeful (sunflower turn, dreaming roots) without muddle. Minor thickness in opening metaphors but pattern-taught, propels accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eclipse-music therapy synthesis transforms healing trope via pulse-link specificity and ordinary magic CR; quiet closure risks bold poignancy, inevitable from ridge devotion. Fresh "beneath dreaming roots" frame anchors universal stakes particularly.</comment>
