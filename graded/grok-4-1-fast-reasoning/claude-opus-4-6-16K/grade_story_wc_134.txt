<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's admission "I don't see anything" embodies vulnerability tied to her foresight trait; final laughter reveals contradictory impulses resolving into present embrace with visible emotional cost. Sable's presence forces relational micro-choices that deepen Maren's arc. Internal conflict acts in scene via felt blindness amid cave stimuli.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure; pearl placement decisively reconfigures Maren's sight with cost legible in "every note Maren had ever missed while looking ahead." Single continuous scene fits defaults; orientation anchored by cave mouth in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystals, bioluminescence, and shadows constrain perception and charge final image, e.g., "shadows converged on the pearl, folding over it like hands cupping a flame." Sensory details filter through Maren's blinded POV, mirroring internal shift. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance to center.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of foresight silenced escalates texturally via shadow presences and pearl's intensification, narrowing to present-seeing with agency in endurance/observation. Cost unmistakable in sternum ache and laughter amid reconfiguration. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Present-over-future theme emerges via particulars like water droplets and shadow forces; final "ordinary, unpredictable, luminous life" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting foresight premise. Subtext in Sable's "Nobody does. That's the point" lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Maren-specific perceptual signature, e.g., "shadows not as absences but as presences." Dialogue natural/subtextual advances stakes; rhythm syncs to cave's song modulating intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, e.g., "The cave sang a chord that contained every note Maren had ever missed"; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; purposeful metaphors integrate without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of musical cave and living shadows transforms clairvoyant trope via textural accumulation; "pearl pulsed gently... shadows overlapped and breathed" risks lyric reconfiguration heightening stakes organically. Feels inevitable from setup particulars.</comment>
