<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's haunting optimism and weaving trait drive her conscious entry and map-making, with contradictory peace amid town fear embodied in her childhood memory and final speech; earned change forecloses fear-based precedents with communal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via layered revelations (plate discovery → path confirmation → sewn map), with RR closure in "precedents broke like tide pools draining"; orientation anchored early, but heavy reflection slightly diffuses on-page causality at sewing/hanging pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red canyon, tar-stained fingers, lavender thread, and foot-worn grooves vividly constrain choices (lantern walks, timed entries) and charge final image of red dust on feet; sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's optimistic bias, mirroring ruin-to-reverence arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframe labyrinth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via path mapping that narrows options against town precedent; agency in sewing forces trade-off, with cost legible in town hall silence before followers emerge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as devotion emerges organically from paths, plate, and tapestry without moralizing; final image of harbormaster's daughter reprices curse as communion, reweighting particulars with orchid-like ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature of rhythmic optimism ("light was doing" in wreckage); diction/rhythm modulate from haunting unease to defiant solace, charging closure without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful motifs (tide pools, orchids, lavender); no loops or artifacts dull propulsion, metaphors cohere (labyrinth as loom/cathedral), propelling to charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sleepwalkers' unconscious pilgrimage into sewn revelation transforms curse trope; risk in explicit reverence-carving speech heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via path erosion.</comment>
