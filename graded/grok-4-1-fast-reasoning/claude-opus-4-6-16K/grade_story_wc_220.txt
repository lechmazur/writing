<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in terror of dead feeling closer than living, compelling the shift from body-finding to daughter-seeking; decoding fragments embody desperate longing with micro-choices like needle-to-wire progression. Final departure earns change via prior causality. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of decoded fragments ("Mama...come") tightens to full sentence, driving Charged Poise closure in departure with felt cost of abandoning retirement. Orientation anchored early (Maren in Grieve). No ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grooves as "terrain" constrain decoding choice and charge final image; scrapyard hums tactilely through action (borrowing lens, firelight tracing). Sensory hierarchy (copper dust, roaring hiss) reflects bloodhound bias. Environment evolves to propel exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hear daughter's voice, bridge distance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragment-deepening to "come find me"; agency in packing/walking forecloses retirement path with legible emotional cost. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of translating absence to presence emerges via groove-reading and leaf-glow reprise, reweighting dead/living expertise without statement; final image answers "come" non-literally through charged walk. Complexity in mad science lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (grooves as "impossibly fine spirals...architecture of tin") biases noticing; rhythmic compression under desperation stays consistent. Stable single POV, no elision or head-hopping; voice modulates to propel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density (groove-mapping compresses months into beats); zero loops, varied rhythm (short decoding sentences vs. lush settlement hum). Figuratives purposeful ("fossil in stone"), no muddle or scaffold in peak decode/closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: bloodhound terrain-reading applied to phonograph grooves transforms post-apoc trope; departure reweights premise freshly. Risk in mad decoding pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
