<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in avoidance of grief via stars over stones, embodied in hand on daylily; final acceptance earned by dream recurrence and writing choice with emotional cost. No unearned epiphanies; impulses act simultaneously in pivot from telescope to letter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from telegram to stars analogy to dream realization, culminating in on-page RR (dream hands accepted, stone lighter but shared—cost in non-disappearance). Single scene coherent; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory micro-setting (red lamp, curved walls, Cygnus field) filters through astronomer's bias, constraining realization via binaries; daylily charges final image as mother's hand. Sensory purposeful: fog erases, sweetness defies time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unshared grief) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via temple-stars-dream linkage narrowing to writing/acceptance; agency in witnessing self forces trade-off, cost legible in lighter-but-present stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shared burdens emerges from particulars (binaries' geometry, dream figures, prayers); final image reweights premise non-literally—stone held between, healing via witness—embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (pulsing rhythms like breathing); rhythmic control modulates from insomnia tension to solace, diction precise (eclipsing binaries as shared burden). No elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short insight sentences amid flow), propulsion peaks in "understanding dawned" beat with concrete propulsion to closure image. Final line recharges motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes astronomy, archaeology, dreams into fresh grief frame; variable stars transform binaries into burdens ingeniously, risk in lyric closure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
