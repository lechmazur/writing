<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in private ritual versus responding to Dao's echoing youth tremor, earning the shift to intervention; micro-choices with nib reveal values hierarchy, with isolation's cost felt in breaking silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as phone call density builds reflective proof by contradiction to Charged Poise closure in sealing envelope; "truth...descending toward a mailbox" delivers legible conceptual cost without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Echoing dome and clouds constrain isolation, charging telescope turn to valley lights; "clouds shifted like slow tides" mirrors internal reconfiguration in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Journalist call deepens dominant stake of silence versus revelation, forcing renunciation of privacy; envelope-sealing forecloses orbit with felt isolation cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Mathematics never lied" reweights omission's orbits non-literally against stars' "constancy"; resonance emerges from logbook particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Astronomical perceptual signature ("orbits of regret") biases details consistently under pressure; rhythmic control heightens decision without distance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action ("nib scratched. The dome echoed") with propulsion; no loops or muddled figures dull peak proof beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Astronomy-as-media-ethics synthesis feels inevitable; "proof by contradiction" inflects regret's moral calculus boldly without gimmickry.</comment>
