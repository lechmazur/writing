<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under weather pressure, like climbing down despite gale, reveal sculptor-specific motives; final reimagination earned by prior interpretive actions. Mild flaw: idealized without sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via slide tilts revealing layered alliances; CR closure in sculpture reimagining reweights premise with conceptual cost legible in "understood the question it was asking." Orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archway and slide as micro-settings constrain choices (climb, tilt) and charge final mirror image; sensory hierarchy (hum, spray) filtered through sculptor's bias toward grain and curves. Vivid, purposeful integration elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake (learn from detour for art) signaled early, textural deepening via slide's generations narrows to structural insight with agency in interpretation; cost felt in foreclosed "single figure" sculpture. One tightening sufficient, coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of timewoven bonds emerges organically from slide's tilts, resonating in final archway image without statement; reweights alliances as "lattice of trust" with ambiguity in future formations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (curves, grain) biasing notice; rhythmic diction modulates from gale urgency to melodic ease, prose as character in sculptural metaphors. No slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wind threaded through the gap with a steady, resonant hum"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts dulling propulsion or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magic slide's living alliances transform ruin trope into fresh time-lattice insight; bold synthesis of sculpture and history feels inevitable, risk in magical realism pays off without gimmick.</comment>
