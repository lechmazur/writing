<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory grief/wonder impulses embodied in "haunted euphoria" and gentle method act simultaneously; final endurance of covenant's weight earned by methodical choices with personal cost parallel to town's forgetting. Interiority particular via archival details like walnut ink recipe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to fragment surfacing ("letters surfaced") as tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure where covenant "breathes" with emotional cost in knees aching/heart full. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming vines' fragrance and fading light constrain work (ink catches "last amber light") and charge final image ("jetty bloomed...covenant breathed"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (professional + haunted). Micro-setting (planks) causes knee ache cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covenant regeneration vs. engineered forgetting) signaled early, deepens texturally as sabotage evidence interleaves and fragment lifts, narrowing to her refusal; cost legible in funding parallel and bodily ache charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of small promises vs. context-change emerges implicitly from regeneration events; final image ("covenant breathed") non-literally reweights promise's persistence without moral, lingering ambiguity on legal weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close 3rd POV stable with perceptual signature in archival precision ("photographed each fragment with archival precision") and coined diction ("haunted euphoria"); rhythm modulates from reflective to charged closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., fragment bath to surfacing in one fluid beat); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; figurative coinages purposeful without muddle in peak (ink catching light).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival restoration as mercy-revival on-site transforms trope of forgotten history; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes via proximate method, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
