<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—obsession vs. unraveling—act in scene via embodied calm ("trembled only slightly") and micro-choices like ignoring food; final fever broken earned by causal build of exhaustion and Jun's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of threads/memories builds to Charged Poise closure ("The room breathed. The threads held."); cost legible in "trembled with the weight," reconfiguring dream/blueprint sequence without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gallery's Escher details and threads constrain weaving and charge cocoon moment ("threads pressed against his skin"); recurring sinew as micro-setting mirrors internal fragility, filtering through architect's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing connection's texture) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via exhaustion and "erupted" micro-turn; agency in endurance forecloses unraveling with legible cost in final trembling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connection emerges organically from sinew/dream particulars; final image non-literally answers via "almost, almost, almost understood," reweighting rational enchantment with conceptual fragility cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in architectural metaphors ("connective tissue between thoughts"); stable close-third POV with biased noticing (illusions as feelings); Jun's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("staircases folded into themselves"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent/coherent, charging peak ("cocoon of translucent geometry").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cod sinew in illusion gallery transforms architecture trope; risk in blurring memory/dream heightens stakes, inevitable in "realistically imaginary" closure image.</comment>
