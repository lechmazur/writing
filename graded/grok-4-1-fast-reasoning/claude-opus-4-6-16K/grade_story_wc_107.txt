<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contemplative glassblower's interiority shines in glass-filtered perceptions and contradictory impulses—narrating for lightness yet confronting past abandonment; final "She decides" earns renunciation with embodied cost in bookmark pat and sensor reconnection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ice droplets to sensor data and personal thaw, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure in "She begins," reweighting abandonment with cost of deliberate freeze now thawed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory micro-setting (weeping ice threads, thermos scent, fluorescent flicker) filters through glassblower bias, constraining choices via failing panels and dripping time; final water "keeping time" charges image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (craft inquiry amid melt) signaled early tightens texturally via sensor reveal ("point-four degrees"), forcing endurance choice; cost legible in foreclosed despair/abandonment, though internal more than external pressure limits peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thawing-as-softening theme emerges organically from ice/heart/glassblowing particulars, culminating in resonant non-literal answer: "inquiry itself is a form of glassblowing"; ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (light-bent droplets, molten worlds); voice modulates from theatrical narration to quiet truth, rhythmic syntax heightening contemplative pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete idiom ("ice filaments," "thermal cycling warped"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative weave supports closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower in permafrost vault transforms climate inquiry trope via narration method and thawing heart; risk in lyric accumulative mode heightens stakes organically.</comment>
