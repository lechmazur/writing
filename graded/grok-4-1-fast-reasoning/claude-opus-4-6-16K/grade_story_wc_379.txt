<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's discernment as thrift curator roots her motivation compellingly in object-stories, shown via locket handling and neighbor chains; actions align perfectly with traits. Minor slip: no on-page contradictory impulses during the mailbox push, all smooth endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via story density building Dolores' portrait to CR closure in courtyard return and final truth image, with cost legible in Dolores' tears and neighbors' reactions. Orientation anchors firmly in first paragraph's courtyard dawn; backstory shards tilt present choices without flattening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vibrant courtyard details—honey light, fountain murmur, bougainvillea—filter through Maren's listening bias and charge final image, constraining her dawn vigils. Sensory economy perfect, mirroring internal calm without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mailbox via listening) signals early, tightens accumulatively at property notice intrusion forcing off-page action, cohering to ending reconfiguration. Weakness: escalation leans told over on-page pressure, diluting visceral cost legibility despite felt neighbor reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening's healing emerges organically from story accumulation and locket/Dolores payoff, resonant in final courtyard poise. Penalty for final line's direct "listening heals... unheard" as Thematic Echo moralizing, replacing image charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Maren's discarded-object lens and rhythmic prose modulate beautifully with accumulative calm; POV stable, no leakage. Voice specificity elevates dawn imagery without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel smoothly, with read-aloud ear intact in honey light cadences. Minor figurative density overload in descriptive beats ("roots beneath tile," "open like a locked door") risks coherence without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh thrift-curator lens transforms mailbox trope into quiet listening triumph, with courtyard reprise inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric accumulation on community whispers risks sentiment but coheres authentically.</comment>
