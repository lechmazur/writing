<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in Fen's shift from GPS reliance to listening, earned by guidance; Maren's expertise shown through micro-choices like whispering directions, with visible cost in Fen's faltered stride.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm acoustics deepen stakes, leading to Charged Poise closure as Fen unfolds map; cost legible in "He pocketed his phone," reconfiguring options without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Labyrinth acoustics constrain choices (whispers carry, shouts muddle) and charge final image; storm "tuned corridors" narrows perception purposefully, with body/attention hierarchy via sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intuition > tech) signaled early, tightens via discovery deepening knowledge; agency in Maren's endurance forces Fen's trade-off, cost felt in his "tentative, heel-toe" walk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening/intuition emerges via particulars like coin slot and star chart; final image "watching creases reveal" reweights premise non-literally, with lingering ambiguity on maze's agency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Maren's sound-biased perceptual signature; dialogue subtextual ("Your maps are folklore") advances goal; rhythm modulates with storm's hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; varied syntax propels from exposition to peak ("her voice slid... perfect clarity"); "bruise lit from within" coherent, no overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic maze and storm-tuned physics transforms trope; risk in folded maps' mechanics heightens stakes, inevitable in Fen's reconfiguration hindsight.</comment>
