<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Broken-hearted archivist's motivation intensifies through personal file discovery, with embodied emotion peaking when button warms in palm, earning final renunciation of isolation via new archive; contradictory endurance of system flaws shown in dust-reading micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from dust patterns to button discovery, landing CR closure in companion archive decision with legible emotional cost of prior abandonment; orientation anchored in opening lines, single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust sediment as micro-setting constrains file selection and charges final "read the dust" image; tactile details like "cathedral-thick" dust and button's green patina filter through archivist's perceptual bias, evolving with discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unearthing kindness deepens accumulatively at button find, narrowing to renunciation of failure-focus with felt cost of her untouched file; agency in file-handling forecloses isolation path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of buried kindnesses emerges via button's seed-like placement, reweighted in final archive vow without statement; resonant CR ending answers "what someone had tried to do right" through her turned button and next folder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in dust-as-language metaphors; rhythmic prose modulates from clinical observation to charged poise at "seeds waited," no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds, metaphors cohere (dust as snow, seed in soil) without overwriting; propulsion peaks in button's "cold, then warm" sensory shift, varying syntax breathes with revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Civil War button transforms foster file trope into ancestry seed across emancipation gap; fresh synthesis of dust-language archive and unwitnessed care risks quiet CR payoff that hindsight-makes inevitable.</comment>
