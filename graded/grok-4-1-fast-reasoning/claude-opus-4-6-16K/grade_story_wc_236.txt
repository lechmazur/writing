<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and motivation rooted in loss of smell driving intuitive adaptation; chest shift and logbook entry earn endurance with visible cost in foreclosed past life. Contradictory impulses between intuitive past and mechanical present act in repair choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from opening drip rhythm to Charged Poise closure in logbook and door-opening; orientation anchored immediately in shop and fog; cost legible in "rhythm...in her sternum" reweighting loss as endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog, clepsydra, and screw as micro-setting constrain repair choice and charge final drip/logbook image; sensory hierarchy (sound of drops over lost smell) reflects POV bias and mirrors internal occluded clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of meaningful repair post-loss tightens via perfect screw fit, forcing endurance over fraudulence; agency in repurposing forecloses sourcing dead-end with felt emotional cost in sternum rhythm, but stakes lean reflective over visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles and attention-as-sense emerges organically from screw fit and drops, reweighting premise in logbook's non-literal "Water remembers its way down"; resonant without moralizing, charged by occluded views motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature of "reading between lines"; rhythmic control modulates from fog hush to drip cadence under reflective pressure; purposeful compression of backstory enhances texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from screw threading to sternum pulse; metaphors (lock yields, frosted glass) cohere without muddle, elevating closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost smell, birthing screw in clepsydra, and veiled perception transforms quiet repair into humanizing miracle; risk-taking in lyric closure heightens stakes through irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
