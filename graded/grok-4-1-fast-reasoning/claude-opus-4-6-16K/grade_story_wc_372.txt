<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's gently meticulous trait roots motivation and compels precise choices under dissolving-ice pressure; contradictory personal/institutional stakes act in scene via trembling hand at 589nm. Final endurance earned by causal buildup of frequencies to mother's voice, foreclosing oblivion path with emotional cost. No unearned epiphanies; embodied precision distinguishes her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sampled frequencies builds vows toward CR closure in library renewal and descent image, reweighting premise with slide-spent cost legible at "emulsion spent." Orientation anchored early; single scene fits defaults with one tightening at mother's unscripted frequency. No causality breaks; persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice lattice constrains salvage choices via sublimation urgency and hums in resonance, charging final brightening image. Sensory hierarchy (refracting light, still air) filters through Maren's precision bias, integrated into action. 9+ gate met; quartz surfaces mirror internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage vows amid fading illusions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via frequency samplings narrowing to personal revelation that reweights knowledge/cost. Agency in dial turns forces trade-off (slide exhaustion for renewal); mother's voice at 589nm legibly pays emotional price. Escalation coherent under lens; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory/love vs. oblivion emerges organically from luminous vows and final notebook frequency, offering resonant CR without moralizing—"distance between love and oblivion... survivable" reweights particulars. Subtext in unscripted maternal warmth against quartz hush; no tidy binaries, ambiguity lingers in choice to stay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature of meticulous noticing (nanometer dials, weight of drawers); rhythmic control modulates hush to humming resonance under pressure. Diction purposeful (sublimating molecule by molecule); no head-hopping or withholding. Voice as character: syntax mirrors precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "slid the plate... rectangle of amber glow" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm flows read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (filaments like visible song); propulsion peaks at vow assembly without overwriting in climax.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival fantasy via frequency-encoded voices transforms trope; frozen-cloud library and spectral sampler feel inevitable. Risk in solo-POV lyric accumulation heightens personal stakes; no derivative echoes, conceptual integrity to premise implications.</comment>
