<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (deliver vs. linger) act simultaneously in the germination scene, earning the final renunciation; jitteriness embodies as tremor sympathetically vibrating the pendant, compelling the planting choice with visible cost to her courier life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hum to root emergence, culminating in Charged Poise closure as she plants the pendant ("She would not deliver this one"), with legible cost in foreclosed fee and client rage; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora and ridgeway soil constrain the planting choice and charge the final image ("the seed drinking the vibration and the light"); selective sensory hierarchy (shimmering path, humming frequency) reflects courier's jittery priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver relic vs. coax wonder) signaled early, tightens via pendant's sympathetic response narrowing options; agency in renunciation forecloses delivery path with on-page cost ("Let the client rage. Let the fee evaporate"), reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing wonder from routine emerges organically through planting refusal, final image ("hands were still... bone flute playing") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting courier myth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in jittery details ("flinch at every sound," "trembling hands"); rhythmic control modulates from jittery fragments to poised closure, stable close-3rd POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "filaments caught the aurora's shifting green, and the hum rose"); zero loops, varied syntax propels to closure image without figurative muddle or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vibrating relic germinating via personal tremor transforms relic trope; risk in lyric Accumulative closure ("Somewhere beyond memory... approving note") heightens stakes inevitably from established resonance.</comment>
