<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to plant second thoughts is rooted in consistent traits like cradling fragments carefully, intensifying to her grotto installation and final notebook entry. Interiority concrete via precise methods and embodied doubt at close. Final renunciation of fear earned by prior displays' impact, with visible cost in writing her words.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of unspoken words to grotto CR closure, where starlit notebooks reweight her premise with conceptual cost ("I was afraid this wouldn't matter"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via ambitious installation suffices; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto constrains final image by holding notebooks open under starlight, charging closure. Cobalt library and mist selectively mirror internal quiet, integrated via Maren's arrivals. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward unspoken layers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of humble rebellion signaled early, accumulates to grotto recognition forcing her doubt crystallization. Agency in designing displays/installation narrows options with felt social cost (council tension). Escalation via density reweights with town response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of visible unsaid emerges organically from displays to grotto resonance, final notebook reconfiguring self-doubt without moralizing. Subtext in images like tipped queen implies complexity. Protagonist arc inextricable from planting second thoughts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in noticing swallowed words. Prose texture modulates rhythmically, poetic diction voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; compression purposeful under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in images like "forests of second thoughts." No loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent (mist, bruising) without muddle. Propulsion clear, minor figurative density taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hearing unsaid into synchronized displays and grotto transforms rebellion trope. Grotto payoff inevitable from prior particulars. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
