<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with synesthetic embodiment ("burgundy that hummed at a frequency Maren felt in her molars") revealing contradictory motives—grief avoidance via utility—culminating in earned plan to build warning into hearing aid, foreclosing raw reliving with visible weep-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of absences building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("Maren wept... carrying the collected absences back"), with cost legible in final weep and greenhouse sinking another millimeter, reweighting memory as mappable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain recording ("microphones toward the empty spaces between the trees"), aurora/forge charge final image ("forge sat cold beneath the lights, holding the shape of every tool"), mirroring internal perseverance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map trust-breaking frequency) signaled early, deepens decisively via burgundy recognition in Elda's absence, forcing endurance/renunciation (utility over pain) with on-page weep-cost charging closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust/memory as cellular division/perseverance emerges organically via particulars (roots drinking brackish, cells dividing), final image ("memory could finally become useful") offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with distinct perceptual signature ("aurora... faint chord—E minor"), rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in weep beat), purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm ("The wrecks groaned... The aurora sang... The forge sat cold"), no loops/artifacts; figurative layer (colors humming) purposeful without muddling peak recognition beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic absences in shipwreck orchard transforms trust-breaking trope, with bold conceptual risk (frequency as warning aid) inevitable from prior particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
