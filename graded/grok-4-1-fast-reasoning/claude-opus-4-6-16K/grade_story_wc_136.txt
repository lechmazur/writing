<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "trembling certainty" as she squeezes the punch despite lifelong avoidance of grief; final renunciation of maps earned by accumulated mapping as evasion. Interiority particular via cartographic lens on emotions. No therapy-speak flattens peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cracks and maps build to CR closure in final step without maps, cost legible in "rearranges the bones of a life" and undocumenting walk. Orientation anchored early in apartment cracks. Pattern taught, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Starlit vault and mist constrain path and part for corridor, charging final image; cracks as tactile arrows guide choices throughout. Sensory hierarchy cartographic and urgent. Body/tool (punch) as micro-setting bites air pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fortress truths) signaled early, accumulates via crack-following to punch-squeeze tightening; agency in daring squeeze forecloses mapping life with personal cost felt in silhouette approach. No abstract stakes; pressure crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mapping unspoken grief emerges via accumulating particulars (cracks, maps, punch), resonant CR in final undocumenting walk reweighting avoidance without moral. No tidy binary; ambiguity in open corridor lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with cartographer's perceptual signature ("contour line rendered with geometric precision"); rhythmic modulation peaks in punch squeeze. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels: varied syntax/rhythm in "jaw bit through something invisible, and a sound like tearing silk"; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors touch closure. Strategic telling anchors reflection efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography as grief-map to punch-unlocking corridor transforms trope of lost parent; risk in CR ending (living vs. documenting) inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
