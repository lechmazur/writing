<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's spatially imaginative gift roots motivation concretely, with embodied psychometry reading showing contradictory impulses toward revelation vs. stasis. Final renunciation earned by visions' accumulation. No stock epiphanies; traits drive micro-choices like handling the film strip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from booth entry to psychometry cascade to CR closure in "She had been looking at him," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of stored love's endurance. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Projection booth's acetate scent, projectors, rewinding table constrain intimacy of reading; film strip as micro-setting charges final image when lifted to bulb. Sensory details (hushed thunder) mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (love's storage) deepens via psychometry reversal of knowledge, forcing Maren's stance crystallization in decision not to deliver truth. Cost legible in foreclosed path; Accumulative cadence shift reweights without causal break.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love's object-storage emerges organically from letters, visions, booth; final CR image ("projectors... holding everything") offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars like mid-sentence letters avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (sensing grief pooled in corners); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive entry to charged visions. No head-hopping; diction biased toward spatial/emotional architecture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors cohere (hushed thunder, white lake screen) without muddle in peak reading beat. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "eight frames dense as scripture."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh psychometry via film booth transforms unrequited love trope; Eldon's letters as love-transfer synthesis feels inevitable. Risky lyric CR heightens stakes organically.</comment>
