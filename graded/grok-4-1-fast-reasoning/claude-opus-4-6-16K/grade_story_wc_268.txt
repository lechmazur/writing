<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in tactile handling of the ink pellet and patient micro-choices under pressure; motivation rooted in noticing "seams the way rivers noticed stone" compels subtle path without unearned epiphanies. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to rune inscription; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in drifting letters through oculus, with ink depletion as legible cost—"an absence so clean it was its own testimony."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via weeping walls for ink and oculus for dispersal, charging final image; sensory details like "dust that had once been certainty" filter through Cael's priorities, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unmask pretender tightens via depleting ink to final book; agency in subtle annotations culminates in breath-activated rune, with visible cost foreclosing direct confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truthful dissolution emerges organically from rune and drifting forgery; final image of "void where a lie had been" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting false lineage without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mythic noticing ("shadow fell with the gravity of something colossal"); rhythmic diction modulates elegantly, reflecting poised mind under timeless pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "dense as a collapsed star" enhance without muddling climax breath-scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diminutive titan wielding ink as cosmic eraser transforms forgery trope; risk in graceful, non-violent unmasking heightens stakes organically through rune mechanics.</comment>
