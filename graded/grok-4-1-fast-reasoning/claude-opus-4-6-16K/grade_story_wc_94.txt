<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in self-redaction vs. uncensored sob earned by prior buildup; final writing choice forecloses self-censorship path with embodied cost in "raw syllable of a sob". Interiority concrete via father's hands and her scars. Minor label-speak in "self-betrayal" but anchored to micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: timer ticking builds density to CR closure in photo reveal and writing, reweighting self-erasure premise with undeniable emotional cost in "indistinguishable from thunder". Orientation anchored early in climb and dome. Single scene causality tight, no micro turns needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storm-lit dome and clouds constrain vigil (altitude rarefies grief, hums with lightning) and charge final sob amplification. Sensory selection POV-biased toward scars/maps. Micro-object (timer) evolves to guide reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront self-erasure) signaled early, deepens via timer/photo under Accum lens; agency in setting timer/writing forecloses redaction path. Cost legible in sob foreclosing pretense. One tightening sufficient, charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of scarred maps vs. unredacted truth emerges via particulars; photo's "Don't look away" non-literally answers in writing on timetable, reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonance from father's landscapes to her poem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poet's perceptual signature (scars, rarefy, atlas); rhythmic lyricism modulates to peak stress in "sob that the dome amplified". No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors like "wound in the sky" and "second ocean" densifies reflective beats without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of self-censorship vigil and maternal photo at telescope transforms grief tropes; timer/photo/bus timetable inevitable in hindsight, risks lyric altitude for charged poise.</comment>
