<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via telepathy and stains, with contradictory impulses (silence vs. truth) driving the pen-lifting choice; flaws like irrational methods balance competence, earning the final renunciation of erasure with imperial cost felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensations/research density deepens to Charged Poise closure ("She picked up her pen. She would not let the shepherd vanish"); orientation anchored in opening paragraph, cost legible in violin's fading glow and empire-crack stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet observatory and ice violin constrain via chill on jasmine and starlight refraction, charging final note; sensory hierarchy (cold pressure, stain patterns) filters through Luelle's bias, evolving with dimming promise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. empire) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via stain/jasmine/violin inputs narrowing to write-or-silence; agency in pen-grasp forecloses silence with on-page cost of narrative crack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perforated destiny theme emerges organically from shepherd theft and propagation, resonant non-literal close in violin's "faint, clear note, thin as grief" reweighting stolen promise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (plant murmurs, stain-reading); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from ache to resolve, compression purposeful and pattern-taught via refracting images.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied syntax; minor figurative density ("destiny... riddled with holes") fits accumulative voice without muddle, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic botany, stain divination, glacial artifact transforms provenance trope; risk in lyric fantasy blend inevitable via shepherd-imperial pivot.</comment>
