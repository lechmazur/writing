<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (drumming on aching sternum reveals pain-tied rebellion); motivation compels escalating choices to manifestation with earned endurance cost at lagoon edge. Contradictory impulses in clinical rebellion vs. destabilization risk act in scene. Final heartbeat syncopation feels earned by prior micro-choices; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drumming density cascades to lagoon RR (Charged Poise) with sorrow-cost legible in "auroral sorrow... waited for the universe to exhale." Orientation anchored early (Maren in garden at night). Single scene tightens meaningfully without slips; closure reconfigures entanglement premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden setting constrains/enables: crystalline stalks, basin rim shape drumming tactics, manifesting lagoon as final image charge. Sensory synesthesia (vibrations to violet arches, golden light) POV-filtered via Maren's neural output. Body as micro-setting (bare feet in frequencies, palm on lagoon) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge entanglement vs. severance) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density (drumming → patterns → lagoon reflection) narrowing to heartbeat answer with grief-cost. Agency in persistent drumming forecloses isolation path. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of entanglement-as-bridge emerges organically from shared geometries, dream-shore manifestation answering "error or bridge?" via final syncopation without moralizing. Subtext in reflection's independent eyes layers complexity. Closing image reweights premise with threshold-cost resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature ("sound waves became architecture") modulates rhythmically with drumming intensity; single POV stable, no leakage. Compression taught early pays off in charged closure. Diction biased to Maren's rebellious attunement (humming stalks as sympathetic).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm mirroring beats (short heartbeat drum vs. spiraling cascades); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs. Final line "Answering" recharges motifs cleanly. Zero artifacts dull peak manifestation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-garden physics manifests neural entanglement as tactile dream-bridge, transforming amnesia-cure trope via synesthetic closure. Risky lyric sci-fi coheres boldly; no derivatives, inevitable hindsight from particulars.</comment>
