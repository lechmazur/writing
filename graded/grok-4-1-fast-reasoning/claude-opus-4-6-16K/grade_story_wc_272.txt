<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (reconciling vs. letting fragments exist separately), earning final endurance of open box with cost; embodied grief (luminous ache) particular and under pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("redesigned her perception") redeemed by immediate thread action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from portraits to web to redesign, cadence shift reconfigures walls' meaning in final image with conceptual cost of held-open fractures. Closure as Charged Poise legible on-page; orientation anchored early (lighthouse climb, box).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt-warped books and pinned threads constrain choices (web as method) and charge final descent with box. Micro-setting (box, walls) mirrors internal shift, selective sensory (bronze light, frayed threads) purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix warped perception) signaled early, deepens via threads as data forcing redesign agency; cost in foreclosed reconciliation felt in open box. Accumulative tightening reweights options without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation as data emerges organically from thread web and portraits, final image ("container that could not contain") resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (wrongness as loss-warped sight) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates with intensity (short sentences in redesign). Stable close third-person, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (lines multi-job: advance insight/action); varied rhythm, no loops or muddled metaphors ("hollow tooth," "lens focuses light" coherent). Minor density in metaphors purposeful for lyric build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot threads as perceptual method transforms artist-trope in lighthouse frame; risk in accumulative lyric risks heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
