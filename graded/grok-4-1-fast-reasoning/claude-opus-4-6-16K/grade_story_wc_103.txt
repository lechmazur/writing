<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority embodied in visions and bare feet on roots; motivation intensifies from drowning pasts to mapping time, earning closure realization with fading photos as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragment discovery to maze redesign; CR closure at "She closed her eyes and let the curvature carry her" reconfigures entrapment with legible cost in dissolving photo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bridge garden roots constrain grafting and charge final image; hyperbolic paths mirror internal curvature, evolving causally through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to map time tightens via redesign agency; photo disintegration delivers visible cost, reweighting under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image answers texture question non-literally: time as "fibrous and branching" reweights premise from trap to navigation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with geometric perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation from disorientation to reverie supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density without loops, e.g., "time split open like a fig"; varied rhythm propels to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry synthesis transforms time-vision trope; bold premise integration feels inevitable at CR.</comment>
