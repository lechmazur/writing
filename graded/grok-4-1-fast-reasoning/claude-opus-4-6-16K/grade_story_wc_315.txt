<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal revision choice earned by Cassin training and contradictory impulses to report vs contextualize; shaking hands embody post-decision cost without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from anomaly spotting to reframed report; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with cost legible in "hands shaking" and waiting image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor and parachute buckle constrain isolation-driven vigilance, charging final spine-against-heartwood image; selective sensory hierarchy (stars/clouds) reflects pattern-seeker POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Anomaly detection tightens to revision agency under Accumulative lens, foreclosing strike-team option with runner dispatch; cost unmistakable in shaking hands post-call.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Burden of "knowledge without context" emerges organically, final log-entry/waiting reweights vigilance as "caring enough to watch well" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pattern-seeker perceptual signature ("rhythm older than words") holds stably, modulating rhythm through stress; radio dialogue carries precise subtext advancing stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors (clouds as "frozen ocean"); syntax varies to propel buckle ritual to shaking release cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tree-perched pattern-seeker premise synthesizes sci-fi vigilance with muscle-memory ritual, transforming isolation into trust calculus with fresh, inevitable closure.</comment>
