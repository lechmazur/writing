<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira's burn scar and poetry mourning embody motivation with contradictory impulses (preserve vs coexist); micro-choice to turn and close eyes earns final widening of the line. Prophet's eyes reveal accumulation understanding. Voice distinct in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from consecration to dialogue reconfigures tension in Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "wide enough for company" image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Murmuring columns and parapet constrain ritual and charge final hum; vibrations in bones and sand spirals filter through Lira's peripheral bias, evolving causally to whisperfield.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echoes) signaled early, deepens via prophet's arrival forcing dialogue test; agency in spirals forecloses erasure with clearings holding as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coexistence theme emerges from clearings holding "curious" old voices alongside new rain; final image reweights accumulation without moral, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Lira-limited POV with peripheral perceptual signature; dialogue subtextual ("walk the line") advances goal; rhythmic modulation from hum to whisper under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sense/action (spirals "gather in corners"); varied rhythm propels to closure whisper without loops or muddled metaphors like "cupped hands."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory parapet and conjured silences transforms prophecy trope; risk in "honest deception" heightens coexistence stakes organically.</comment>
