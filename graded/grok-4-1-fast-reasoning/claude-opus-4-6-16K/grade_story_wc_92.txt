<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Maren's outward "practiced indifference" versus inner "small fire banked and waiting," compelling the final endurance of secrecy with visible cost in her bewildered facade. Competence balanced by patient risks like the three-month solvent. Final spark-catching reconfigures her stance, earned by causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: solvent pour → blackout → sundial-guided escape → post-return. Closure as Charged Poise RR in "a spark caught and held," with conceptual cost of irreversible revolution legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (Maren at gatehouse, Fort Solenne, autumn twilight). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phosphorite channels and blackout constrain choices, charging escape tactics; sundial as micro-setting enables coordination and reweights in retrieval beat. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (key "clicks" conspiratorial). Final dark dissolution mirrors internal spark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spark revolution) tightens via blackout trigger, narrowing to quarter-hour window; agency in freeing prisoners forecloses exposure path with felt risk in commander's demand. Causal escalation forces micro-choices; cost in "irreversible moment" and calm return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nested meanings/subtle rebellion emerges organically from sundial cipher, quill symbolism, and "wink and a hush"; final "silent revolution breathed its first breath" reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via sparks motif constraining closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (keys "turned...the way other people turned thoughts"); diction/rhythm modulates tension (short clicks vs. patient solvent reveal). Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("You'll need this where you're going"). No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "solvent was slow, patient, cumulative, like Maren herself"). Varied rhythm propels (long setup breathes, escape accelerates); zero loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Closure image crisp, no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial cipher and phosphorite sabotage transform prison-break trope into inventive hush; quill holder reprise risks bold subtlety, heightening stakes via secrecy cost. Non-obvious synthesis of vigilance-as-rebellion feels inevitable in "spark caught and held."</comment>
