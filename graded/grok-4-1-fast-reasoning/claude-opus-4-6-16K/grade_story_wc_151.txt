<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Maren's inventive naming for others while seeking her own explanatory sentence in margins; final endurance of endless search earned via letter process. Flaw of perpetual looking without finding drives stasis with felt cost. Voice specificity elevates beyond stock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through four letters toward Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early (arcade, dawn workers, job by para 2). Cost legible in "Still hers. Still revisable" before bell seals it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Golden light, defunct fountain, ebony clipboard constrain actions (clipboard on edge, clips cards) and charge final image with liturgical dawn. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: chalk codes, margin details over broad vista. Micro-setting (clipboard) reweights ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (margin meaning before seal) signaled early, tightens texturally via deepening margins across letters. Cadence shift at final envelope forces renunciation; cost in "She never found it" unmistakable. Single intensification fits length/lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of physical slowness carrying weight emerges implicitly from chalk spies, margin dives, name bridges; final image reconfigures with her unfound sentence amid mailed belief. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature: name rhythms ("weight, rhythm"), margin "compass" bias distinct. Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at end. No elision/head-hopping; compression purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density (e.g., "spiral inside a square meant romantic" packs world/margin insight). Rhythm varies, propels accumulatively; no overwriting in peak (final margins). Read-aloud liturgical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pseudonym craft in 2089 mail underground fresh synthesis; chalk spies transform postal trope organically. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes via nostalgia without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from margins to bell.</comment>
