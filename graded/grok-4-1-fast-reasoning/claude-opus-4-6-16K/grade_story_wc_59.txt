<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Edric's motivation to reawaken beauty roots deeply in contradictory tenderness toward the mechanical world he hates, shown through embodied ache and journal hypotheses; final release earns change via prior obsession's costs like diverted power. Interiority particularizes flaws in "beauty was not precision but fracture."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: egg sparks density build to song's pattern break and CR closure in "gear skipped... sounded like music," reweighting mechanical perfection with conceptual cost legible in palace shudder. Orientation anchors early in palace/stalactite imagery; single tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via suspended workshop's power diversion groaning anchors and platform edge forcing release choice; stalactite "dying chandelier" charges final flight image. Sensory integration mirrors internal fracture vs. symmetry through steam/gears vs. spiral egg.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty vs. mechanism) tightens accumulatively through flawed bird's song evoking "rain on warm stone," narrowing to release with agency in open hands; cost felt in stuttering flight and unchallenged gear skip reconfiguring world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as "world's refusal to be only what it was designed to be" emerges organically from egg's spiral to bird's imperfect flight, resonating in final gear-skip image without statement. Particulars like "bitterly sweet" melody reweight mechanical premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in fracture-obsessed noticing (e.g., "asymmetric oval with faint ridge"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in release, prose texture distinct and biased toward imprecision's grace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and coherent metaphors like "wasp's nest of copper and glass"; no loops, precise syntax accelerates to closure's "stuttering, spiraling line." Read-aloud cadence peaks flawlessly in bird's flight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk palace and fossil-egg genesis transforms optimization tropes via helical flaw-logic; risk in lyrical CR ("gear skipped... music") heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from early hypotheses.</comment>
