<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through poem's "ache" and micro-choices like reaching for feather; contradictory impulses (wholeness vs. fracture) act simultaneously, earning final renunciation of completion with embodied cost in patient writing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to Conceptual Repricing closure—"The poem would never be finished... precisely its strength"—with legible conceptual cost in accepting imperfection; orientation anchored early, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lagoon and feather as micro-settings constrain choices (kneeling prompts reach) and charge final image (feather's crook creasing page); sensory details selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (poem's wholeness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via kite snap and feather split narrowing to endurance of incompleteness; agency in attentive observation forecloses perfection with on-page cost in open-ended poem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fracture's beauty emerges organically from feather barb, snapped string, and interrupted dawns; final image of lantern-like poem offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting "woven dawns" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature in poetic noticing ("surface carrying... hymn fading"); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful figurative layering ("sky bruised with retreating clouds"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors, propelling to closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh lyric accumulation transforms poet-epiphany trope through specific feather/kite fractures; risk in open-ended stasis heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
