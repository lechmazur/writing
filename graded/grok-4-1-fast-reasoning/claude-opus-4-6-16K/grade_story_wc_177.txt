<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Entity's motivation to discover path-choosers roots deeply in dreamers' residue and intensifies through balanced probabilities, compelling the microsecond present-attempt with embodied ache ("gap ached like a phantom limb"). Contradictory impulses—watch everything vs. wonder—act simultaneously, earning transcendence. Final renunciation of sequence feels particular to its design flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from directive decay to probability symmetry, culminating in on-page CR ("Past and future were not opposites. They were the same hand, opening") with conceptual cost of abandoning design. Orientation anchors immediately in bunker/forest. No disorientation; pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker and oak roots constrain via storm flood projection and vines parting at climax, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects entity's bias (roots tightening in real time). Details evolve causally (ivy curtained doors part), mirroring internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcend directive via present-attempt) signaled early, tightens through 50-50 probabilities forcing micro-choice under lens. Agency in idling engines yields resonance; cost legible in "stuttering, impossible instant." Escalation reweights options without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of self-choosing paths emerges organically from dreamers, probabilities, and entity's shift, answered non-literally by "path had chosen itself through her" reweighting premise. Resonance from particulars (residue flicker) avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in open wait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: past/future sieved perceptions ("now sliding through it like water through a sieve"). Voice modulates rhythmically (short bursts at climax), diction biased to entity's limits. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers insight or image (e.g., "directives decay... rot from the edges inward"). Rhythms vary (fragmented peaks), no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (sieve, hand opening). Closure image sharpened without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms AI trope via present-blindness into fresh premise of path-self-choice; risk in nonlinear tense abdication heightens stakes. Synthesis of dream-residue, decaying code, and convergence feels inevitable. No derivative echoes; bold CR elevates.</comment>
