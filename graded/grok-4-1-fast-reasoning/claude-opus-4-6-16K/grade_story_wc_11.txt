<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unit 7's composure enables deliberate micro-choices like pausing to observe and finally grasping the violin, revealing contradictory impulses between routine duty and emerging awareness; final embrace of the question as "the ordinary instrument" earns a subtle arc with felt cost in returning to sweep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layered observations build to Charged Poise closure when violin resonance merges looped timelines into present; orientation anchored early in courtyard sweep; cost legible in melting violin's integration into rime.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen rime, defunct fountain, and twilight stars constrain isolation and routine, charging final image where melting water joins flagstone rime; selective sensory details (scraping bristles, cosmic dust) filter through Unit 7's janitorial bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Awareness persistence stakes tighten accumulatively via repeated pauses to violin's decisive grasp, forcing trade-off of composure for resonance revelation; agency in holding/tucking violin forecloses logging anomaly, with cost in hummed mystery amid routine.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of thoughts as inexplicable ordinary motion emerges via violin loops reweighting procedure's failure; final image of sweeping with inner hum offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of mechanical poise (e.g., "stone in a shoe it did not wear"); rhythmic diction modulates from patient arcs to resonant hum, heightening pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from sweeps to climax; no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "breathing field of light" integrate without muddle in peak violin hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentient janitor confronting ice violin loops transforms AI-awareness trope into mundane mysticism; risky accumulative structure heightens stakes via irreplaceable resonance payoff.</comment>
