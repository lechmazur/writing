<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through "ambered hush" voice and shaking hands at climax; obsession earns endurance with cost of isolation and finality. Contradictory impulses in persistent charting amid vanishing sky act in scene, compelling final notation. No unearned epiphanies; change credible via decades of records.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to storm-shredded sky revealing one star, enabling CR closure in "She wrote what the darkness around it felt like." Cost legible in shaking hands and "entry she had always been working toward." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridge fort's towers constrain charting choices; stones in pockets and gold leaf flaking charge body-as-micro-setting in final climb. Sensory hierarchy filters through oracle's absence-focus, mirroring internal vanishing. Final up-gaze at marbled hush sky evolves causally post-storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping endless night) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via thinning sky tightens to one-star revelation, narrowing to final summary with agency in notation choice. Cost unmistakable: foreclosed paths in completed map of absences, felt in hands' shake and gentle terror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence's weight emerges from particulars like booklet's pauses and final notation; resonant CR in "universe learning... how to go quiet" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in voice fragments carried to valley invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature attuned to silences/absences; rhythmic hush modulates to peak intensity in final tower climb. Diction controlled, prose-as-character reflects obsessed cartographer's hush. No head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives like "marbled hush" purposeful, not muddled in peak; varied rhythm peaks clean in closure notation. Zero artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography of stellar absences via silence summaries transforms cosmic dimming into intimate endurance. Risky lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes; final star-watch inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
