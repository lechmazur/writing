<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through concrete noticing, like pressing palm to siding for pulse; motivation intensifies from cataloging to decisive placement, earning realization with subtle isolation cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but embodied in hesitation at hollow house. No unearned epiphanies; voice-particular perception drives micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observations to shard placement and faint ignition CR, with cost in Maren's unnoticed gift felt in "Nobody would notice." Orientation anchored early in walks; one tightening via displacement realization narrows to action. Closure image of house breathing reconfigures premise legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Briar Bay's liminal streetlights and spring details constrain evening walks and noticing; recurring amber glow charges final commitment to light. Sensory bias (violets, pulse) mirrors Maren's priorities, integrates into action without stalls. Micro-setting (bungalow porch) enables placement pivotal to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand/revive houses) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to placement agency; density reweights via realization, foreclosing passivity with wait's felt hush. Cost legible in shivering cessation but subtle, charges poise without overt trade-off. Coheres under lens, one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unconscious sanctification emerges from displaced objects' accumulation, reweighted in "every displaced object was a prayer"; final marble image answers non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; CR ties arc to complexity of unnoticed care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (creeping increments, daydreaming lights) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from observation to hushed intensity. Compression taught early pays off in charged closure image; no head-hopping, diction biased to noticer's hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, rhythmic variety (e.g., short ignition sentence amid longer builds); no loops, coherent metaphors like "match struck in a cathedral" propel without muddle. Propulsion peaks at placement; precise, evocative verbs anchor specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of animism via displaced objects' migrations transforms trope of haunted houses into sanctification; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens unnoticed stakes. Marble's journey inevitable hindsight inflection; no hedging, commits to perceptual singularity.</comment>
