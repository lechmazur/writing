<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied ("loves a wound that has finally scarred over"); motivation to preserve echoes intensifies via meteorite trail to compel truth-telling; final choice to write real name and travel earned by contradictory impulses acting in reflections.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from paper chains to meteorite discovery to Norwegian link, tightening to Charged Poise closure ("wrote her real name... booked a train ticket"); cost legible in vulnerability of truth ("fragments, like a meteorite shedding"); orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Attic sensory-rich and POV-biased ("smelled of foxed pages and slow decay"); skylight/dust motes constrain perception and charge final image (pigeon shadow "blooming across her worktable"); micro-setting mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echoes vs. face past) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via trail to personal revelation; agency in tracing/emailing forces trade-off (isolation vs. trust); cost felt in "reach for the wire again" with pigeon reprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation/renewal emerges from particulars (paper songs, dust pigeons, meteorite survival); final image non-literally answers reinvention question ("shadow blooming... lifted and was gone") reweighting loss as potential; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (bird migrations to paper trails); rhythmic diction modulates reflectively ("echoes do not preserve themselves"); purposeful compression of backstory shards legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("receipt from 1923 led to a diary entry"); varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors coherent (wire balance, motes as flock) without muddle in peak (meteorite held to skylight).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pigeon trainer reinvents as paper tracer, meteorite chip bridges to bloodline recordings; risk in lyric reflection heightens renewal stakes; no template echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
