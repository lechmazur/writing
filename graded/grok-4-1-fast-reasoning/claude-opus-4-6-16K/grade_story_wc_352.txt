<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism-mind interiority is concrete and particular, driving micro-choices like methodical photographing amid shaking hands; hesitation before reentering reveals contradictory impulses with earned inheritance cost. Final purpose crystallization forecloses casual scholarship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via doodle→decoding→entry→inversion→discovery→reentry; closure as Charged Poise in "bruised and luminous with purpose," cost legible in accepted burden and timed exit. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; watch checks ensure tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto and mist constrain navigation and reveal door via inversion; "clandestinely luminous" mist charges final parting image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory details (damp rock, sourceless glow) filter through archivist's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (master index access) tightens via timed inversion and "forty-one minutes remained," forcing agency in reentry; cost in "momentary dissolution" and foreclosed reaccess charges closure under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vigilance theme emerges organically from doodle seed to inherited burden, reweighted in "vigilance, once seeded, does not easily die"; final image answers without moralizing, embracing responsibility's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited perceptual signature via refractions and spectral motifs; rhythmic control modulates from deliberate ("one hand trailing") to urgent ("rolling, clutching"); no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (prism, ember) without muddle, propelling via varied syntax; peak inversion beat accelerates cleanly: "boots left the ground... landed on the stalactites."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh gravitational inversion unlocks index of forbidden combinations, transforming archive trope via archivist's vigilance; risk in solo timed delve heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from doodle premise.</comment>
