<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "anxious elation" and scars pulsing during the scar revelation act simultaneously; final step forward earned by prior realizations with unbound cost legible. Interiority particular via dream catalogs and hedge leaning. No safety-hedging in root-bound flaws complicating freedom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hedge reshaping, scar patterns, clipping sink builds to CR closure—"the intersection was not a place... a moment"—reconfiguring separation with trembling cost on final image. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene fits defaults, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and dusk constrain choice via humming frequency parting hedges; scars as body-setting charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: soil footsteps, warm clipping. Details tactile, integrated into realizations without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intersection nexus) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via scar-map deepening knowledge/options; agency in pressing clipping forecloses root-bound path with radiant trembling cost. One decisive intensification sufficient. No abstract stakes—all viscerally felt in glade shudder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of convergence emerges from maze/dreams/scars particulars; final realization non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from scarred hands mirroring corridors, charged in CR. Ambiguity lingers in "roots held" stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in nerve-spiral noticing and groundwater dreams; rhythmic modulation peaks in "sky folded shut like a book." Stable single-POV distance, no leakage. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., clipping "shaped like a key she had never cut"); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening metaphors purposeful for textural lens, not muddling closure. Propulsion accelerates to step forward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of body-as-map, dream-convergence nexus via scars transforms trope; scar pattern reveal inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in topiary agency heightens stakes organically (+0.3). No hedging—commits to surreal logic fully.</comment>
