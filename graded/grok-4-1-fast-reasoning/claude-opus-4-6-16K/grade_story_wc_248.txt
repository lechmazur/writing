<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation: analytically intuitive trait enables recognition of Isen's cuts; past arson reframed as fidelity earns closure commitment with embodied cost in "trembling fingers" and "volcanic tenderness."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: paintings build density to CR closure via letter's revelation; cost legible in "preservation really costs" and final promise-keeping image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains discovery (flashlight in corridors, throat chamber crack); charges closure as "archive breathing around her," mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) tightens accumulatively through six paintings to vandalized portrait; agency in extracting letter forecloses replica path with felt fidelity cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of crumbling-as-truth emerges organically from arson backstory, paintings, letter; final image "The crumbling was the point" reweights preservation non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (feels "absence of truth like a missing tooth"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in chamber discovery without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel to closure; purposeful metaphors ("archive breathing," "volcanic tenderness") integrate without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist seeking mentor's promise via painting trail transforms preservation trope; risk in flawed protagonist heightens stakes organically.</comment>
