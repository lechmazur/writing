<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in mother's erasure compel the closure choice to document rather than warn, with contradictory impulses (wisdom as foolishness) embodied in stitching and signaling; micro-choices like threading in darkness reveal values under coup pressure. Final endurance forecloses warning path with felt cost of invisibility. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of whispers, threads, and network builds to Charged Poise closure in the signal ("Three pulses, pause, two pulses...") with conceptual cost of impending erasure legible in the final image. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via synchronization suffices. Lens taught implicitly, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory acoustics and dome slit constrain listening/signaling choices, charging final wind-dancing flame image; autumn sensory details (oxidized blue, ash whispers) filter through Maren's perceptual bias, evolving causally without stasis. Micro-setting (candle, lenses) mirrors internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unheard stories pre-coup) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through network reveal to agency-driven signal tightening options for listeners; cost felt in "four days out" and endurance of fool's role. Minor abstractness in treason map pre-signal slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of invisible documentation against erasure emerges organically from stitching conspiracies and mother's fate, resonant in final "hears everything" reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in threads as human connections reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (echoes between silences, threads as plots); rhythmic prose modulates from calm charting to charged signal, diction biased toward auditory/textural specificity. No head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent (ash conversations, bruise dome) without muddle in peak signal beat. Minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrite but supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy cartography transforms trope of overlooked seer; risk in acoustic architecture and thread-cipher heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via fool's wisdom premise.</comment>
