<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority and motivation rooted in salvaging remnants, embodied in trembling hands amid cold; micro-choices like arranging evidence reveal values. Minimal on-page contradiction limits to hairline below 9; endurance feels earned without raw struggle dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of dream evidence tightening to Charged Poise closure; candles' flicker as exhaled relief reconfigures the window with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in shrine; single scene coherent, no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glacier shrine's ice walls and borrowed starlight constrain perception and charge final image, mirroring windows motif through warped glass reflections. Sensory selectivity (prickling skin, candle scatter) biases via diver's tactile lens; evolves with evidence spread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose Ailani's truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through dream pattern to sealing case; agency in weaving narrows options with isolation cost felt in solitary rite. One decisive deepening sufficient; closure charges stakes without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silenced voices restored emerges organically from dream windows and snow globe superposition; final open window reweights connections non-literally. Complexity in corporate burial vs. pure salvage avoids binaries; resonance from particulars like palm-pressed glass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (wreck remnants as heavy lives); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate threading to flickering relief. Diction (glacier cathedral, jellyfish dome) biases toward diver's mythic realism; no elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "warped glass caught reflections... superimposed"); varied rhythm breathes with ritual pace, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (ice constellations, frozen cathedral); propulsion peaks clean at candle exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving and dream-triangulation transforms ghost trope; windows cameo mechanic offers non-obvious ingenuity. Risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off at closure; particularized (Karelian Star discrepancies) feels inevitable.</comment>
