<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion in alcove scene, where back-to-wall pressure reveals contradictory longing; final sleep earned by centuries of poem-lining compulsion without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density buildup from shell description to postcard trigger, culminating in CR closure ("She closed her eyes") with legible emotional cost of insomnia's end; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Shell's spiral constrains choices (tightest alcove holds her during longing) and charges final hum/sleep image; sensory details (bioluminescent constellations, coral drafts) filter through poet's bias, mirroring internal spiral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of insomnia-from-pain signaled early, deepened by postcard's armistice news narrowing options to release; under textural lens, cadence shift in humming forces stance crystallization with cost of unwitnessed hours foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-luminous-joy emerges from particulars (poems on walls, galaxy echo); final "bloom" and sleep reweight premise without moral, embracing reef-shadow complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spiral/logarithmic motifs and biased noticing (shell as throat/swallowed sky); rhythmic modulation peaks in imperfect hum, stable close third-person limited.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops, coherent metaphors (pearl around irritant) propel to closure; rhythm varies read-aloud, varying lengths breathe with emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic poet in living shell with blossom armistice transforms war-trope into quiet reconfiguration; risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via centuries-scale intimacy.</comment>
