<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Luminous skeptic trait drives contradictory pursuit despite doubt, shown in mapping and opening the box; final reverence reconfiguration earned via memories surfacing. Interiority concrete through embodied doubt humming "bright and relentless." Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy with ongoing patience cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumbs accumulate to terminus fountain, unstick action triggers water/memories CR with conceptual cost of endless mapping. Orientation anchored early via geese/city. Closure Charged Poise in "turned to map the next tile" reconfigures doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Breadcrumbs tiles and cracked fountain basin constrain path/choice, charging final image; sensory details (rust/moss, held breath) selective via skeptic's notice. Fountains evolve from dry/ivy-choked to mirroring memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access fountain truths via breadcrumbs/geese window) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at unstick to narrow doubt vs. revelation; agency in patient mapping forecloses disbelief path with felt ongoing cost. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of doubt-as-reverence emerges implicitly from skeptic trait, breadcrumbs pursuit, memory surfacing; final "willingness to look without flinching" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: sidereal mapping bias, luminous noticing (geese pause first). Lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to release, diction controlled/textured.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short release sentences post-unstick); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative (doubt "hummed... bright") integrated without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: star-map breadcrumbs to memory-trapping fountains unlocked by geese migration transforms myth tropes via skeptic's realistic mechanism insight; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes.</comment>
