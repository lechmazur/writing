<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly when chip wilts twice near corner-cutting temptation, compelling full-attention micro-choices that earn the final endurance with craftsman's shame as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as panel-by-panel density builds to Resonant Reconfiguration closure; chamber's chord eruption reconfigures imperfection into harmony with patience cost legible in "he understood with a craftsman's shame."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonance chamber's copper walls and rust spirals constrain tuning choices throughout; final luminous breathing charges closure image, with sensory hierarchy (molars-felt C note) reflecting repairman's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim light tightens accumulatively via chip-wilting reversals narrowing to precise agency; cost unmistakably embodied in twice-averted dishonesty, charging final harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection-as-instrument emerges organically through rust-to-patina transformation; final image resonant non-literal answer—"builders had never achieved because they had never known"—reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward mechanisms ("spirals that mimicked music box cylinders"); rhythmic control modulates from humming tension to chordal release without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated specifics ("rose and mercury" shift, molars hum) with zero loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally, peaking in flawless closure chord sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh rust-covenant premise synthesizes acoustics and craft into inevitable tinkersong payoff; risk of lyric accumulative repair transforms restoration trope through iridescent patina ingenuity.</comment>
