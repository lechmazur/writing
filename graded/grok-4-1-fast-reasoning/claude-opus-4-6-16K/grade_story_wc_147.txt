<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak at "Every instinct told her to take the vial and kick hard... But... she would have to override," earning the endurance choice with oxygen cost scaling to air gauge readings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density tightens to vial activation, delivering CR closure in "light clung to her... proof that the fleeting matters," with oxygen constraint shaping the ascent image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Temple's silt-thick water and bioluminescent coral constrain ascent instinct versus lingering touch, charging the receding "lonesome splendor" in the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant survival stake signaled early deepens accumulatively via triggered memories overriding flight, with air dropping to eight minutes forcing agency in vial grasp and audible rescue payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vial as ephemeral distiller reweights carvings' memory pull against loss (partner, air), resonating in ascent carrying "three thousand years of borrowed memory" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Diver-specific perceptual signature shines in "columns rose... like ribs of some enormous sleeping creature," with rhythmic hush modulation sustaining close-third stability under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms from "headlamp cutting... silt" to "light spooled from its facets"; zero loops, coherent metaphors like "amber holds a moth" clear peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Memory-harnessing temple transforms Atlantis trope via sensory carvings and vial engine, with oxygen risk synthesizing archaeology into inevitable CR proof of endurance.</comment>
