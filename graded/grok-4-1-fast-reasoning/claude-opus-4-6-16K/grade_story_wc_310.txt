<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (obscene enthusiasm vs. private thrill in decoding) embodied in "quietly enthusiastic" restraint; final endurance to "tell the crew" earned by coin-causality and stellar doubt pressing ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via faster bursts and coin scatter revealing "observatory...losing coherence"; Charged Poise closure in "She stood... Especially then" lands with coin-weight cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber light from "stellar death" and impossible coins constrain burst-mapping choice; recurring coins charge final "pooled around her feet" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (align with purpose) signaled early, deepens accumulatively in coin pattern forcing "un-happening" realization; endurance agency forecloses inaction with doubt-cost in final stand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chance-governance in reverse causality emerges implicitly; final "even if the coins fell the same way twice. Especially then" reweights premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias ("symphony played in reverse"); rhythmic control in lyric diction ("un-happened," "wavelength align") heightens cosmic intimacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in coin-scatter beat ("copper disk...titanium sliver"); varied rhythm propels to resolute close without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Reverse-causality prophecy + electromagnetic coins synthesize fresh end-times frame; risk in "backwards prophecy" heightens stakes, inevitable in closing choice.</comment>
