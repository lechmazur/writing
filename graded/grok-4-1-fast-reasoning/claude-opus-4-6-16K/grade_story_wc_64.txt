<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's blithe proximity to death roots motivation consistently, with curiosity-as-grief embodied in "soil settles after rain" and micro-choices like pinning tapestry to decode under time pressure. Final endurance—carrying intentions forward—earned by decoding causality, foreclosing ignorance with 40-year conceptual cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via devotion to all graves yet singular pull of Voss's.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds thread-by-thread to pattern break (Clara's name/coords), cadence shift in final CR ("some seeds take forty years to bloom") reconfigures buried-message premise with undeniable patience-cost. Orientation anchored by clock at ~50 words. One tightening sufficient; no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt silo's blue walls and pooled starlight constrain as "outside of time," charging final "blue throat" image; selective sensory (velveteen gloom, ticking silence) mirrors decoding urgency via gardener's tactile priorities. Body/tool (corkboard-pinned tapestry) guides action without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape of intentions) signaled early, deepens via chess-to-threads mapping narrowing ignorance; agency in sustained decoding forces stance crystallization under Accum lens. Cost legible in expired game and 40-year wait reweighting options at "right hands would hold the right threads."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of intentions-as-seeds emerges implicitly from decoding particulars, not statement; final image non-literally answers "what Edmund meant" via blooming metaphor, reweighting premise with grief/curiosity ambiguity and social cost of separated graves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (gardener noticing knots like plots) biases details character-specifically; rhythmic control modulates from clock's "final tick" to poised exit, with purposeful compression in decoding taught early and legible at CR closure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "blithe about death the way a lighthouse keeper is blithe about storms" anchors voice/motif/action); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, figurative coherence in "velveteen gloom" purposeful without muddle or loops in peak decode beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grave-treasure trope via chess/tapestry encoding for posthumous reunion, fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight from gardener's devotion; risk in Accum lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmick, committing to premise implications.</comment>
