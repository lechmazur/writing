<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between researcher's skepticism and emerging wonder acts in chamber climax; placing arrowhead earns transformative choice with embodied cost of weeping/laughing. Backstory anchors tilt present descent without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via phone confessions to chamber RR (Charged Poise) where harmony reconfigures bitterness with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored by para 1, pattern holds cleanly to "her own voice was already beginning to record."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Underground garden and chamber details (roots curling, stones orbiting) constrain descent choice and charge final weightless image; sensory selectivity (bioluminescence flaring gold) reflects researcher POV bias toward anomalies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Petra's truth) deepens accumulatively through recordings to chamber agency (arrowhead offering), foreclosing skeptic path with internal shift cost; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness transmuted to cosmic wonder emerges organically from particulars (papers to harmony); final "weightless and weeping and laughing" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing Clovis arrowhead, gravitational flickers); rhythmic control modulates from tense crouching to playful chamber exhale without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; minor figurative density ("cathedral of green," "braids water upward") in opening risks overwrite but integrates without muddle or loops touching climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid lore, fungal symbiosis, and gravitational anomaly transforms tropes via researcher arc; arrowhead offering and phone reprise feel inevitable, risking bold cosmic punchline payoff.</comment>
