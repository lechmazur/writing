<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (nervous tremor vs. steady voice) act simultaneously in the presentation scene, compelling the higher-stakes choice to reveal the nail; final endurance of dread wrings dry as earned renunciation with palpable emotional cost. Interiority particular via cartography-as-justice lens; Halvorsen applies targeted pressure via examination. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrival with journals → presentation → director's tracing of coordinates to Helviksand → reversal promise, delivering Charged Poise closure where dread forecloses doubt with emotional exhale ("dread... began, at last, to wring itself dry"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (ferry to station); one tightening suffices. Cost legible in nail's warmth and pictured registry restoration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Copper nail as recurring micro-setting constrains final image, charging closure with tactile patina and warmth mirroring Britta's patient exhale. Atmosphere vivid/selective (ozone-mildew air, breathing winds) reflects POV urgency, narrowing to nail/station walls at peak. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward coastal erasure; weather pressures exterior subtly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exile reversal) signaled early, tightens causally via Halvorsen's coordinate trace matching Helviksand loss, forcing stance crystallization in his promise. Agency in Maren's presentation/question narrows options; felt emotional cost (dread's wringing) charges end without live antagonist. One deepening suffices; moral calculus (truth vs. Guild erasure) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cartographic justice emerges implicitly from particulars (coded stanzas vs. burned maps), reweighted in final registry image without moralizing. Subtext in nail's handling implies overlooked bravery's cost; irony of sea returning evidence charges resonance. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question of honest borders undoing erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (maps as rebellion/justice); diction/rhythm modulate from nervous buildup to poised exhale. Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (Maren's protocol cite, Halvorsen's murmur), distinguishing voices via professional idiom. No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge (e.g., journals' codes revealed on-page).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., "The air inside tasted of ozone and mildew" advances atmosphere/foreshadowing). Rhythms vary (short punchy lines at presentation, flowing at close); zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion peaks clean in "I'll file for reversal tonight," anchoring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: jet stream shift unearths coded journals proving cartographic heroism, transforming exile trope via sea's return and nail's exhale. Risk in quiet closure (no drama, just reconfiguration) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from rockfall coordinates to Helviksand payoff.</comment>
