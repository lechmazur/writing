<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (trembling hands, visions as "churning sea"); curse creates contradictory impulses acting in scene; final harnessing earned via rock placements mirroring eel patterns, with weep as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rock arrangements to contextual vision to final web; CR/RR closure on-page ("visions...settled...rhythmic, navigable") with conceptual cost of lifelong curse reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frictionless sinusoidal waves and eels constrain placements on bluff edge; aurora's "borrowed dawn" charges final glow image; sensory hierarchy via Maren's pattern bias integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness visions via patterns) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with contextual vision ("minutes from now"); agency in final stone forecloses chaotic futures with legible weep/cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: pattern as "relationship" not decode, friction masking geometry; final spiral/standing still reweights premise without moral, resonant via eel-rock mirroring.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (sacred geometries, eel currents); rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise ("beautiful, terrible coherence"); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "spectral filaments that connected stone to stone"); varied rhythm accelerates to climax blaze/soften; zero loops, coherent metaphors enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless physics, eel geometries, star-dust rocks transforms precog curse trope; risky accumulative lyricism heightens pattern stakes organically to inevitable coherence.</comment>
