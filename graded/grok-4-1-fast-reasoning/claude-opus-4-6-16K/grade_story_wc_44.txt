<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quietly deliberate trait roots scholarly motivation and compels high-stakes choice to awaken the automaton, with contradictory caution vs. curiosity embodied in tweezers extraction and loop-tracing ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from spoons bending to rune scramble, key jam, and shadow plot converging in Charged Poise closure; shadow's return pointing to noon reconfigures reality with conceptual cost of unleashed entity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating isle's observatory dome, orrery gears, and Ashenmere view constrain extraction, rune work, and final glimpse of geometric shape below, charging the shadow's return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of tracing shadows escalates via rune rearrangement and key realization under Accumulative lens, agency in loop-closing forecloses sealing option with cost of feeding the entity deliberately.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of noticing as dangerous scholarship emerges organically; final shadow stretching "long and certain" non-literally answers noon disappearance, reweighting observation's power with awakening's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature filters world through rune-biased noticing (e.g., "loops like a thread passing through itself"); rhythmic control heightens deliberate tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and specifics like "fiddlehead ferns" and "hum rose to a pitch that rattled the copper dome"; zero loops, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune loops as sealed awakenings feeding on shadows transforms cosmic horror tropes; risk of deliberate unleashing heightens stakes organically.</comment>
