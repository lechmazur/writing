<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority and motivation rooted in archival drive, shown through laying out photos; micro-choices like arranging by arc angle reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper conflict. Earned realization of collective effort forecloses solo mastery with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo arrangement forms continuous arc by mid-story, deepening to CR closure in final paragraphs where fragments prove "whole all along." Orientation anchored early (Maren at lavender edge). Cost legible in patient assembly line: "waiting only for the patient archivist."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like vines "braided through shattered windows" and lavender rows constrain choice (photos laid "between the rows") and charge final image of ongoing growth. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist's calm notice; setting mirrors healing theme without overt symbolism. Environment guides lingering reverence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete arc/masterpiece) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when arranged photos connect, narrowing to collective realization. Agency in lingering and photographing forecloses individual ownership. Felt cost in backstory's poisoned soil patience; minor abstractness in stakes keeps from 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges from photo fragments and field, reweighting solo effort in CR ending without moralizing. Final image ("vines kept climbing... arcs curving toward whoever would find them next") offers resonant answer to fragmentation question. Organic from particulars, invites ambiguity on healing's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: archival metaphors like "grief went to be alphabetized." Lyrical rhythm modulates serene discovery to charged poise; purposeful compression in revelations feels taught and legible. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to puzzle patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent ("broken teeth," "amber tears") without muddle, propelling via varied syntax. Rhythm varies read-aloud, accelerating in arrangement beat. Strategic telling in backstory anchors present filing; no overwriting in peak image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puzzle-solving archivist uncovering real phytoremediation via planted photos transforms tropes of hidden history. Ingenuity in arcs as "lens flares but felt like something more," inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk in Accumulative frame heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
