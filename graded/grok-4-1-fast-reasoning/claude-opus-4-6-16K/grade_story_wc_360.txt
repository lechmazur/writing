<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between borrowed personalities and direct transposed empathy act simultaneously during composition; final realization earned by prior causality with visible cost in transposed ache against sternum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as star vanishings build density to CR closure in "this is the equation... unbearable clarity of feeling what the universe feels"; cost legible in fragment going cold and spaces between stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Topaz floor as prismatic lens constrains data collection and charges final image of counting spaces; sensory details (warm fragment hum, starlight equations) filter through POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of emotion) signaled early tightens texturally when stars vanish mid-composition and fragment cools, forcing stance crystallization with agency in setting fragment amid type.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of loss as compounding waveform emerges organically; final image of nesting fragment among letters offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("through the borrowed lens of someone else's attention"); rhythmic control modulates from lucid setup to turbulent peak without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("She locked the type into the chase, inked the press, and pulled the lever"); zero loops or scaffolds, figurative coherence in "light through cut stone" serves voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress ambiguity and stellar grief waveform transforms loss tropes; risk-taking in lyric math-of-emotion premise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
