<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory calm under Soren's anxiety forces micro-choices like deliberate resin strokes; final "bring it back" earns stasis with ongoing devotion cost, shown in reverent reassembly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via vibration asymmetry to perfect hum tightening; charged poise closure in "hum dissolved into distance" reconfigures options with ship's felt urgency cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Water trough constrains blind testing via heat refraction, charging closure parallel in mist's living mirror; tactile depot anchors POV without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone fix before ship) deepens accumulatively via horn/winches; Elara's endurance agency narrows failure option with legible time cost in rushed handoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of hands on "next broken thing" resonates as non-literal answer to mending imperfection, reweighting craft's directional role without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blind perceptual signature privileges sound/touch (fracture by sound, thermal shifts); Soren's anxious directness contrasts Elara's proverbial idiom seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("link by heavy link"); opening mist metaphor coheres without muddle, sharpening closure hum image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind heat-refraction repair transforms artisan trope into fresh sci-fi synthesis; risk of calm under maiden-voyage clock heightens stakes organically.</comment>
