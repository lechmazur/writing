<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through knot-reading and moon-path alignment; micro-choices like water test reveal values hierarchy with embodied attention as love. Final endurance earned via pattern accumulation, no unmotivated epiphanies. Competence balanced by sacred secrecy of technique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mending to whistling realization; CR closure in net lattice and firefly escort reweights hidden effort with conceptual cost of "shining, regardless." Orientation anchored by para. 1; one tightening via rhythm convergence suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Parapet, net, whisk as micro-settings constrain mending tests and charge final lattice image; sensory hierarchy (whisper, moonlight, glow) POV-biased to net-mender. Rainwater evolution causal; fireflies mirror internal patterns without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort) signaled early, escalates texturally via pattern density to whistling micro-turn narrowing to universal insight; agency in sustained attention forecloses oversight with felt modesty cost in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silent architectures emerges from particulars (knots, whisper, blinks); final image non-literally answers via prayer-like folding, recharging motifs without moralizing. Resonance from irony of unapplauded labor, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Close-3rd perceptual signature (philosophy in filaments, moon honesty) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, purposeful compression taught early. No head-hopping; diction reflects contemplative mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moon was honest... sun too generous"); varied rhythm passes ear test, metaphors coherent/pattern-taught without muddle. Zero loops; propulsion mirrors reflective escalation, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of craftsman-as-seer via moon-path mending and whisk test; transforms quiet observation trope into prayer-stasis with risk-taking lyric texture heightening stakes of attention. No template echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
