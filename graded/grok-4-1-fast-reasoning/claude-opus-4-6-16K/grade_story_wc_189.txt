<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—rehearsed anger as "stone in her chest" versus tidal "tangential approach"—act simultaneously, earning closure renunciation via wrist-pulse micro-choice that reveals values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density builds to Charged Poise RR in "something older and stranger, something with wings," with cost legible in cicada's "patient resurrection" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal pools and grotto constrain choices via incoming tide, charging closure where "pools began to merge" mirrors relational reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of anger-vs-connection deepens accumulatively through pause-as-transition, forcing agency in tangential speech; cost unmistakable in foreclosing "stagnant" isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cicada motif reweights "transition periods" from burial to renewal in pocket-tuck image, offering resonant answer to time's texture without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct tidal-perceptual signature—"texture of time"—filters crisis, with dialogue subtext distinguishing voices; rhythm modulates to charged final exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via lines like "The tide was coming in—she could hear it building," with zero loops or muddled metaphors at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Texture of time" tidal frame transforms reconciliation trope, with cicada-veins/grotto synthesis risking heavy metaphor but heightening stakes organically.</question>
