<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (throat tightens at sly encodings); contradictory guilt vs. duty acts simultaneously in micro-choices like overlaying chain on diagrams; final adjustment choice earned via Elias's precedent with visible cost of doubt-filtered resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries (envelope → etchings → adhesive) tighten knowledge toward Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "shaking hands steadied" before reaching tools; orientation anchored early in amphitheater.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breathing walls and dripping condensation constrain workshop actions and mirror internal shifts (groans like sleeping animal); final caldera breath charges image, filtering through machinist priorities like cam profiles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (throughput vs. irrigation) signaled early, deepens via 2% shave calculation narrowing to sly agency; cost unmistakable in foreclosed compliance path, charged in final tool reach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of engineered mercy emerges implicitly via chain encodings and adhesive proof; final "precision and mercy... partners" image offers resonant CR reweighting prior guilt without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with machinist perceptual signature (notices tenth-link etchings under lamp); rhythmic control modulates from discovery tension to poised cadence in closing breath sync.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (dust sifts as walls breathe); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent and purposeful (cracks like old face); peak resolve beat propels cleanly without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machinist encoding mercy in chain transforms engineering trope; sly chain reprise and adhesive analysis feel inevitable, risking quiet dappled closure over confrontation.</comment>
