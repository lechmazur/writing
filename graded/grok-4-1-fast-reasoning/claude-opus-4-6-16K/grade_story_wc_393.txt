<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority shines in embodied contradiction—"sorry came easily, a reﬂex"—vs. Delia's "Be something," compelling his insistent "I'd like a second opinion" that earns the closure renunciation of apology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via descriptive buildup to light-shaft DC/RR at "light crossed the counter... illuminating the tiny brass gears," reconfiguring repair options with felt cost of past failures; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurrent ticking "small hearts, beating" and light shafts constrain Sol's choice and charge final image, with "vibrant hush" filtering Maren's chapel-biased perception purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill Delia's promise) tightens accumulatively via Sol's "doesn't deserve" opposition, forcing Maren's agency in quiet reversal; light-deepening forecloses cheap reproduction with legible emotional cost in exhale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of action over apology emerges organically from "Deserve" snag and repaired "clockwork heart," resonant non-literal answer in final "resurrected melody... mechanical legs into the broken, luminous world."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in deliberate phrasing like "aptly deliberate in every motion"; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, Sol's blunt "doesn't deserve" vs. Maren's quiet persistence distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion in "light broke through... the way light breaks through storm clouds," varying syntax without loops or overwriting; zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaplain's mercy lens on broken mechanism, transformed by light-shaft ingenuity and "second opinion" pivot on "deserve," risking quiet lyric closure that heightens thematic stakes.</comment>
