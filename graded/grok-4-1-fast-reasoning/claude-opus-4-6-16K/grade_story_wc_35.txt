<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in tasting regrets as constellations; motivation compels the submersion choice at "She let it come," earning change via prior affliction of contagion, with contradictory embrace of flood resolving singular grief into shared shell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of borrowed griefs layers to RR closure at "The ice refroze... trapping her remorse," with legible cost in diluted but persistent bitterness; orientation anchored early in courtyard; no shards exceed defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion's frozen coral constrains ritual via pools and cold surge; rain-compacted sand enables access, charging final "desert washed clean"; sensory bias via taste elevates over visual catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to smooth daughter's face tightens via "let it come," agency in pressing/withdrawing hands narrows options under textural lens; cost unmistakable in "sturdy shell... would not shatter."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared grief emerges implicitly via mingled flavors, resonant non-literal answer in final kitchen return reweighting solitude; no moralizing, ambiguity in "not erased. Sanded down."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with tasting as perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates from lyrical setup to terse peak at "The cold climbed... tasted her daughter's last breath"; purposeful fantasy lexicon fits chef's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; density peaks in ritual with layered senses advancing immersion; rhythm varies for propulsion, e.g., short sentences in flood surge heighten pressure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes tasting memories with coral reliquary into non-obvious remorse storage; risk in impossible ice/desert transforms grief arc, inevitable in hindsight via sandpaper metaphor constraining tactics.</comment>
