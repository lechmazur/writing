<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation intensifies credibly from discovery ("felt her blood go cold") to interference, with embodied caution ("cautiously hopeful") balancing competence and isolation cost in final endurance. Internal conflict emerges in whispered "cosmic tricksters" diagnosis versus hopeful interference. Flaw of solitary action compounds into earned social cost without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discoveries because/therefore lead to transmission DC, response silences signals (monitors flicker, hum deepens). Closure as CR in "sky was just the sky again" reweights premise with human hatred cost. Heavy BRR (~25%) anchors present via charts/desk, tilting interference; one tightening sufficient. Orientation anchored early (radio station, Maren).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's "burnt coffee and ionized dust" plus analog board constrain subsonic access and choice to transmit. Teeth ache from hum embodies crisis narrowing. Final sky emptiness charges closure image as micro-setting contrast. POV bias filters astrophysics priorities vividly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose deception) signaled early, tightens via transmission agency narrowing options to outwit. Response reversal forces stance crystallization with on-page cost (formulas degrade, fury on Maren). Pressure causal/escalates coherently without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of deceptive gifts seeding dependency emerges via secondary patterns, reweighted in CR ending ("saved them from a slow poison, and they hated her"). Final image answers "what to do next" non-literally with human vs. cosmic complexity. No moralizing; irony from knowledge gap lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (astrophysics filters: "rhythmic pulses," "harmonic ghost"). Voice texture modulates intensity (short sentences in transmission: "Every monitor flickered"). No dialogue; diction character-bound, rhythmic control under stress intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "spread the astronomical charts... trembling" advances setting/action/atmosphere). No loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short peak: "Silence. Pure, absolute silence"). Propulsion clear, specific verbs/nouns propel to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subsonic deception/mirroring outwits aliens, transforming first-contact trope via delayed-trap logic. Risk in quiet CR ending heightens human flaw stakes. Irreplaceable particulars (harmonic ghosts, empanadas bribe) feel organic.</comment>
