<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (caution vs. longing) act in bridge crossing and wing tilt; final shift to "entrusted light" earned by donor envy and heart knocks, with embodied cost in sternum presses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure; "entrusted light" reconfigures borrowed heart premise with legible emotional cost in letter composition image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rotating basalt's sun trails constrain wing experiment and charge final insight; mist "like slow exhalations" mirrors internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake deepens via light eruption triggering heart knock, narrowing envy to integration; visible price in "foreign, faithful rhythm" alters stance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wing-heart parallel emerges organically, reweighting "pigment vs. structural color"; final "quietly explosive with blue" answers magnetism non-literally with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dye-master signature in "indigo clings to linen" and color cadences biases perception; rhythmic modulation peaks at "blue erupted," stable close third-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "detonation of blue that required no chemical"; "erupted, a silent explosion" propels climax rhythm perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Morpho-heart synthesis transforms transplant trope into structural refraction; risk of lyric CR inevitable from dye-master lens and rotating light.</comment>
