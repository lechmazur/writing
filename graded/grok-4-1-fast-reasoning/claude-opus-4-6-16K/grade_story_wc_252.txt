<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—graceful flow amid braced wariness—act simultaneously in her dock work and wading choice; final detachment earned by scrimshaw's warmth unlocking her guarded self with relational cost as Callum witnesses. Interiority concrete via thumb on whale carving and sternum-resonating call. Callum's patient pressure forces her pivot without dominance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dialogue exposition to whale call buckling sea, yielding Charged Poise closure as Maren swims and island holds, reconfiguring her performed self with felt cost of detachment. Orientation anchored early in docks and post-Silencing. Single scene causality subtle but intact via scrimshaw cue to call.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe micro-setting constrains wading escalation and charges final swim image, with kelp/anemones and rising water tactile via boots-to-knees progression. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: threats scanned amid competence. Whale mouth carving and island birth mirror internal unlock without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (detach from armor for true self) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via whale call narrowing to swim agency; cost legible in foreclosed dock role as water cascades from island flanks. Callum's pursuit complicates without resolving. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (violence ends but pain/armor lingers; true self demands cost) emerges via particulars like whale-resonating sternum and island surfacing, resonant in final splashes reweighting Silencing's promise without moral. Subtext in Callum's ragged breath refusing her vanish. Ambiguity lingers in his choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Maren-specific perceptual bias (hard eyes scanning absent threats); rhythmic prose modulates from wary flow to deeper song cadence. Dialogue subtextual—Callum's "fairy tale" evokes snap/retreat pattern. No head-hopping; diction ocean-attuned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "kelp draped like funeral bunting") without overwriting peaks; rhythm varies for propulsion, climax sharp in "sea buckled upward." No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Final image recharges scrimshaw motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms pirate-island trope via Silencing worldrule and scrimshaw-as-heart-key; whale call from sternum innovates summoning with emotional specificity. Risky lyric accrual to Charged Poise feels inevitable. No derivatives; synthesis organic to guarded grace.</comment>
