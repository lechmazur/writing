<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensor-mediated interiority particularizes emotions vividly; micro-choices like extending hand under fossil reveal values. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during fossil encounter, but endurance as translator earned with solitude cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as thermal signatures build density to fossil's "gratitude" pulse; charged poise closure reconfigures isolation via legible conceptual cost in final smile amid breathing dark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and thermal currents constrain approach and float fossil, charging final image; sensory hierarchy via professional sensors filters purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of charting blooms tightens accumulatively to fossil deepening, narrowing to translator role; fossil's ache/loss cost felt on-page, foreclosing detached mapping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fossil as planetary transitional object emerges organically, final pulse offering resonant non-literal answer to voicing unknown without moralizing; reweights human-earth separation via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in thermal-emotional diction and syntax; stable limited POV with rhythmic modulation heightens cave hum and fossil pulse without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, coherent metaphors like "emotional fingerprints"; propulsion peaks in fossil mapping beat, varying rhythm supports accumulative closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Planetary transitional fossil synthesizes heat-mapping sci-fi with emotional geology originally; risk in "factually mystical" premise inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes sans gimmick.</comment>
