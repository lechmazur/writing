<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logical patterns vs. dreamlike inference of parallels) act simultaneously in arranging and observing; final endurance of grief as "load-bearing" earned by tide collaboration, with embodied cost in chest's precondition for joy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via tide's advance and pattern shifts to Conceptual Repricing closure ("new equation... held in the body's memory") with undeniable conceptual cost of chaos-required hope; orientation anchored early in grotto/gauge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto and materials (beads, wire, sea glass) constrain choices by shifting under water, charging final image of "serene upheaval"; sensory hierarchy (wet stone, swirling ankles) reflects Maren's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (new hope equations) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tide's editing (one decisive deepening foreclosing static hope), forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in submerged pattern's "collaboration between intention and chaos."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of dynamic hope emerges organically from pattern-tide interplay, not statement; final image of clouds as "trial balloons... finding it survivable" offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward mathematical metaphors ("prime numbers," "syntax"); rhythmic control modulates from watchful detail to charged poise at "water swirled around her ankles," no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/stakes (e.g., "tide crept in, licking the edges"); no loops, scaffold, or muddled metaphors—lyric pattern taught early, zero figurative overload in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief ritual as mathematical experimentation (patterns via primes, tide co-authoring) feels inevitable from logical dreamer premise; risk-taking in parallel-timeline inference heightens universality without gimmickry.</comment>
