<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face blindness as contradictory engine compels methodical choices, embodied in gesture/texture perception; final solving choice earned via prior sketches and flaw integration. Minor diagnostic label ("Prosopagnosia") in opener doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sketches/hands builds to CR closure ("I have enough to reopen it") with conceptual cost in her blindness-empathy drive; orientation anchored early in descent; final mist-clearing image reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist/quarry constrains drawing (thins for paper) and charges closure (thickens as internal "clearing"); tactile granite/ribbon integrate via POV bias; sensory hierarchy matches methodical calm-to-revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen cold case) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via recurring hands to suspect ID; agency in pinning ribbon/ call tightens options; felt cost of blindness legible in process, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Empathy-through-blindness emerges via opposites unification in sketches/hands; final revelation ("deepest human truths...") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing; reweights premise in mist-clearing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (texture/gesture over faces); rhythmic control modulates from deliberate descent to charged call; diction purposeful, lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels from descent to revelation; no loops/artifacts; metaphors purposeful ("lanced," mist "alive") without muddle in peak drawing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face-blind artist solving via hands/ribbon transforms cold-case trope organically; fresh synthesis of prosopagnosia as investigative strength inevitable in hindsight; risk in opposites method heightens closure.</comment>
