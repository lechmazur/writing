<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the mirror revelation versus prior belief in shadows' worth, embodied via pulsing arms; release choice earned with specific memory loss as cost, fulfilling 9+ test without epiphanic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from routine to mirror self-vision, delivering Charged Poise closure in shadow release ("The loss was immediate and specific"); cost legible on-page, constraint (shadows/memories) shapes final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard apples, groaning ice, and mirrors constrain scrying and charge orchard exit image; sensory selection (salt/iron taste, percussive ice) reflects POV priorities, fulfilling 9+ test via final walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empathy method's viability) signaled early, tightens via self-vision in mirrors forcing release; agency-driven under lens with visible cost (memory forfeiture altering stance), nearing 9+ but minor abstractness in initial stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Empathy-as-hoarding theme emerges via shadow mechanics and mirror glimpses, resonant non-literal answer in lighter willingness reweighting prior service without moralizing; final image echoes carved principle organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (shadow intuition, mirror intimacy); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive calm to decision poise, fulfilling 9+ test; no dialogue, no issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates setting/action without loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in cellar description ("corridors of diminishing light") risks figurative density but supports texture without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadow absorption as violence souvenirs ingeniously transforms peacekeeper trope, with mirror-crystal scrying synthesizing fresh world logic; risk in intuitive release heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
