<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in ledger-keeping and bark-reading, with micro-choices like using the sextant compelling the witnessing; final realization earned via persistent pursuit without safety-hedging. Contradictory impulses subtle but embodied in accepting "mundane miracles" amid grief's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: dream density builds to pattern reversal at pin-drop ("every tree...exhaled"), delivering CR closure with conceptual cost of absorbed sorrow now witnessed; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinth as "building with bad plumbing" filters through maintenance POV, with bark fissures and luminous pollen constraining mapping choice; moonlight charges final image, evolving causally from storm-wet stones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness tree visions) signaled early, escalates via dream-mapping density to pin-induced release under Accumulative lens; agency in sextant use forecloses ignorance with cost of seeing "ten thousand dreams" legible in lowered sextant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quantified grief releasing via witness emerges organically from ledger and bark-lines to exhale of light; final image ("ledger would need new pages") reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sorrow-lines," "luminous pollen") biases toward maintenance idiom, with rhythmic modulation building to silence; stable close third-person, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("pin...struck...rang like a bell"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, purposeful figuratives like "clean bone" moon enhance without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sorrow-absorbing trees and dream-pollen mapping transforms labyrinth trope; risk in CR via tree-exhale inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
