<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal realization—"the tapestry's final lesson was not the counter-sequence at all"—earned by contradictory pride (teaching gambit) and atonement (years fidgeting), with hands trembling then stilling as embodied cost of patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds decoding density to knight move ("the board rang like a bell"), delivering DC (time resumes) and RR (self-understanding) with seven years' solitude as legible cost in final hand stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tapestry's frayed border threads constrain decoding choice and charge knight-move climax; frozen rain beads and circling thunder selectively mirror internal hush, evolving to honest rain at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (undo freeze/atone) tightens via patient thread-decoding under accumulative lens, protagonist agency in guiding knight foreclosing exile path with years' solitude cost felt in stilling hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final "No... neither did you lose" non-literally reconfigures gambit premise as life's unresolved grace, emerging from fidget-to-stillness arc without moralizing, inviting complex forgiveness reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature—"fingers perpetually working... meditative creases"—holds rhythmic control through decoding hush to closure stillness; minimal dialogue natural and goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Pull, read, release. The rhythm was a woven hush" delivers peak density and propulsion without loops or muddle; varied syntax and coherent metaphors (rain glass beads) sustain ear-test rhythm to thunder-break closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen-time trope transformed by chess gambit's temporal weave decoded via tapestry borders, synthesizing originality in self-forgiveness calculus that risks subtle fantasy logic to heighten emotional stakes.</comment>
