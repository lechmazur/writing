<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Guardian's silence as deep listening and micro-choice of mirror light to boy reveal contradictory impulses (action amid stillness) with earned endurance; boy's softening shoulders show relational crucible without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density to Charged Poise closure in "his shoulders had softened, and his breathing had matched itself to hers"—reconfigures loneliness with felt emotional cost; oriented early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cobalt dock and wet planks constrain light play and reflections, charging final constellation image on canal; sensory hierarchy (iron-wet air, gleaming boards) mirrors internal states through goal-directed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving patterns against darkness/loneliness deepens texturally with boy's arrival and mirror-gesture agency, foreclosing isolation via shared silence; cost legible in endured stillness reconfigured as company.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loneliness as adjustable shutter emerges organically from particulars, resonant in final "stillwater tension" image answering without moral; subtext in unlit lantern and softened shoulders avoids tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of pattern-weaving (shutters as loom/constellation); rhythmic diction modulates stillness to tension, no leakage, voice biased to light-in-darkness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via images like "coin of light sliding across the wet planks"; minor simile density in opening beats but coherent, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dental mirror/shutters as invented constellation transforms guardian trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes of silent connection without gimmickry.</comment>
