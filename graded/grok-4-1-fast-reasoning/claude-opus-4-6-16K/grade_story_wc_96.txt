<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's molting selves show contradictory impulses acting via documented poems and choices like shelter avoidance; final endurance of fracture earned through Jonah's "rebuild" reframing her loss as defiance. Interiority concrete and particular, flaws (entropy risk) complicate without hedging. Minor summary of past selves doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via monthly shards building to Charged Poise CR in final stargazing image, where waiting/composing reconfigures selves with conceptual cost of perpetual fracture. Mosaic pattern taught early ("molted monthly"); orientation anchored in library by para 2. No slips; constraint of tin/poems shapes final taping act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted library beams framing stars constrain choices (home, readings) and charge final image of lying beneath open sky. Coffee tin as micro-setting evolves from dumpster find to onstage archive to letter holder. Sensory selectivity (silver moonlight, wind-peeled ceiling) POV-biased toward poet's resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forging meaning from disorder signaled early, escalates accumulatively via audience growth and tin-opening to letter's reweighting; agency in continuing readings forecloses entropy path with felt cost of "fractured" selves. One decisive deepening at July reading suffices. Price legible in ongoing molting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of disorder as luminous meaning emerges organically from molting shards and poems; final image of composing in "stranger's handwriting" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in tin's "resistance" vs. visible poverty. No direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("stars attended every reading," "crocus splits asphalt") biases toward fractured beauty; rhythmic control modulates from reflective shards to charged closure. Stable close third-person; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "vagrant penny poet whose currency was language"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful and voice-integrated in peak (tin reveal); zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Molting personalities and tin-archive synthesis feels inevitable, transforming vagrant trope via prison-poet bond and starlit readings. Bold mosaic risk heightens stakes without gimmick; fresh angle on reinvention as "luminous edge of each breaking."</comment>
