<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode and broadcast fragments intensifies convincingly from isolation to agency, rooted in stubborn traits and embodied in pacing the portico. Internal conflict emerges in hoarding vs. sharing doors, with the final choice to broadcast earning a visible cost of deepened solitude. Minor slip in epiphanic summary at "Prophecy wasn't a leash" feels slightly unearned amid reflection density.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fragment density builds to CR closure in Elara's seed catalog realization and open dawn, with cost legible in her storm-lit smile and uncertain world below. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2; shards interleave purposefully without causality breaks. Final portico hum reconfigures prophecy premise with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains via signal amplification and charges final hum image, while storm clouds/stars filter Elara's priorities amid thin air urgency. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under isolation: lightning paints face blue, glass hums frequencies. No white-room; lived-in choreography via notebooks stacked to ceiling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape dawn vs. prophet) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via realization of rival receiver and broadcast reversal, narrowing to split crowd with agency-driven cost of aloneness. One tightening suffices: hoard-to-share deepens pressure coherently. Minor abstractness in "dozens branching futures" slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of variant allegiance emerges organically from fragments-as-doors vs. walls, resonating in non-literal end image of open dawn without moralizing. Subtext in shadows' neutrality charges Elara's arc; ambiguity lingers in "what might grow." Final beans/awaiting dawn reweights prophecy as choice seed catalog.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: whimsical grit in "talked to weather patterns like they owed her money," modulating rhythm under reflective pressure. Prose texture distinct in syntax variety, lyric compression taught early via fragments. No head-hopping; inference matches Elara's knowledge bounds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels: sentences multi-job via image/action (e.g., "lightning painted her face blue"), rhythm varies read-aloud with purposeful lyric swells. Zero loops; metaphors cohere (shadows stretch per light). Minor figurative density in opening holds as pattern-taught for tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: radio shadows as neutral prophecy designers, transformed via cobalt amplifier and seed catalog CR, inevitable in hindsight from fragment buildup. Bold risk in accumulative reflection-without-action heightens stakes via isolation cost. No template echoes; gritty whimsy particularizes tropes organically.</comment>
