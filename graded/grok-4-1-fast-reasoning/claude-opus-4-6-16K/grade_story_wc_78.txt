<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like feeling resonance in molars during strikes; motivation to repurpose obstacles compels climax action with visible strain. No deep contradictory impulses shown simultaneously, but competence balanced by genuine wave struggle earns high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cloud reading to fractal signal to dubbed counter-rhythm climax. Charged Poise closure in "the orchard rose...new current" with cost legible in trembling mallet and physical exertion; orientation anchored early in orchard raft/blue hour.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Driftwood logs, root-cables, and salt-sweet apples constrain choices and charge final palm-on-trunk vibration; sensory hierarchy (tones in teeth/feet, slick feet) reflects urgency. Final image reweights setting as living instrument.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake of tide convergence tightens via fractal clouds forcing counter-rhythm dubbing; agency peaks in central root-cable strike amid groaning trees. Cost unmistakable in raft tilt/groan and her hard breathing, narrowing shatter-or-lift options under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of obstacles-as-instruments emerges organically from repurposed orchard/mallet to climax euphony; final whisper nearly echoes thesis but image of humming trunk recharges without moralizing. Resists tidy resolution via restless note's dissonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in cloud "calligraphy" and tone "sketches"; rhythmic modulation accelerates in rapid strikes/climax. Distinct lyric texture fits synesthetic world without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., strikes advance resonance mapping and plot); varied rhythm propels to "enormous...euphony" peak without loops or figurative muddle. No scaffolds; purposeful metaphors taught early cohere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating orchard prophet and mallet-dubbed tides synthesize fresh synesthesia from disaster tropes; risk of sonic-world logic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via first principle. No derivatives; bold premise fully committed.</comment>
