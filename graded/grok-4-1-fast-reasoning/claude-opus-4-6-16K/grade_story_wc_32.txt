<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in breaking the ember she swore to preserve, earning the final choice with embodied cost in her "smallest fracture of a smile"; stoically sensitive trait constrains actions consistently without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via successive failures to pattern break at hammer strike; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with shatter-then-reform cost legible in "dark powder" moment before glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus pyroclastic veins constrain choices by supplying dead coals; recurring "frozen bloom" motif charges final image, filtering through Maren's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vivifying embers tightens via crozier insight forcing break; agency in hammer strike forecloses preservation path with visible shatter cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation via destruction emerges from particulars like warped crozier geometries; final shards orbiting reconfigures preservation premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity on "something new."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward fire's "arrested, irreversible" beauty; rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "It shattered" reversal, stable single POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in "powder began to glow... like frost climbing a windowpane" propels without loops; minor overwrite in opening stacked metaphors ("frozen bloom... perpetual dusk") slightly dulls early propulsion but purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy twist transforms preservation trope via breaking for "new architecture"; risk of crozier as catalyst heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
