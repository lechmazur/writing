<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (bewilderment vs. curator instinct to classify) act in scene; final carving choice earned by journal chain and mirror realization with embodied cost ("vertebra by vertebra"). Interiority particular and embodied; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of impossibilities (orchard air, journals) builds to on-page CR closure (realizes backward inheritance, begins carving) with conceptual cost (disquiet of endless chain). Orientation anchored early; pattern taught via nonlinear journals pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard/trees constrain revelation and charge final image (sits under largest tree to carve); bathroom micro-setting forces intimate breakthrough. Sensory details (honey/static, pulsing fruit) selective via POV bias, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity for cameo) signaled early, tightens via mirror deepening that reconfigures knowledge/options under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in disquiet and carving commitment foreclosing endpoint illusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of backward-inherited love emerges organically from particulars (journals, cameo chain); final image (carving under tree) offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting linearity premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (eyes refusing classification, light threading veins); rhythmic control heightens realizations, elision of future journal taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "light changed quality... rearrangement... vertebra by vertebra"); zero loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful and consistent without muddle in peak bathroom beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms time/memory tropes via pistachio cameo chain and nonlinear journals into inevitable synthesis; bold risk in backward inheritance premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
