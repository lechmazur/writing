<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal shift from forging mother's hand to writing her own line reveals contradictory impulses toward completion and truth, earned by wrist-tremor rehearsal with geological chest-weight release as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (aurora shifts, drips) builds to CR closure: "The key was not meant to open anything. It was meant to unlink," reconfiguring grief with on-page emotional cost in key abandonment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora's jade-to-amethyst pulses and stalactite drips constrain patient endurance, mirroring internal release and charging final walkout image under rippling sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to complete letter tightens via key insight under Accumulative lens, forcing agency in non-forgery line and key-leaving with identity-cost foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forged-line addition ("I forgive what you could not finish") and key drop reweight completion-as-tyranny premise non-literally, emerging from thorn-ink act without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in "ink gleamed wet... dark as the thorn" propels without loops; syntax varies naturally, charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Key reinterpretation as "unlink" synthesizes forger's precision with forgiveness in fresh, inevitable CR, risking quiet stasis over tidy revelation.</comment>
