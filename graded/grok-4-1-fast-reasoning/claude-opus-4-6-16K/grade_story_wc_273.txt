<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in "calm fury that was half meditation and half defiance" act simultaneously under pressure, earning the hand-through-ink choice that forecloses self-disappearance with sister-prioritizing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain from deliberate ink spill to patterns aligning to time-thickening DC lands on-page closure with self-risk cost; drone footage image reconfigures rescue as evidentiary reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment ("sculpture and wound") and sideways flames constrain site choice and mirror inner wildness, charging the ink-reach final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to retrieve Maren escalates via causal tightening (patterns sharpen, time thickens), driven by Sable's agency in hand placement risking "fingers thinning into light."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final dual-women image offers resonant answer to time-slowing premise, reweighting wildness-meets-wildness without moralizing, emerging from ink events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("holding a scream between her teeth") biases toward serene anger, with rhythmic modulation in peak "time screamed to a halt."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; high density in "ink climbed her wrist in vanishing script" propels closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Squid-melanin ink as eclipse-timed portal synthesizes temporal physics non-obviously, transforming rescue trope via crisis-time exploitation inevitable at hand-grasp climax.</comment>
