<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—rigorous myth-busting driven by desperate hope—embody throughout, culminating in earned acceptance of an unbreakable myth at "She had found the one myth she could not break," with felt cost of entangled grief and gratitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of shell's voice and cello's hums builds to on-page Conceptual Repricing at "what remains... is the retelling itself," with cost in fading shell and voluntary placement back on ledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory's cracked dome, rusted gears, and smeared star charts constrain discovery and charge final image of "observatory existed inside the whisper of closing pages"; selective sensory details (warm shell, salt fog) mirror internal dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early tightens via shell's reconstruction and cello's deepening, forcing renunciation of skepticism with legible cost in "grief and gratitude so entangled"; Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of reconstruction from dissolution emerges organically via shell/cello interplay, offering resonant answer in final image of placing shell "for the next seeker" without moralizing; reweights myth-busting premise with conceptual cost of ephemerality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (myths as "beautiful lies," star charts as "unnamed smears of longing"); rhythmic modulation heightens realization without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "sea wind pour through like breath into a flute"); zero loops or scaffolds, clarity intact at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms myth-busting trope via ephemeral compass as self-breaking myth of retelling; bold lyric risk in Accumulative design heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at shell's fade and voluntary return.</comment>
