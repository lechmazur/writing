<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's motivation roots deeply in her systematic trait and diagnosis-driven resolve, compelling micro-choices like copper wiring that earn her final endurance among the roots. Interiority embodied in dirt hands and diary sketches reveals character without epiphanies. Final choice to close diary and sit shows hierarchy of values with her life's cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from diagnosis to four-month success, culminating in Charged Poise CR as wires removed and she sits, reweighting her life into orchard's form with death's cost undeniable in final image. Orientation anchors by para 2 (island, temple orchard). One tightening via her impatience burning observation into action suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lithite pillars and oaks as "negotiated" architecture constrain remodeling choices (choking roots force wires) and charge closure image of intertwined roots/veins in marble. Sensory hierarchy (electrical signals, softened stone) filters through caretaker bias. Final canopy light columns mirror pillar motif purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard remodel before death) signaled para 1, escalates accumulatively as two-year estrangement meets six-month clock, forcing agency in wiring; success tightens to her ending, with opportunity cost felt in diary's final pages over self-writing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect emerges from particulars (braided trunk/stone, softened channels), answered non-literally in new archways and her unwritten autobiography, reweighting premise without moralizing. Orchard as "slow dialogue" motif charges closure without token recurrence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (botanical precision: "root spread, canopy angle") biases noticing toward lithite-oak signals. Voice texture modulates rhythm from measured diary to brazen calm in final circuit walk. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "pillars were calcium deposits... compelled by some biological imperative" packs world/mechanics seamlessly); rhythm varies (long accumulating sentences to short final image). Zero loops, coherent metaphors ("time were a room," "autobiography now"); propulsion peaks at wire removal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lithite biology, copper conduction, and dying caretaker's legacy transforms ecological trope into inevitable CR. Risk in "remodel" metaphor heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, premise commits fully to living architecture implications.</comment>
