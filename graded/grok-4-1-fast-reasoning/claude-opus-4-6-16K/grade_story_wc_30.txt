<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the forge scene ("instinct was to reject... clung to the version... that made sense"), compelling the earned acceptance with embodied cost via titan-gear strain; interiority particular and flawed without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine density breaks with creel/note, tightening to smelting visions and CR closure in the disc's forging ("means continuation") with honesty cost legible on-page; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal atrium as micro-setting constrains choices (tides deliver creel, forge repairs) and charges final image ("winter sunlight moved across the flooded floor"); sensory details (salt-crusted doors, kelp nest) selectively POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. timeless stasis) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via creel visions narrowing to acceptance trade-off; agency in smelting/forge honesty forecloses singular-self path with felt cost, charging poise at "Now."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of continuation-through-contradiction emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR in disc symbol and shelving act reweighting premise without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer to eternal present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (sea-tide rhythms, gear hum) with rhythmic control modulating pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure image, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring tide rhythms; peak forge beat vivid without overwriting, read-aloud ear flawless in "molten metal settled into a single gleaming disc."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library, calendrical collapse, and migrating selves via titan-gear transforms tropes organically; risk in moon-fluctuating exoskeleton heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at forging.</comment>
