<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in leaving a trail despite seeking escape, earning the final choice to carry guilt forward; embodied guilt (flares white-hot at "They trusted you") particularizes Maren without therapy-speak. Oren's pressure reveals her past authentically. Closure choice feels inevitable from prior micro-choices in the labyrinth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumbs (newspaper, baseball) densify toward lake vision as resonant reconfiguration, reweighting guilt with cost in "She could not undo... but carry it forward." One tightening at vision suffices; no orientation debt as procedure/recovery anchors early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains path choices and charges final image ("chose the next path"); "jaded wonder" filters sensory hierarchy (ethereal light aches chest). Selective details (slick rungs, rope bridges) evolve with descent, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (confront unforgivable past) signaled via guilt, escalates accumulatively through paths/photos to vision reversal; agency in sitting/choosing crystallizes stance with legible cost (weeping for ghosts forecloses escape). Persistent baseball constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (guilt as compass) emerges from lake faces shifting "unforgivable" to navigable; final image non-literally answers escape-vs-empathy without moralizing, reweighting premise via "open hands." Subtext in Oren's "time is a suggestion" enriches without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual bias ("beauty felt worn"); voice rhythmic, modulating from copper-taste grit to glowing poise. Dialogue subtextual ("You gave that... or you will") pursues revelation; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "soft, breathing glow" advances setting/action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("second sky turned liquid"). Propulsion peaks clean at vision without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms memory-wipe trope via guilt's persistence and time-loop baseball into fresh sci-fi empathy quest; labyrinth lake synthesis inevitable from newspaper breadcrumbs, risking "jaded wonder" tone that heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
