<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in insomnia and post-war trauma, with contradictory stubbornness (refusing brooch trade) compelling collaborative choice; earned change from isolation to covenant via pigment exchange. Micro-choices like offering cadmium reveal values hierarchy with irreplaceable cost. Distinct voices in sparse dialogue maintain character-specific idiom under shared purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise closure: joint mural and promise reconfigure isolation into shared endurance, cost legible in tide's return ("rain trails reversed") and left unfinished work. Orientation anchored immediately in mud flats and causeway. Single scene with no shards adheres perfectly, one tightening via encounter suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices via tide clock and rain trails, charging final image of shared crossing; micro-details like "mineral pigment and old stone and... brine" evolve tactilely. POV-filtered sensory hierarchy (artist notices paint stains first) mirrors priorities. Tidal island as crucible forces timed collaboration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning amid ruin) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via encounter and pigment exchange narrowing isolation; agency in brooch show and joint painting forecloses solo path with tide cost. One decisive deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration pre-meeting holds from 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of art's stubborn endurance emerges organically from convergence mural merging perspectives, subtext in irreplaceable pigments and brooch glow. Final image ("stubbornly bearing it forward") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting catastrophe. No moralizing; ambiguity in unfinished mural lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (rain trails as stories); voice modulates rhythm from haggard description to precise dialogue subtext ("unearthed convergence" correction). Dialogue goal-driven, advances plot naturally. Prose texture reflects insomniac clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; purposeful metaphors ("tooth from rotting jaw") taught early without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; every line multi-jobs (e.g., "rain trails carved temporary channels" advances plot, setting, stakes). Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc via pigment-trading insomniacs on tidal isle, rain trails as ingenious timer transforming survival trope. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; brooch/mural convergence feels inevitable from particulars. Non-obvious moral calculus in hoarded color elevates.</comment>
