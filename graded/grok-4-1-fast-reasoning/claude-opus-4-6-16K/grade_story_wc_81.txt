<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via enthusiasm clashing with disciplined readjustment; final indexing choice earned by methodical testing with career cost felt in "the truth will cost something." Interiority concrete and particular to indexer's eye.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: evidence density builds from cabinet seal to hypothesis tests, landing CR closure in indexing act with legible cost ("contract would likely end"); orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent kelp and settling sediment constrain choices (glow enables work, stillness sharpens focus) and charge final image (silence holds words "like water holds a stone"); sensory hierarchy POV-filtered perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honest origins) tightens accumulatively via evidence deepening against consortium theory; agency in alternative tests forecloses bias path, cost visible in anticipated professional fallout charging poised end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of obscured origins emerges organically from stamp's predating etchings and ledger's originality; final writing image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing, embracing complexity of "someone... worked to obscure."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in indexer's precise parsing ("parse the structure"); rhythmic control modulates from hushed description to resolute close, POV stable and biased toward textual evidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "The seal gave way" advances plot and evokes age); zero loops, varied rhythm propels to closure image unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of textual forensics in sunken archaeology transforms trope into inevitable discovery turn; risk in quiet, solitary resolve heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
