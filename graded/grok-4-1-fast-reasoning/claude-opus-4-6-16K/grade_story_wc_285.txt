<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fen's contradictory impulses—regrets overwriting promises vs. attentiveness to the living world—act in scene via needle-turning and waiting ritual, earning his final offer with visible cost of partial restoration. Interiority concrete via yarn needle habit. Woman's shadow presence applies secondary pressure through sensed alertness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fog/ticking layers to silence enabling door-open offer, landing Charged Poise closure as ferry emerges, reconfiguring her search with irretrievability cost legible in "some things cannot be restored, only retraced." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-bound planks/river constrains wait and charges ferry emergence image; ticking gutters evolve causally into silence, mirroring internal palimpsest. Sensory hierarchy (sound over sight in fog) reflects coachman's ambient awareness. Heron call subtly tensions serenity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—woman's obscured search vs. erased road—tightens accumulatively when her words prompt Fen's realization, narrowing to retrace option with felt cost of loss. Agency in his timed offer/endurance forecloses full restoration. Pressure coheres subtly via fog delay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Palimpsest theme emerges organically from fog layers, overwritten vows, needle eye, reweighted in her nod as "one more layer of ink," offering non-literal answer to grief's endurance without moralizing. Subtext in her four words vs. his understanding invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: ambient awareness biases noticing (passenger tension, weather). Lyrical rhythm modulates from ticking accumulation to serene ferry image; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You remember it").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors cohere (palimpsest fog/needle/soul) without muddle, propelling to silence beat. No loops/artifacts; "the fog breathed" integrates sensory propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coachman's sensed intuition transforms erased-road trope into palimpsest retracing, risking lyric slowness paid by charged ferry closure. Non-obvious angle on grief via yarn needle distills ingenuity.</comment>
