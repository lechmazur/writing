<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete, particular embodiment of unreliable memories driving micro-choices like third-person writing; contradictory impulses (claim identity vs. ghost endurance) act in the final writing scene, earning the closure renunciation with visible cost of unverified past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from fragment collection to CR closure in notebook placement and final image of presence amid erasure; cost legible in "choosing not to correct the error," reweighting options with undeniable conceptual price; orientation anchored early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Towering containers and tides as micro-setting constrain choices (high-tide solitude enables listening) and charge final image ("tide retreat, carrying... secrets seaward"); sensory details (rust, salt air, lapping water) filtered through POV bias, purposeful and vivid without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory verification escalates texturally via density increase from overhearing to self-layering in notebook, narrowing to Charged Poise endurance; agency in collecting/writing forecloses correction path with felt erasure cost, legible in warehouse faint echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from fragment mosaics, culminating in resonant non-literal answer—"more present than... officially alive"—reweighting premise without moralizing; final notebook image shifts prior layers' meaning with lingering ambiguity on remembrance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "texture" of voices/memories (grain of confession, smooth lie); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to compressed introspection under erasure pressure; stable single POV with purposeful elision teaching textural pattern, paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing texture/atmosphere (e.g., "metal cathedral" purposeful, not muddled); zero loops, varied syntax propels to closure image without scaffold; read-aloud rhythm breathes with tides, no artifacts dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic ghost trope via textural eavesdropping archaeology transforms into bold CR on presence; risk in nameless, non-causal mosaic heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from container labyrinth constraint.</comment>
