<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Esoteric realist traits drive specific micro-choices like deliberate knots and dismantling, earning the archival resolution with embodied cost in aching fingers and impermanent structures. Contradictory impulses surface in favoring gestures over permanence, shown through building then untying. Final endurance forecloses permanence with felt cost in the moth wing's tremble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from unpacking to structures, butterfly arrival, dismantling; Conceptual Repricing closure in descending with journal/moth wing reweights transient gestures against lasting record with conceptual cost of last migration. Orientation anchored early in grotto/climb. One tightening at monarch landing narrows to final gesture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's verdant walls and altitude constrain choices (aching fingers in knots), charge final descent image; sensory details (weeping condensation, alpenglow) selective via POV bias toward overlooked specifics. Micro-setting of bamboo/silk integrates into action, mirroring internal transience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor Dawa via gesture for last monarchs) signaled early, tightens at butterfly wrist-landing forcing stillness/scale gift; agency in waiting/dismantling forecloses permanence with on-page cost of collapse. Pressure coheres accumulatively, cost legible in frayed knot's moth wing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence theme emerges organically from building/dismantling, reweighted in final journal image offering non-literal answer to honoring invisibles via transients. Resonance from particulars like scale/moth wing avoids moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable from thematic impermanence vs. archive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in granular noticing (wing precision, knot language); rhythmic control modulates with pressure, compressing at dusk arrival. Stable close third-person; purposeful compression in gestures legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tied each knot with fingers that ached... feeling the structures become real"); zero loops, varied rhythm accelerates in building/waiting. Metaphors coherent (cupped palm, floating embers), no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of esoteric realism, cloud-grotto signals for extinct migration honors forgotten cartographer; risk in lyric transience vs. archive inevitability heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes (last migration) via granular Dawa journal feels organic, non-obvious.</comment>
