<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vela's grounded patience and craft-specific interiority compel the climax choice, embodied in mirror-grinding and calibration; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the breathing beat, muting peak emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from backstory shards to frost climax; Charged Poise closure lands cleanly when "the image held" with fog's return as conceptual cost, reconfiguring longing into resonance without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frost-needles and calcified trees constrain calibration choices and charge the final gleaming sextant; selective sensory hierarchy (light-bending haze) mirrors Vela's priorities, evolving causally into prismatic corridors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early tightens via patient calibration to synchronized breathing agency, foreclosing force-trapping for resonance under Accumulative lens; cost legible in fog's patient return post-victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of boundary-erasure emerges organically from mirror-craft and sextant reversal, resonating in final image of blossoms "falling upward into a sky made entirely of glass" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in light-angle obsession; rhythmic modulation peaks in breathing sync, diction controlled and biased toward glassy refraction without elision needs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (e.g., "ice needles"); no loops or scaffolds, read-aloud rhythm breathes with frost pulse to closure gleam.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sextant-as-boundary-dissolver synthesizes mirrors/dreams ingeniously, transforming ruin-restoration trope through resonant breathing; risk in reverse-calibration pays off in inevitable hindsight.</comment>
