<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through sensory textures (gravel, hum); earnest studiousness embarrasses but drives ritual endurance with embodied cost in "restrained brightness." Contradictory impulses act in writing the invented history, earning final renunciation of fixity. Final parallel to grandmother's trees reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory impressions builds to Charged Poise closure in final image of Sable amid bonsai, reweighting time-shaping with conceptual cost of unchosen forms. Orientation anchors early (Sable's climb at 3am). No causality breaks; pattern taught via notepad fragments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth constrains navigation ("texture of gravel") and charges final image ("small, patient trees...forms they would never have chosen"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (wisteria brushing shoulders, hum pitch shifts). Micro-setting (lamp, bench) evolves with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing temporal texture) signaled early, deepens texturally via writing beat ("jar...empty and warm") that narrows to restraint; hum shift forces crystallization. Cost legible in "glow contained within its own precision," charging poise. Agency in dawn ritual under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of vibrating possibilities emerges via particulars (invented histories, hum threshold, bonsai parallel); final image reweights premise non-literally ("not so different from what she does with time"). Subtext in "true...in the way that matters," avoiding morals. Resonance from refracted archive gaps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (textures, eras' rhythms); diction/rhythm modulate to incantatory precision at writing ("luminous but held back"). Voice embodies studiousness without filter excess; syntax reflects threshold states.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short hum sentences to flowing paths); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures ("bending...through the lens"). Propulsion peaks in writing beat; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gilded-leaf trade + bonsai inheritance + fluorescent hum for temporal texture transforms archival trope into vibrating histories. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in tree-time parallel; no derivatives, inevitable hindsight.</comment>
