<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Solemn archivist's obsession rooted in "truth was a debt the present owed the dead" drives micro-choices like transcribing and planning descent; embodied visions create contradictory impulses of reverence and personal cost, earning final endurance without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visions and cipher-breaking density reconfigure knowledge toward Charged Poise closure; "cipher broke open on the thirty-ninth day" delivers legible cost in sustained tethering, with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon contours constrain cipher solution and charge final search image; zeppelin's "coolest and lightless" archive mirrors isolation, filtering through Miriam's priorities without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding/erasing erasure tightens via visions' deepening ("felt the salt wind"), forcing endurance with isolation cost; agency in persistence forecloses detachment, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of honoring buried truths emerges from particulars like scarified leader's warnings, reweighted in final "witness who would not look away" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature ("whispered to the letters") modulates rhythm with intensity; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged final image, stable POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("gondola swollen with shelves"); no loops or artifacts dull closure's "searing reverie," rhythmic control peaks without overwrites.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition and lagoon-key cipher transforms archival trope; risk in visionary immersion heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
