<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marguerite's synesthetic interiority and love of encores compel her intervention, with contradictory solitude vs. connection acting in the singing/coin drop; final endurance of fractured existence as peace carries visible cost. Darla's minimal but embodied despair syncs perfectly. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices like pressing coin to hedge reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes and timeline layers builds to coin parting hedge as RR/Charged Poise, reconfiguring Marguerite's stake with felt cost of eternal encores ("something she could almost call peace"). Orientation anchored by para 2; one tightening via sensing Darla's breath suffices. No ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard's silver-barked trees and humming apples constrain choices (hedge parts via coin) and charge final image (fruit as open hands); synesthetic filter biases details like "apples sang frequencies that tasted of cinnamon and electric blue." Sensory hierarchy sharpens under ghostly pressure. No white-room; spatial choreography of hedge/orchard clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lure from brink) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via song syncing breaths to coin drop, narrowing options with agency in echoes/method; cost legible in Darla's vertigo shift and Marguerite's sap-like nostalgia. Minor slip: external conflict (locked gate) resolves too neatly without complicating pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of encore as redemptive connection emerges from tarot Fool/Tower, synesthetic echoes, and final orchard image reweighting isolation into charged purpose without moralizing. Subtext in hedge parting implies brink's reciprocity. Resonance from particulars like "vertigo of possibility rather than... falling."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("applause tasted of warm bread") biases noticing distinctively; rhythmic modulation builds to tender orchestral hush at closure. Stable close-third with clean Darla paragraph (no head-hopping). Prose texture controlled, lyric compression taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines like "voice would leave her mouth and split against the fractured timeline" advance sound/character/atmosphere multiply. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative layer purposeful and coherent. Propulsion peaks at coin tumble.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic ghost, timeline fractures, and tarot transforms haunted maze trope into textured redemption arc. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via overlapping eras enabling intervention. Inevitable hindsight: orchard echoes demand the coin's Fool-side gift.</comment>
