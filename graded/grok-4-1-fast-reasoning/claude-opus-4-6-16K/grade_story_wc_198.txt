<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied endurance shines in ritual micro-choices like threading melody through drips; contradictory awareness of limits ("She knows she cannot do this forever") earns final renunciation with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "for as long as her breath holds out, this morning fog saxophonist," reconfiguring daily stake with inevitable process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism atrium and mist constrain/amplify playing tactics; recurring dew/mist charges final image, with sound hierarchy filtering through Maren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) deepens accumulatively when whisper reassembles and she counters with old song; agency forecloses drip-assembly with felt daily cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vested hush emerges organically from "plays around it, into it, threading melody through the negative space"; final image reweights prophecy as ongoing process without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sound-biased perceptual signature ("notes settle into the gaps between the drips") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates ritual pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "colors appearing and dissolving in the vapor like memories"; metaphors coherent and propulsive through peak whisper beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sax-hushing drip-prophecy via negative space transforms folklore ingeniously; risk-taking in lyric accumulation feels inevitable, heightening endurance stakes.</comment>
