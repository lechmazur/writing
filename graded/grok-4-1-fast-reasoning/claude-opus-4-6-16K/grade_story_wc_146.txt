<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tuner’s cryptic patience shown concretely through half-phrases and deliberate rhythms compels higher-stakes choices like dusk walks; Elske’s shift from wariness to emulation earns change with felt cost in final walk. Minor lack of embodied contradictory impulses in tuner (competence over struggle) prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: resonance builds from fork strikes to footstep rhythms to bell ring, yielding Charged Poise closure where town reconfigures with conceptual cost of ongoing intention (“provided anyone remembered”). Orientation anchors early; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobblestones as pitch-varying instrument constrain tuner’s dusk walks and charge final image of Elske’s precise steps; archway cups echoes to mirror theme. Sensory hierarchy (vibration in ankles/sternum) filters through characters’ priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert subsidence via retuning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as engineers’ reversal forces stance crystallization in bell strike. Tuner’s agency in rhythm narrows options with time pressure cost; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of restoring balance emerges implicitly from tuning progression to “shared balance” correction, answered non-literally in town’s “tentative song” and Elske’s walk. Resonance reweights prior silences without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sound-biased perceptual signature (“frequency at which its foundations had been set”) modulates rhythmically under pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (“I knew about the imbalance”); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., “cobblestones, laid centuries ago in spiraling paths... designed as an instrument” advances setting/plot/voice); rhythmic variety matches theme, zero loops or muddled figures in peak bell-strike beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of town-as-instrument premise transformed via earth-bone fork and footstep mechanics; risk of poetic conceit heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
