<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in withholding truth while tossing stones act in scene; final revelation earned by prior micro-choices like pebble pile and patient threading. Boy's ancient calm in child's body embodied via "seven-year-old teeth and seventy years of knowing." Maren's shift from terror to reaching hand shows credible endurance with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ripple patterns accumulate density to CR closure where vanishing reconfigures as arrival. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via colliding rings forces knowledge shift. Final stone toss pays off persistent constraint of delayed reveal with felt conceptual cost in "open and reaching" hand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic basalt constrains ripples into unique geometries that teach pattern, charging final image; translucent hand filters starlight/minerals purposefully. Sensory hierarchy via boy's slow thoughts from iron-pull mirrors reversal trait. Grotto evolves with rings kissing walls, mirroring internal redistribution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframing vanishing fear) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via stone tosses narrowing from "terror" to acceptance; agency in boy's withholding/ tossing forecloses fear path. Cost legible in Maren's caught breath and open hand under lens. No slips touch closure cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redistribution emerges organically from rings returning "changed," reweighting premise in final "arrival" without moralizing. Returning ripple motif charges closure image, resisting tidy binaries via doorway/not ending ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from vanishing-as-arrival question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited on boy with perceptual signature of slow-honey thoughts and eerie child-voice calm; dialogue subtextual ("You think I came here to cure this") advances goal. Rhythmic control modulates with trance density; no head-hopping, elisions taught via ripples.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., ripples as plot/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm passes ear test. Figurative language coherent/pattern-taught via rings (no muddle), but slight overwriting density in opening descriptions prevents 9+. No loops, clear propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reverse-aging researcher synthesizing backward bibliography with ripple physics transforms tropes organically; fresh CR via transparency as "outermost ring." Risk-taking in child-elder POV heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via withheld truth payoff.</comment>
