<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in harp's distortion mirroring the dead's time and embodied motivation via warming tooth compel steady choices; modestly fearless trait enables sitting in multiplied sobs without premature fix. Final affirmation of purpose earned through weaving laughter, foreclosing unintegrated grief path with felt cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes, confessions, sobs to laughter integration tightens to RR/Charged Poise closure in final image of luminous ache and trembling silence, reconfiguring purpose with undeniable impermanence cost—"precious because it would not last." Orientation anchored early in gorge descent; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gorge's sound-holding physics (loosely, tremblingly) constrains confessions and amplifies grief/laughter; sunrise progression from diffuse glow to flooding gold charges final image, mirroring internal healing. Sensory hierarchy (sound dominant) reflects Maren's priorities; micro-setting of harp and tooth evolve tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of soul-release via laughter integration signaled early, texturally escalates through sob choir to chord-woven laugh narrowing grief options; agency in question "What made you laugh?" forces deepening with tooth-warming cost felt on page. Quiet endurance of impermanence charges poise without overt reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of joy's indelibility amid unsaid grief emerges organically from confession particulars, sob-laughter weave, and tooth's submersion-not-drowning reminder; final silence-as-gorge reweights premise with luminous ache's conceptual cost, inviting ambiguity without tidy moral. Resonant non-literal answer in birds' perfect tune contrasting harp.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in sound distortions and biased noticing (echo persistence over visuals initially); rhythmic diction modulates from hushed descent to aching glow. Lyrical compression taught early via metaphors pays off legibly at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gorge held sound the way a cupped hand holds water" anchors voice/setting/stakes); varied rhythm accelerates in confession build without loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Clean propulsion; final line recharges opening motif seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral healing via misaligned harp distortion and laughter integration transforms ghost-trope into textured purpose; crocodile tooth's breath-holding logic grounds talisman uniquely. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes of impermanence without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
