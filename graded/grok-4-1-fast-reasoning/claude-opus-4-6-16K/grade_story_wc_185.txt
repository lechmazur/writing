<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vael's expertise as mapkeeper drives micro-choices like reading ice cracks, embodied in "teeth ache" and "body like a bell"; motivation intensifies to invocation without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, limiting 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory chaos densifies to hush bloom; Charged Poise closure in "hush bloomed... new ones formed: gentler, rounder" reconfigures coexistence with "trembling line" endurance cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cracks as "frozen record" constrain hush discovery; caves' quartz "rivers of pale fire" and final "gently luminous dark" charge mapping image, filtering via Vael's ripple expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find "bloom of hush" tightens texturally via ice-map narrowing options; agency in stone invocation forecloses destruction path with "negotiation of coexistence" cost legible at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coexistence theme emerges via beings' shift from scream to "whisper"; final "charted the new peace one trembling line" non-literally reweights storm premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with ripple-language signature ("ripple marks... like sentences"); rhythm shifts from "hammered repose" to "almost like breathing," modulating pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in "sound... hammered repose that struck her body like a bell"; zero loops or scaffolds, propulsion peaks at "hush bloomed" with varied syntax and sensory propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wave interference as coexistence physics transforms invasion trope; ice-crack mapping to echo stone yields inevitable "negotiation" turn, fresh synthesis risking lyric sound-world payoff.</comment>
