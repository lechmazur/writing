<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority particular to tuner (frequencies felt in sternum); motivation rooted in traits intensifies via world contrast; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, but endurance of craft earned with visible cost in ongoing tuning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to CR closure in final line ("every spectrum said... stay awake to this"), reweighting fading wonder with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment and kinetic sculpture function as micro-settings constraining craft choices and charging final image of scattered spectra; sensory details (wind vanes, hammer intervals) vivid, selective via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. efficiency) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through visitor reactions and sculpture's "symphonies"; coherent pressure reweights via pattern break in tears/recognition; cost of wonder's fade legible in Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential response emerges organically from particulars (sculpture stripping lies, visitor tears); final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("stay awake to this") reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with distinct perceptual signature (tuned to sternum frequencies, light spectra); rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts (e.g., no paraphrase churn); figurative language pattern-taught early coheres without muddle; propulsion aligns with accumulative needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-language world, bell-tuning craft, and iceberg sculpture transforms lyric vignette into inevitable resonance; risk-taking in muted lyric structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
