<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of grief, rage, and love act simultaneously in the letter-reading scene, embodied in shaking hands and cracking voice; final endurance of the breaking/healing cycle is earned through prior ritual causality with the felt cost of an empty box.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of ritual (shard mending, letters read, condensation messages) tightening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "It breaks again every dawn... That is not failure. That is devotion," reconfiguring grief into devotion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mangrove roots and singing spirits constrain navigation and charge ritual; shard as micro-setting evolves to constrain final choice, mirroring internal states in the mending/breaking under moonlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reaching the "moment before deciding" deepens via letter-reading reversal (mother's messages appear), driven by Maren's agency; cost unmistakable in empty box and cyclic devotion foreclosing tidy forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of overlapping silences emerges organically from ritual particulars; final shard image offers resonant answer to forgiveness quest, reweighting breakage as devotion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "tones that pressed against the chest like a hand holding a cracked thing together"; stable close third-person limited with rhythmic modulation under ritual pressure, sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (gargoyle's anguished face mends then cracks), propulsion peaks in condensation messages without overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove ritual, mending gargoyle shard, and condensation messages transforms grief tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
