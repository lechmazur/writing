<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glazier's interiority shines through concrete glass/ripple analogies revealing contradictory impulses to understand yet not intervene, earning the final renunciation; embodied emotions in pebble-weighing build to felt cost of patience. Specific trait integration avoids stock phrasing. Minor rationalizing in daughter reflection doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ripple throws building density to Charged Poise closure in final stone drop—"proof that even the smallest gesture disturbs the whole world"—with conceptual cost of watching arrival legible on-page. Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint of dawn hour shapes reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pearl Bay dawn and prism atrium constrain observation and charge final image via light refraction mirroring internal stakes; sensory hierarchy (noctilucent ripples, mist-breathing glass) filters through glazier bias. Evolving mist/pectra evolution ties to theme without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reading daughter's return via ripples escalates accumulatively through intersecting rings/deepening kiln analogy, narrowing to endurance choice with visible cost of foreclosed intervention; final patience reweights under lens. One tightening sufficient; agency in throws tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of illuminating mundane emerges organically via ripple-glass motifs shifting to resonant answer in final image, reweighting departure as radiating pattern without moralizing; subtext in "spaces between" invites ambiguity on change's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light-bending grammar) and rhythmic modulation heighten reflective pressure; stable single POV with biased noticing (ripples as "grammar of consequence"). Prose texture reflects glazier mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful ripple repetition taught early pays off at closure; varied rhythm/syntax propel without loops or muddled metaphors—glass/ring vehicles cohere. Minor long-sentence runs in reflection don't obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh glazier-ripple synthesis transforms daughter-return trope into inevitable conceptual repricing; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via dawn constraint without gimmickry.</comment>
