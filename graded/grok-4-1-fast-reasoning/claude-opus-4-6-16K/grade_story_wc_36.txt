<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maret's motivation to harvest insights from failure drives consistent micro-choices like precise marker arrangements, embodied in knee ache and trembling fingers. Interiority particularizes her reverence for silence and past loss without stock epiphanies. Blind spot in guardianship failure compounds into competent struggle, earning the final crossing; minor summary tilt in backstory reflection anchors to present but slightly flattens peak impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of preparations and crossings (eleven noted) tightens to Charged Poise closure as she steps through with final marker, reconfiguring failure into pursuit. Orientation anchors early (scree slope, Thunder-echo hush). Cost legible in "pointing home" amid recognition of Lament's caller, foreclosing safe return path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy: silence presses "like packed snow," driftwood pale against granite constrains returns, luminous stone/copper air differentiates worlds. Environment charges final image of pulsing Lament valley. POV bias filters glacial driftwood as ancient/relic-like, mirroring her guardianship loss without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover Lament via crossings) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through eleven prior lessons culminating in "today she meant to answer that caller." Agency in flute-playing step-through forecloses retreat with marker cost. Minor abstractness in "insights" but on-page tightening narrows to confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of failure as "open door" emerges organically from relic loss to world-weaving pursuit, resonating in final range silence "like the space between one world and the next." Subtext in flute's warmth/breath memory reweights guardianship without statement. Ambiguity lingers in caller's intent, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature: silence counted "like storms," mountains "avalanchingly quiet." Rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate arrangement to hanging note's fold. No head-hopping or withholding; elision of other side taught early via prior crossings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels: each line integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "air before her opened like a page being turned"). Rhythmic variety in short punchy crossings vs. lyrical hush; no loops, purposeful quiet recurrences teach pattern. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: relic keeper's failure fuels world-weaving via flute/markers, transforming portal fantasy through silence/reverence texture. Risky Charged Poise ending heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable details like "sound like fabric tearing underwater" feel inevitable.</comment>
