<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses shine in the chest-fracture moment upon finding the wheel, earning the resolute final choice; minor abstractness in ghost negotiation avoids perfect 9+ integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via fragment density building to Charged Poise closure in pocketing/standing image, reweighting chronology with erosion cost; orientation anchored early by lagoon/carousel, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lagoon's churning eddies and carousel ribs as dead mechanism constrain Maren's crouch/pull and mirror purposelessness, charging final image; selective sensory bias (vapor on boots, alkaline barnacles) reflects scavenger priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ghost negotiation via fragments) signaled early, tightens via wheel-deepening under Accumulative lens, but abstract cost slightly mutes visceral legibility in peak resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed regrets emerges organically from wheel/shutter click, final image non-literally answering via resolute collection as eroded bridge; resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with fractured syntax/perceptual signature mirroring chronology confusion; rhythmic modulation peaks purposefully in shutter-click illusion, teaching pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; wheel's "toothed plastic disc" specificity exemplifies propulsion, no artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud-lagoon physics and fragment-collection transforms scavenger trope; risk-taking in nonlinear chronology heightens stakes, inevitable in resolute pocket/stand.</comment>
