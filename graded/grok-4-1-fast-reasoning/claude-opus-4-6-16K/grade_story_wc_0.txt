<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the cataloging vs. feeling tension, culminating in the earned renunciation of "she had finally stopped cataloging," with relational cost in the raw phone apology. Interiority particular via pulsar analogies grounded in dust patterns. No unearned epiphanies; change scales perfectly to scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: dust density builds observation-by-observation to CR closure in "stopped cataloging" and pinned photo, reweighting preprocessing stance with humility cost legible in breeze-stirred dust refusal to formalize. Orientation anchored instantly in greenhouse kneel; no shards, pure cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via cracked concrete kneel and bowed frame, charging final breeze image that mirrors internal thaw. Sensory hierarchy scientist-specific (iridescent powder as galaxy filaments). Micro-object dust evolves causally with flood redistribution, mirroring theme without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scientific detachment vs. lived gradualism) signaled early, deepens texturally through dust reading to renunciation tightening options—catalog or feel—with cost in foreclosed emotional inertness via call. Agency in attention shift; pressure coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of gradual accrual emerges implicitly from wing scales to pulsar decay parallels, resonating in cosmic web photo without moralizing. Final image reweights premise: humility from "negligible" acts, inviting ambiguity on science's limits. No platitudes; earned via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (dust as pulsar data); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, punchy realization lines. Phone dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing reconciliation. No head-hopping; diction controlled, scientist-biased.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multitask (e.g., "branching patterns... filamentary structure" advances setting/theme/character). Varied rhythm propels accumulatively; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—dust/galaxy simile integrates flawlessly. Propulsion peaks closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron stars and butterfly dust transforms scientist epiphany trope via inherited ruin's specificity. Risky quiet CR feels inevitable from dust accrual; no derivatives, bold humility arc heightens stakes organically.</comment>
