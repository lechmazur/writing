<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Helix-minded engineer traits drive concrete micro-choices like resin application and headband use, earning the memory reweighting with embodied cost ("background hum she could carry without collapsing"). Contradictory grief/wonder impulses act simultaneously in the repair beat, avoiding tidy resolutions. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("quantumly bound") slightly tempers perfection but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mirror hold to luminous repair, culminating in Charged Poise RR closure ("mirror pressed against her chest") with legible emotional cost. Orientation anchored early ("canyon basin floor"). Single scene fits scope perfectly, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and flat stone constrain choices (mirror placement, periscope angle), charging final hawk image; POV bias filters helical patterns selectively. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactiles/luminescence under transformation urgency. Micro-object (mirror cracks as light channels) functions as setting, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform entangled memories/dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via headband hum and resin glow, narrowing to reweighted grief with agency-driven deepening. Cost unmistakable in "carry without collapsing." One tightening sufficient; enters high band as final image charges under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from mirror repair and memory shift, final image ("spiral of a thermal carried something upward") offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars like helical fracture reweight premise. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("helical pattern in everything") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens reverie (long sentences build to short closure punch). Stable single POV, no elision or head-hopping. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative density peaks in repair beat ("diaspora of small ghosts," "quantumly bound") risks minor muddle without full pattern payoff, docking from 9+. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts touch closure; rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural headband, luminescent resin, and periscope transforms grief tropes into helix-patterned transformation; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on memory archaeology feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
