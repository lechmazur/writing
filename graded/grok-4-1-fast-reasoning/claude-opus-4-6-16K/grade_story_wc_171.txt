<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied exhaustion (tremor in hand) and contradictory impulses (disbelieves astrology but leverages it); final endurance of flawed peace earned through micro-choices like weeping with Deshani. Voice coherent and specific. Minor reflection anchored without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual leverage accumulates to signing (DC) and reweighted clipboard mark (RR) with compromise cost legible in "dirty ledger." Single scene oriented early; closure charged by terrace image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory integration (warm ebony, torchlight acoustics) constrains choices; terrace and clipboard charge final glow image, mirroring flawed endurance. POV bias sharpens negotiator's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end war via imperfect terms) tightens accumulatively through emotional cracks (Touhl's voice, Deshani's tears), forcing agency in concessions; cost visible in displaced civilians and amnesty, charging signing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges organically from particulars (scarred clipboard shifts to success mark); final "beautiful ugly thing" reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity on adequacy vs. heroism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (arithmetic of suffering); minimal dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing pressure. Rhythm modulates with intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts; metaphors coherent (planets' indifference). Propulsion peaks in negotiation summary without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weary negotiator and celestial ritual transforms diplomacy trope; clipboard tally and "ugly beauty" inflection inevitable from priors, bold quiet closure.</comment>
