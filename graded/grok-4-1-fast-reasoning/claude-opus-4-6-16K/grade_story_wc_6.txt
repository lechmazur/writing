<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied compassion (e.g., "gracefully alert" tuning senses) and contradictory impulses (rage transmuted via grafting); final endurance earned by ritual micro-choices, foreclosing rage with felt cost of perpetual waiting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to graft to coin vigil, yielding Charged Poise closure in "the stillness was enough," with legible cost of spring return etched in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcanic specifics (black glass cliffs, vein-channel) constrain actions (ledge planting) and charge closure image; sensory hierarchy (salt air, pulse in reflection) mirrors internal healing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scars singing) signaled early, escalates via ritual density under Accumulative lens; one tightening at graft forecloses destruction path, with visible cost in "willing the living tissue to accept what had been broken."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grafting wounds emerges organically from particulars (smoke tree scars, father's hands); final image resonant reconfiguration reweights premise without moralizing, inviting complexity of unresolved healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (nature as watershed, herds of clouds) with rhythmic modulation under ritual pressure; stable close-3rd POV biases details to firefighter's tuned alertness, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., short punchy grafts vs. flowing cloud herds); zero loops, purposeful figurative weave enhances without muddling peak ritual clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson legacy via fire-survivor grafts at obsidian wound-site transforms tropes; bold ritual frame inevitable in hindsight, risk heightens stakes through irreplaceable volcanic/healing logic.</comment>
