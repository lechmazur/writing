<question>1</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Tal's meekness contradicts his bold barter ("I need a reason to keep this forge lit"), earning the final shrug as Earned Stasis with visible cost in sustained patience. Interiority concrete via embodied realizations like feeling the ground hum. Minor slip: emotions told more than layered contradictorily under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descriptive density builds to mine awakening CR, reweighting overlooked potential with cost of deliberate labor. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (forge under arches, Pomona-VII). Closure image of ringing defiance pays off causal barter chain cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Floating arches and dangling roots constrain via mine access and charge final "arches floated overhead... heartbeat returning." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Tal notices rubble potential). No generic placeholders; details evolve with awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (forge sustainability) signaled early, tightens via large awakening barter that surprises Dienne, narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Agency in Tal's counteroffer forces trade-off; cost legible in descent effort. Escalation subtle but coherent to Charged Poise close.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilient recovery emerges via particular images (rubble to ore, Tal/planet parallel), final ring answering without moralizing. Silk subtext layers emotional resonance. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (Tal filters world through salvage). Dialogue subtext-heavy via silk colors and terse exchanges; rhythm modulates from deliberate to humming intensity. Distinct diction reflects quiet defiance.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent (rain shapes stone, tectonic melody). No loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in awakening beat. Minor: occasional elevated diction in low-stress opens, but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of meek artisan awakening geological memory amid floating orchards transforms tropes organically. Risk in large-scale barter pays off in defiance CR. No derivative echoes; premise implications fully committed.</comment>
