<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in lifelong texture-to-sound mapping; contradictory impulses peak when closing fingers around diamond before speaking. Final choice earned via copper-vein hum and bird glyph confirmation, with felt cost of language's death. No flaws touch closure; embodies genuine struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from sensory setup to canyon-wide resonance at "The diamond went clear." On-page CR closure with undeniable conceptual cost (language sealed in echoes despite dying throats). Orientation anchored vividly by para 2; single scene flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Bone towers, copper veins, and canyon echoes constrain platform-edge poise and amplify climax word, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (texture primacy) reflects storyteller bias; details tactile and purposeful, mirroring internal stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice diamond's flaw to save language) signaled early, texturally escalates via bird glyph tightening to speaking act with narrowing options. Agency in precise syllable forecloses silence path; cost legible in exhaled realization amid dying language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of texture-to-sound endurance emerges from particulars like fractured light and canyon chorus; final image reweights dying language premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity (echoes remember). No moralizing; counter-readings (curse as hunger) add depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (granular textures, ancient syllables) stable in single close-third POV; rhythm modulates to quiet intensity at "She spoke it slowly, quietly articulate." Compression taught early, pays off in canyon amplification without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies propulsively, metaphors coherent (light scattering as "brightness interrupted"). Peak beat clarity pristine at diamond's luminous shift; no overwriting dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of copper-vein rituals, bird glyphs, and shattered-light syllable transforms language-death trope; bold world logic (echo-trap canyon) inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
