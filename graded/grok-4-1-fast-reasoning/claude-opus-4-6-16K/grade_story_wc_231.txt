<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eccentric keeper's motivation to decode gesture intensifies through concrete interiority ("borrowed memories" arrives with fog-like certainty) and micro-choices (opening salt-swollen logbook), earning stasis in pinning the flower with isolation's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via pocket details to logbook sketch tightening stake, yielding Charged Poise/CR closure as Maren refuses to drop the flower ("She did not drop it"), with legible cost in "witnessed isolation" reconfiguring her purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist constrain final stance (erased boundary mirrors refusal to release), charging closure image; sensory details (slick iridescence, indigo-black water) selectively bias through Maren's gap-observing lens without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) deepens accumulatively via logbook tying man to her collections, narrowing to endurance choice; agency in observing gaps forecloses release path with on-page cost of perpetual keeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Borrowed memories theme emerges organically from particulars (salvaged objects, logbook sketch), reweighted in final refusal offering non-literal answer to completion of lost gestures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (sea's honest spaces between sounds, gaps method); rhythmic control heightens pressure (short sentences in trembling hands beat), no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (each line layers image/insight); rhythm varies propulsively ("the book had been waiting... to exhale"), with purposeful figurative poise charging closure image untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse isolation trope via "borrowed memories" frame transforms salvaged fragments into inevitable keeper's stasis; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
