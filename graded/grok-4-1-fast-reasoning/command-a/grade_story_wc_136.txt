<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in "analytical side parsing the clues while her artistic side marveled at the surreal beauty," with contradictory impulses in hesitation before punching; earned change at punch forecloses mapped safety with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from punch mystery to mirrors' truths and punch RR closure; cost legible in "leaving behind the safety of her meticulously mapped routes for a path she could not predict."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mirrors constrain by forcing past confrontation, charging closure; mist and starlit vault selectively guide arrows and path, with POV-filtered sensory hierarchy matching mapper's eye for routes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling punch mystery tightens accumulatively through path formation and fortress test; agency in punching crystallizes stance with visible opportunity cost at hesitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of courage over precision emerges organically from maps to internal truths, but final lines "greatest maps... with courage and curiosity" articulate thesis overtly, reducing resonance via echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in route-noticing bias; rhythmic control modulates from precise ("pouring over old railway records") to charged poise at punch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor motif loop in "waiting for her all along" (twice) slightly dulls propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Punch-to-fortress synthesis transforms mystery trope via internal mirrors test, with risk-taking in surreal earth-arrows heightening stakes organically.</comment>
