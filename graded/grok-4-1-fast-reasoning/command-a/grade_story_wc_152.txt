<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choices (dagger reach, swift embroidery) reveal values under pressure; resolve hardens via flame-chart sync. Internal conflict surfaces in hesitation but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Lira applies targeted pressure without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pulsing flame and shifting constellations to chart completion as CR, reweighting conspiracy with purpose found. Lira's arrival causal beat tightens stakes; orientation anchors early in observatory setup. Final image ("one stitch at a time") makes before/after legible with cosmic cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Observatory as nexus constrains choices (peering through stained-glass, embroidery station); flame pulses integrate with action, mirroring internal urgency. Autumn wind contrasts sanctuary's echoed silence, evolving to hum at climax. Recurring chart charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect flame/gateway) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via revelation and sync narrowing to cosmic action. Agency in joint weaving forecloses doubt with felt threat (mentor silenced). Escalation coheres under lens, cost legible in purpose amid vast conspiracy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic truth vs. disguised conspiracy emerges via shifting patterns and sync; final chart offers non-literal answer ("stories of the stars" counter vast plot). Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing. Earned via struggle without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (stars' silent tales, thread urgency); dialogue goal-driven (Lira's "synchronize" persuades). Rhythm modulates from calm to pulsing intensity. No head-hopping; voice distinct in characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid integration (flame "pulsed in time with her heartbeat"); minor slips in "echoed silence" repetition and shifting synonym. Propulsion strong to final image; no loops dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embroiderer mapping stars transforms conspiracy into cosmic weave; "adjacent possibilities" freshens mysticism. Synthesis of art-truth pursuit feels organic, risking bold gateway premise without gimmick.</comment>
