<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's resolute scavenging and chronologically confused mind drive concrete micro-choices like prying the wheel and following its hum, earning the pivot from haunted regret to sparked hope; embodied emotions (trembling hands, breath caught) layer contradictions without therapy-speak. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in collection vs. weight of regret. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("spark of hope") at nightfall slightly softens cost legibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density builds from wheel's faint voice to clearer message, cadence shift reconfigures ghost as guide in final image with felt cost of prior regret. Continuous scene (lagoon edge walk) with one tightening (collected objects sync thoughts). Orientation anchored early; closure Charged Poise legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon's shimmering currents, sinking mud, and thinning clouds constrain choices (following edge, kneeling) and mirror fractured internal state, evolving to stirred currents charging final step. Sensory mix (visual gleam, tactile mud, auditory hum/static) purposeful via POV bias. Recurring wheel as micro-setting charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate ghost via fragments) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through wheel's guiding hum, collected items, and deepening voice clarity narrowing regret options. Agency in prizing wheel and walking forces trade-off (carry weight vs. rebuild); cost felt in "regret clung like second skin" persisting to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges organically via collection beats and final reweighting (ghost as guide, not enemy), resonant non-literal answer in "fractured stillness... a beginning" recharging prior material without moralizing. Subtext in pulsing wheel implies eroded ambitions' persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (chronologically confused filtering via "days or years?"); lyrical rhythm modulates from static whispers to stirred currents under pressure. Diction biased (trinkets "speak"), no head-hopping or withholding; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences weave action/image (e.g., "boots sinking... followed the lagoon’s edge"). "Fractured stillness" and "hum" recur purposefully without loops; minor paraphrase in regret descriptions ("weight she carried," "clung like second skin") nudges down, but no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scavenger trope via voice-emitting camera wheel in kinetic lagoon transforms eroded ambitions into guiding ghost; risk-taking in surreal setting/texture heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from early hum to final spark.</comment>
