<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove "empty spaces remember" compels the leap via cloud-emotion lens; embodied tension in "heart pounding" and railing step reveals contradiction between safety and theory. Telescope handling shows passion without stock epiphanies. Minor abstractness in emotions doesn't touch closure change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cloud observations build density to glowing cumulus approach ("closer now"), climaxing in leap-return CR with cost in surreal embrace and lingering light. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Telescope and gondola railing constrain choices, charging final "gleaming softly" image; cloud details ("spiral...question mark") filter through POV bias, mirroring internal states purposefully. Sensory narrowing under crisis (colder air, creaking) vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove theory) signaled early, escalates via cumulus pull forcing leap agency under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "precarious" balance and weightless immersion foreclosing safe descent. One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sky as memory repository emerges via cloud visions ("fragments of lives"); final "afterimage burned" offers non-literal CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in surreal proof avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with distinct perceptual signature (clouds as "rage," "nostalgia"); rhythmic modulation peaks in leap ("world slowed"). No elision or head-hopping; diction fits poetic meteorologist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in leap sequence ("weightless, suspended"); varied syntax/paragraphs, no loops or muddled metaphors despite figurative clouds. Minor "glowing" repetition purposeful, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cloud-emotion premise and leap-vision synthesize fresh "sky memorial" angle; surreal return transforms stranding trope organically. Risky mysticism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
