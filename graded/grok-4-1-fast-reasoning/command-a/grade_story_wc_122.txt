<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority via felt vibrations and gradual emotional surfacing; contradictory impulses in skepticism vs. desperation motivate the process; final tear as earned change with embodied cost, but epiphany edges tidy without peak ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: work on backward songs builds density to sensory awakening; CR closure in tear and realization reconfigures hush with emotional cost; orientation anchored early, no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cavern vibrations constrain her felt music and charge final drum tap; selective sensory details (torches, stone echoes) mirror internal hush via POV; drum as micro-setting evolves to enable closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via subtle changes to tear; agency in painstaking reversal process forecloses numbness path; cost legible in raw aliveness, but lacks sharp trade-off tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing hush emerges via particulars like vibrations and reversed songs; final image reweights silence as possibility without moralizing; resonance from deaf POV avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with vibration-biased perception; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to aliveness; diction poetic yet consistent, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but "faint rustle of turning seasons" loops twice without payoff; figurative heaviness (e.g., "filament of hush") risks overwriting in process beats; rhythm varies well at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf drummer + backward songs transforms numbness trope; backward method risks bold ingenuity, charging CR closure organically.</comment>
