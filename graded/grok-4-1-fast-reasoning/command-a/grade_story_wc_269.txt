<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in concrete habits like pen-tapping and page-handling, rooting motivation in coral witness background and path obsession. Realization at "Some paths disappear... we never fully understood" feels earned via prior curiosity. Slip: minimal contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure limit elite tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from page cue to evening assembly, culminating in CR closure ("The page had been torn out not to hide...") with conceptual cost of ignored truths. Orientation anchored early at station. Single scene with natural ellipses; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station and sea vividly constrain reflection, with alarm chime pulling from thoughts and metal floor enabling tapping. Atlas page as recurring micro-setting charges final image. Sensory filter (pale sun, frayed edges) POV-specific; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel page/paths) signaled early, tightens via evening assembly into revelation that forecloses ignorance with conceptual cost. Agency in persistent curiosity/endurance. Accumulative pressure coheres but lacks visceral trade-off narrowing live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing paths emerges organically from page, reefs, fossil sites; final line ("we stop walking them") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in deliberate tear enriches complexity. Particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (rhythmic noticing, ocean rhythms). Prose texture modulates from calm gaze to charged drumming; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice particular via biologist's environmental lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; sentences propel via image-action integration. Minor repetition in "tapping rhythms" (three mentions) creates subtle pattern without loop drag. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-reflection, torn atlas as truth-preserver, post-ban fragility; transforms climate tropes via personal puzzle. Page realization feels inevitable from particulars. Risks quiet CR payoff effectively.</comment>
