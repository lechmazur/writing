<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in curiosity intensifies credibly to compel following the fossil; interiority embodied in "heart racing" and fossil's warmth. Minor slip in tidy epiphany "she understood then" abstracts struggle without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional patterns build density to chamber CR (realization reweights her role with purpose cost). Fossil floats provide one meaningful tightening; orientation anchored early in cave work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt, damp earth, bioluminescent algae) selective via POV bias, constrain path to "deepest part"; fossil as micro-setting charges closure image on pedestal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering emotional history) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fossil's emotional surge narrowing to chamber pursuit with agency (following, placing it). Cost felt in deepened purpose; one pressure point suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of emotions bridging worlds emerges organically from mapping and fossil; final chamber image offers resonant CR without moralizing. Minor thematic echo in "voice of the unknown" summary slightly abstracts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sensory mapping; rhythmic prose modulates from precise ("tracing contours") to lyrical in revelation. No dialogue; diction controlled and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops; sentences propel via image integration (fossil "hum faintly"). Minor overwriting in repeated "as if" constructions doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping and emotional fossils transforms discovery trope; fossil's pulse and float feel inevitable from "factually mystical" grounding, risking quiet mysticism payoff.</comment>
