<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in curiosity drives consistent tinkering to breakthrough, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; embodied emotions surface at climax ("heart raced... fingers trembling") yet feel stock elsewhere, limiting depth for single-POV baseline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density buildup from tinkering to holographic bell; on-page closure via ringing (world responds, echo remains) delivers Charged Poise CR with felt cost in "journey far from over"; orientation anchored early in workshop-sea setup, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Acid sea and workshop details (churning waves, fogged windows, rattling panes) vividly constrain tinkering and charge final image (sea stills, then churns); sensory integration purposeful through POV urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock yearning algorithm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via image patterns to decisive breakthrough; agency in feeding data/kaleidoscope yields tightening with on-page cost (calloused hands, bloodshot eyes) foreclosing aimless tinkering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken human longing emerges organically from algorithm quest and bell's resonant hum/world response; final grin amid chaos offers non-literal answer reweighting creation's absurdity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (tinkering bias: gears, holograms, sea patterns); rhythmic prose modulates intensity ("machine whirred faster... held its breath"), no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density in breakthrough ("holographic bell materialized... iridescent hue") propels without loops; minor paraphrase in workshop descriptors ("clanking metal and whirring parts... mechanical hum") dulls slightly, but rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk invention (yearning algorithm via kaleidoscope) and acid-sea evolution transforms tropes; irreverent bell-ringing payoff feels inevitable from particulars, risking conceptual boldness without gimmick.</comment>
