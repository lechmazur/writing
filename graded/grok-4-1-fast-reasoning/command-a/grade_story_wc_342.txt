<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and fractal perception embodied well in tracing bark and trembling hands during crafting; face-blind trait and portrait role stated early but fail to constrain or complicate any on-page choice, diluting motivation depth at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from coin clues to book safe decoding; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final shudder clutching book, reweighting stillness with cost of collapse, though orientation anchors early without disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hollow trunk shelves and groaning building constrain crafting choice amid decay; fractal veins/cracks and coin metal tactilely filter through Elara's bias, charging final image as world shifts post-completion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mirroring sky tests limits with situational tightening via building shudder forcing clutch/escape; agency in decoding/crafting drives one deepening, cost felt in violent collapse narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of infinite-in-finite emerges organically from coin-to-constellations crafting; final image resonant reconfiguration answers premise without moralizing, though ambiguity lingers strongly in "boundless possibility."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct fractal perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation builds lyric density to charged poise, elisions purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm in crafting beat; minor paraphrase loop in "stillness" motifs ("hush," "silence," "stillness") slightly dulls propulsion before collapse, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face-blind artist decoding sky via tree-library coin synthesizes fresh premise; risk in fractal precision amid demolition heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
