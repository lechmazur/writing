<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior conflict—compass trust vs pole adaptation—shows contradictory impulses acting in scene; embodied emotions via tracing compass and wobbling legs ground her; final endurance earned by prior micro-choices like carrying scarred kayak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: texture of compass failure, poles, waves builds density to Charged Poise closure (tucks compass, paddles with hope); cost legible in "backlash of regrets still lingered, but it no longer defined her"; single scene anchored early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poles and scarred kayak constrain adaptation choices, charging final image as they fade; sensory details (salt, seaweed, splashes) selective via POV urgency; dawn sky mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome regrets via adaptation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as poles replace compass, narrowing to endurance; agency in deliberate strokes forecloses old reliance with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation beyond failure emerges from compass-to-poles shift and final paddling image reweighting regrets; resonant non-literal answer in "merrily melancholic smile" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (melancholic kinship to poles); rhythmic prose modulates from static reflection to meditative strokes; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("backlash of regrets" twice, "merrily melancholic" echoed) dull density slightly; strong propulsion overall, varied rhythm, but minor scaffold in repetitive stems impacts momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of utility poles as navigation lifeline transforms redemption trope; risk in melancholic adaptation feels organic and inevitable to character flaws.</comment>
