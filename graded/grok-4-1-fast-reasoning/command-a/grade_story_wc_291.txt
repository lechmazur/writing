<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Face-blindness concretely shields her during the figure encounter, focusing on silhouette and intent over features, rooting her methodical traits in contradictory impulses. Interiority particular via art's emotional landscapes; micro-choices like gripping the tool align with endurance under pressure. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing like "confronting the very nature of empathy" edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ribbon tracing to figure's glinting match, culminating in on-page CR via portrait that reconfigures empathy's chasm with felt deepening obsession as cost ("motivation deepened"). Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 1; one tightening via encounter narrows investigative options. No orientation debt; closure legible with undeniable conceptual cost in mist parting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and jagged stone constrain visibility and choices during figure encounter, charging final image as shadows retreat post-portrait. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (breath visible, boots crunching) integrates via goal-directed action; quarry evolves causally (mist clings → parts). Mirrors internal chasm without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging case via empathy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in figure's ribbon taunt that reweights clue/warning, forcing sketch as endurance with visible heart-tremor cost. Protagonist agency in calling out and tool-grip; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in portrait's unification. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges organically from face-blindness, quarry chasm, and ribbon merge, reweighted non-literally in portrait piercing darkness. Subtext in figure's silent hand vs. her steady voice builds ambiguity; invites reflection via art's bridge. Weakness: near-thematic echo in "even in the coldest cases, empathy could be awakened" borders statement over image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature via voids/silhouettes; diction selective (e.g., "frayed edge" tactile). Rhythm modulates with intensity (short sentences in encounter: "The figure paused..."). No dialogue beyond one natural line; free indirect clean, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "boots crunching on gravel" advances sound, space, tension); varied rhythm, strong verbs. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("clockwork mechanism... emotional landscapes") in opening reflective beat dulls slightly, but closure image crisp without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms cold case trope via face-blind artist's paradox, synthesizing with quarry metaphor and silent figure for fresh CR on empathy. Bold risk in quiet sketch-closure heightens stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable synthesis feels inevitable in ribbon merge → portrait.</comment>
