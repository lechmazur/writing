<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in legacy drives descent and rejection of hush, with embodied tension in "heart pounded" and clutched lattice; earned renunciation at journal close forecloses silence path with felt inheritance cost. Minor tidy epiphany in "realized it wasn’t what he wanted" slightly undercuts contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (journal revelation) deepen knowledge toward CR closure in final defiance image; orientation anchored early in lighthouse/Elias setup; legible tightening at chamber pedestal narrows options from hush to truth with legacy cost felt in "weight of his inheritance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (colder air resisting descent, copperlight veins) filters through Elias's priorities; lattice and door scuffs constrain micro-choices (grounds descent, glimpses light); final reef gaze charges CR image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem name before bodies found) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via journal (guards as offerings) forcing renunciation; agency in ascent/choice forecloses hush with on-page cost of legacy break; pressure coheres to charged poise in final hover.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth over inherited silence emerges organically from journal realization and final image reconfiguration; resonant non-literal answer in "no longer the son... boy who chased truth" reweights wolf legacy without moralizing; particulars like lattice avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in lattice grounding and biased noticing (family echoes); rhythmic texture modulates tension (short creak sentences in descent); no dialogue, but voice specificity shines in "thread this labyrinth with his own story."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying paragraph lengths; minor overwriting in repeated "hush" motifs borders purple without muddling closure; clean syntax propels to dawn image, no loops or scaffolds dulling key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wolf legacy in lighthouse labyrinth transforms trope via lattice impossibilities and hush rejection; risk in abstract "hover" bookends heightens defiance stakes organically; no derivative templates, feels inevitable in truth arc.</comment>
