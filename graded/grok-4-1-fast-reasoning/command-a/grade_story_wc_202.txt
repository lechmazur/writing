<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, rooted in childhood lighthouse promise; actions align via intuition-led choices. Interiority concrete in tactile moments like fingers tightening on fragment, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning declarative. Childhood block anchors present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from market discovery to tower murals, tightening via map find. Orientation anchored early (~50 words). Closure as CR in final image—fragment glow fades, stories reclaimed—with felt conceptual cost of histories' weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (copper/sage hum, wind-tugged cloak) reflects POV urgency, market platforms constrain painting discovery. Recurring spires/lens charge final dawn image. Integrated via goal-directed movement, no white-room; micro-setting (ivy doorway) enables payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim histories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via symbol-map-tower progression narrowing to murals. Agency in unfastening/deciphering forecloses forgotten path with felt weight. Cost legible in fragment pulse and shadow-ghosts, but abstract vs. visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of intuition anchoring overlooked emerges organically from fragment/paintings/murals, final image reconfigures (whole in mind) without moralizing. Subtext in elusively tangible gaps invites ambiguity. Resonance from particulars like spiral symbol shifting meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (world-gaps, intuition whispers); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates to brighter light at climax. No head-hopping or withholding; voice biases toward forgotten lore. Compression purposeful, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm/syntax; vivid verbs (brushing, unfastening). Minor loops in "elusively tangible"/"eternal instant" phrasing (-0.3), but pattern-taught as motif. No heavy artifacts dulling closure; metaphors coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: translator in airborne alchemist market decoding painted secrets transforms relic-hunt trope. Bold lyric risk ( Accumulative lens) heightens intuition stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise follows implications to CR.</comment>
