<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and earned internal shift from withdrawn clutching of program to standing taller as storyteller; minor slip in simultaneous contradictory impulses, with acceptance mostly revelatory rather than conflicted in pivotal tracing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from vine pulses to swirling patterns and ink absorption; on-page Conceptual Repricing closure ("armor feeling less like a burden and more like a shell") reconfigures withdrawn stance with felt cost of shedding past self; orientation anchored early in greenhouse scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vines as recurring micro-setting constrain pivotal tracing choice and charge final waving image; sensory details (nightshade scent, bioluminescent shifts) selectively mirror internal possibility without overt symbolism; 9+ test passed via environmental constraint on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (allegiance to possibility) signaled early and tightens texturally via blurring reality and puppet vision; agency in unsnapping/tracing forecloses withdrawn path with visible cost (gauntlet clang, program vanishing); cost unmistakable in reconfiguration of self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of stories shaping reality emerges organically from program-to-vines progression without statement; final stringless marionette image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting endless night premise; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "stories yet to be told."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns as "instructions, forgotten patterns"); rhythmic modulation builds to shivering bliss under pressure; no dialogue, purposeful poetic compression taught early via vine patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "vines pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat" advances atmosphere/action); minor figurative density in peak swirling beat risks overwrite but coheres without muddle; varied rhythm, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knight-as-puppet in alchemical greenhouse transforms tropes via program-ink tattoo and vine instructions; risk-taking in factually mystical patterns heightens stakes organically; non-obvious allegiance to possibility feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
