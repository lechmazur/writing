<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to act on doubt about Thomas is clear and intensifies through anchored reflection on the prisoner's story, culminating in earned resolve. Interiority concrete via wandering the shop and brushing boxes, revealing contradictory duty and guilt. Alistair applies relevant pressure via cryptic wisdom, forcing micro-choice to follow into workshop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of shop details and Alistair's words build to Charged Poise closure where Elias cradles repaired heart, ready for "the storm," with legible emotional cost of impending action. Single scene oriented early (shop, heart by para 2); one tightening via repair success reconfigures doubt. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective (scent of "aged wood and oil," shelves of silent boxes) constrains choices—Elias wanders, Alistair works in workshop—and charges final image as "vibrant hush lingers." Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward broken mechanisms mirroring internal states. Micro-setting (music boxes) evolves with action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve doubt via heart repair/apology action) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through Alistair's "mending... understanding why" and ticking heart, forcing stance crystallization with cost of "weight... on his shoulders." Agency in following to workshop and leaving ready; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mending revealing truth emerges organically from heart repair paralleling Thomas's case, reweighted in final image of ticking heart and storm ahead without moralizing. Subtext in Alistair's proverbs and floral box (beauty in cracks) invites ambiguity on redemption. Protagonist arc inextricable from "apology into action."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature in reflective noticing of broken boxes as "stories frozen." Dialogue natural/subtextual (Alistair's "not just the mechanism"); voice textured, rhythmic modulation in short resolve sentences. Minor elevated diction ("vibrant hush") consistent but not peak-distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punchy realizations amid descriptive paragraphs); density high, sentences multi-job (e.g., "vibrant hush... cradle every movement" advances atmosphere/action). Minor scaffold in "thought of Thomas again" paraphrase near floral box (−0.4); no loops or muddled figs in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Core premise (clockwork heart as literal/metaphoric doubt-mender in music box shop) fresh synthesis, transforming redemption tropes via tactile repair. Risky poetic conceit ("light breaks through storm clouds") heightens stakes organically. Turns earned from shop particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
