<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in contradictory past destruction and redemption, embodied in trembling hands at egg placement; internal conflict acts via haunted memories tilting present choice. Minor label-speak like "secretly sentimental" dilutes without full embodiment, but doesn't touch closure. Final act earns change with felt cost of undeserved grace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via cracks-map to damp earth discovery; orientation anchored early in salt flat. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in egg burial and rain onset reconfigures redemption with conceptual cost ("work far from over") legible in final image. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains via shifting surface and cracks guiding to damp miracle; sensory vivid (shimmered/cracked mirror, crystalline prints) mirrors internal fracture. Weather (distant thunder to rain) evolves causally, charging final image. Recurring salt/earth charges closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve bird echo) signaled early, tightens texturally via crack-following to release; agency in meticulous navigation forecloses failure path. Past guilt interweaves internal pressure; cost felt in risked everything and trembling at climax. One meaningful deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fractured redemption emerges organically from drought-guilt to egg release; final rain image offers non-literal answer reweighting destruction with grace. Subtext in "echo" motif shifts from loss to potential without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in environmental bias (cracks as "natural blueprint"); rhythmic prose modulates from purposeful stride to still pause at closure. No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled, poetic without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "fissures...traced paths of water long gone"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening ("cracked mirror") purposeful; closure image propels cleanly without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drought culpability and crack-map navigation transforms eco-guilt trope; egg as genetic relic in salt flat feels inevitable. Risk in sentimental amoralist arc heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
