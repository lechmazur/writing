<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's nurturing motivation drives consistent micro-choices like humming and hand-linking, earning Finn's shift with embodied calm; Finn's fear-to-wonder arc shows contradiction in his trembling voice yielding to curiosity. Minor slip in overt epiphany lines like “Magic isn’t just about what’s extraordinary,” but does not touch closure. Internal traits particular without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via meadow whispers and eclipse darkening, holds to Charged Poise closure in eyes-closed moment reconfiguring Finn's wonder with felt emotional cost (telescope forgotten). Single continuous scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph (Sage Ridge, eclipse). One tightening via curl's glow mirroring corona narrows to shared magic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details selective (glowing grass, dimmed light, hush) filter through Elara's perceptual bias, constrain choices (clearing draws her, eclipse times hum). Eclipse corona charges final image with Finn's face alight; recurring roots/meadows evolve with post-eclipse hum. Spatial choreography clear in kneeling, hand-hold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture Finn's wonder) signaled early via pouch tether, tightens accumulatively as eclipse deepens fear, forces hand-link agency foreclosing isolation with cost (Finn's dormant spark ignited, eclipsing telescope). Pressure coheres texturally without reversal need; visible price in shared vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ordinary magic theme emerges organically from curl's glow and hum weaving into eclipse, reweighted in final image of curl as shared symbol without moralizing. Subtext in Finn's “sky is broken” contrasts Elara's reframing; ambiguity lingers in “the moment. And you.” Protagonist arc inextricable from theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elara's perceptual signature (music as bridge, light absorption); dialogue natural/subtextual (“It’s like the sky is broken” pursues fear, Elara evades with lullaby calm). Rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate steps to hushed stillness; no head-hopping, voice distinct between characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (long meadow sentences to short eclipse breaths); high density integrates sensory/prose jobs, but minor paraphrase loops in “softly adaptive” and “hush” echoes dull two mid-beats (−0.4). No closure artifacts; strong verbs, vivid specifics replace generics. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse as ordinary magic via therapist's curl/hum transforms mentor-kid trope; curl's glow-to-symbol arc feels inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk in textural build heightens quiet stakes without gimmick; no derivative templates.</comment>
