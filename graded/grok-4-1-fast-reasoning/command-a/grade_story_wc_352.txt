<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving all choices to the seed acquisition with felt responsibility as cost; however, prism-minded trait is labeled rather than shown through contradictory impulses or specific micro-choices under pressure, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkage from pool entry to inversion to doodle-guided unlock (DC closure via compartment opening); legible cost in "journey far from over" and seed's responsibility reconfigures options; orientation anchored early in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (mist scent, cold water, glowing veins) selectively build urgency and mirror internal blaze, constraining navigation during inversion; grotto evolves causally with luminescence guiding choices to pedestal climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock combinations for vigilance seeds) signaled early, tightens via inversion reversal narrowing paths and knowledge; agency in aligning doodle forecloses pre-inversion access with on-page cost of falling return and new burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-protection emerges organically from quest particulars and seed's promise, reweighted in final image without moralizing; lacks competing counter-reading for deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward patterns/knowledge; rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory buildup to climax intensity; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion in inversion beat with varied syntax, but minor paraphrase loops ("luminescent veins... glow brighter"; "heart alight with a latent blaze" echoes opening) and occasional stacked modifiers dull peak density slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival quest with gravity inversion threshold transforms standard fantasy retrieval; risk in fantastical physics pays off at legible closure without gimmickry.</comment>
