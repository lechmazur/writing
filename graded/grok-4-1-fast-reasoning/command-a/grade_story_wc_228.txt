<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but leans on poetic summaries over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; micro-choices like cradling seashell reveal values mildly, but painting decision lacks embodied struggle or visible cost in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from detour to oasis realization; on-page CR closure via painting and lighter heart reconfigures aloofness with felt cost of rejoining world, oriented clearly early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pool and stalactites as micro-setting constrain painting choice and charge inverted-world image central to eternity concept; sensory details selective through painter's biased eye, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stake of timeless promise deepens accumulatively via wrong turn to painting decision, foreclosing isolation path; cost legible in trembling hands and rejoining world, but pressure remains internal/abstract without sharper agency test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of impermanent eternity emerges organically from seashell to oasis painting; final quay display offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting personal promise as shared tapestry, with lingering ambiguity on aloofness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with painterly perceptual signature in light/shadow motifs; voice modulates rhythmically from introspective to resolved, diction purposeful without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in promise reflection ("timeless... outlast... eternal") and repetitive "temporary eternity" slightly dull density in deepening beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh inflection via painter's wrong turn synthesizing nostalgia and cave discovery into charged art act; transforms aloof artist trope through specific eternity concept without hedging.</comment>
