<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to reflect light shown through tending plants and descent, but told via "wistfully pragmatic" label; tooth exchange earns relational change with embodied touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density tightening to charged poise closure; cost legible in "piece of me" as vulnerability exposed on dock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonlight and harbor constrain descent from fire escape and charge tooth reveal in lantern glow, filtering through Elara's perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Textural escalation via motif accumulation (hush, oars, light) narrows isolation to connection; agency in handing tooth forecloses solitude with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Light-into-shadows theme emerges organically from plant-tending to lantern/tooth union; final hush reconfigures premise via shared image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature on rhythms/light; dialogue subtextual, goal-driven in exchange ("You've found a piece of me").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Patterned motif echoes (hush, oars) purposeful without loops dulling propulsion; minor atmospheric paraphrase ("world held its breath") doesn't obscure dock closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Gardener-lockmaster synthesis via matching tooth/lantern transforms chance encounter into inevitable resonance, risking quiet lyric closure.</comment>
