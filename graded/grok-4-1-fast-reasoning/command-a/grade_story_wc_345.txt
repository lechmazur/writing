<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivations clear and consistent for Elara and Kael, but interiority surface-level with no contradictory impulses shown during group efforts; summary of allies' discoveries ("Mira discovered... Jorin remembered") skips micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building discoveries to RR closure at "nebula... returned... Elara... faded"; orientation anchored early in orchard/planet; one tightening via bell restoration suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "scent of blooming fruit trees" and "floating rock arches casting long shadows" constrain path and echo bell sound, charging final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore nebula via bell) signaled early, escalates texturally through discoveries to ringing; cost legible in Elara's fade and implied effort, but summary flattens one reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective restoration emerges organically from events/motifs without statement; final "hope no longer brambled but blooming" offers resonant reweighting of strangers-to-family arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fable-like third-person voice stable with perceptual signature in nature-tinged diction; no dialogue to judge; omniscient distance consistent, modulating rhythmically to climax without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but figurative density ("vines... bramble... blossom") borders overwrite in opening and paraphrase loop in progress summary ("discovered... remembered... seemed to stir"); closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-orchestrated planetary restoration transforms tropes via chalk messages and collective; "floating rock arches" and nebula reprise feel organic and risk-taking.</comment>
