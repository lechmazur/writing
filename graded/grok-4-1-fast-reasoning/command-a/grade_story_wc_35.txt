<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to smooth memories roots consistently in her gift, compelling higher-stakes touches like the jagged etching of the father's regret, where remorse threatens to overwhelm but her resolve endures with embodied tears at the shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from tidal pools to pavilion corridors to central shard; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page when shard dissolves after her subsuming, with legible emotional cost in her tears and lighter heart; orientation anchored early in desert fortress.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coral walls frosted with ice and etched memories constrain choices by transmitting remorse through touch, charging the final shard image; sensory details like damp sand scent and colder air evolve purposefully, mirroring her internal smoothing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of smoothing stored remorse tightens accumulatively through wall etchings to own buried regrets at the pedestal, forcing endurance with visible cost in tears; agency in pressing palms and touching shard narrows options under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transforming raw remorse into bearable lessons emerges organically from tasting and smoothing memories, reweighted in final dawn image where pavilion melts, her heart lighter without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tasting memories as flavors; voice texture modulates poetically from heightened senses post-rain to steady resolve, consistent diction without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in "stored remorse" and "memory" phrasing dull density mid-pavilion; overwriting in stacked metaphors like "sandpaper rough memories" clashes slightly, but rhythm propels to clean closure image; no filter stacks or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef in remorse-crystallized coral pavilion transforms tropes through specific submersion mechanics; risk in solo emotional contagion heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at shard dissolution.</comment>
