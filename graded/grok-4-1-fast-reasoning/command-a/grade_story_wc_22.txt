<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to reclaim battlefield clear and consistent, embodied in kneeling/planting with creaking knees; interiority concrete via drifting mind to dead languages and imagined garden. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—reflection dominates without on-page micro-choices under pressure. Final spark of possibility feels earned but summarizes endurance without pivotal cost moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from planting to deepening twilight, imagined growth, and carriage departure; orientation anchored early (coachman at blooming jetty). Closure as Charged Poise/CR in final image—stars' benediction reconfigures desolation to blooming vastness with felt cost of years' weight. Single scene with no shards fits defaults; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (salt/decay scent, bird calls, graying wood/wildflowers) filters through coachman's ancient gaze, constraining planting choices on jetty. Jetty as micro-setting evolves (flowers taller) and charges final survey. POV bias shapes selective details like narrow horizon mirroring theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclaiming battlefield) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bird-guided placement and imagined canopy fading war scars. One deepening as pulse of life felt in soil forces stance crystallization. Stakes mostly internal/poetic with visible cost (creaking knees, heavy heart), but lacks live opposition narrowing options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from loss emerges organically via jetty's transformation and seed crumbling to potential, resisting tidy morals. Final image (stars whispering approval, garden spreading) offers resonant non-literal answer to narrow vastness blooming. Minor friction: last paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing ("not the size... that mattered").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (ancient whispers, bird maps); rhythmic prose modulates from whisper to creaking resolve. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens. Voice reflects coachman's timeless poise without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with twilight deepening, but paraphrase loops ("blooming jetty," "narrow vastness" repeated without new pressure) and synonym churn (whispers/hope multiple times) drag density in reflective blocks. Figurative density high but coherent (shadows dancing like ghosts); no closure artifacts. Paragraphs purposeful, advancing texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-reef coachman weaving dead languages/bird calls into reclamation transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via persistent narrow vastness motif charging closure. No derivative echoes; voice/setting cohere as singular vision.</comment>
