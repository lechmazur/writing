<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Characters consistent and motivated by clear pursuit of presence, with relationship as crucible in shared secret moment forcing deepened bond; however, lacks embodied contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices, as Elara's process unfolds smoothly without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via explanation, hum, and glow to Charged Poise closure in "we’ve found a way to carry this with us, forever," reconfiguring presence with felt relational cost; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ember nexus and twilight specifics selectively mirror internal harmony, with nautilus shell as micro-setting constraining the anchoring ritual and charging final richer air image; sensory hierarchy fits alchemist POV, no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing presence signaled early tightens accumulatively through shared secret and ritual deepening, narrowing to transformed moment with legible cost in eternal carry; lacks sharper agency-driven reversal narrowing options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of revaluing presence emerges organically from ritual particulars, with final image resonating non-literally via spiral shell motif reweighting time without moralizing; minor directness in "revalue what we think we know" tempers peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing of harmonies; dialogue natural, subtextual in Kael's softening nod advancing bond; rhythmic diction modulates to chant intensity without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm, but overwriting in stacked metaphors like "fragment of a forgotten star" and "spiral of endless possibility" risks muddle in climax glow beat; no loops, clean propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical science-romance transforms time-capture trope via shell ritual and nexus, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes organically; no derivatives, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
