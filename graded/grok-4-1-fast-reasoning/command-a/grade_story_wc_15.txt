<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Weakness in dramatized internal conflict; contradictory impulses absent, with doubt and fatigue merely told in "moments of doubt and fatigue" rather than embodied in micro-choices during weaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern of overlapping paths building to resonant reconfiguration at "canyon seemed to exhale"; on-page closure legible with felt dedication cost, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strength in selective sensory details like "scent of earth and time" filtered through POV; recurring plate constrains choices and charges final image where walls glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens texturally via increasing overlaps and final threads; agency in sewing endures fatigue, but no reversal or live option foreclosed on-page weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of ruin-to-reverence emerges from particulars like seeping colors; final image of glowing walls offers non-literal resonance reweighting decay without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice consistent with perceptual bias toward beauty in decay; rhythmic modulation suits sleepwalking, stable single POV with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in weaving descriptions ("stitch in the tapestry", "sewed the essence") and repetitive "hauntingly optimistic" create template cadence, dulling propulsion in process beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sleepwalking weaver mending labyrinth via story-plate transforms ruin tropes organically; wharf-dream image adds memorable inflection.</comment>
