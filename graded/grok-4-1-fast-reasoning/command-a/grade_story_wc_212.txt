<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in inheritance traits, intensifying to closure resolve; embodied "heart pounding yet strangely at peace" shows contradiction. Pivotal "In that moment, she understood" epiphany unearned without prior micro-choices under pressure, lacking scene-acting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from atrium decay to vortex step-through CR closure with responsibility cost legible in final "deep sense of purpose." Orientation anchored early; minimal tightening as cap insertion yields easy gateway without narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective "starlight filtered through crystalline spires" and "frozen archway" integrate into action, contrasting final "rolling hills...vivid against the twilight sky" to charge image shift. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward relics; subtle guidance via arch proximity, no pivotal constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover borrowed time via vortex) signaled early with abstract restoration drive; one deepening realization narrows to harmony under Accumulative lens. Minimal agency pressure—no reversal tests commitment, easy reopen lacks trade-off before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance in chaos emerges organically from seed preservation to "nurturing the future"; final bond with creature offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting inheritance. Minor directness in "finding harmony in chaos" borders telling without full complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature ("texture...smooth yet fragile"); rhythmic modulation fits accumulative build, diction purposeful and biased toward energy/relics. No head-hopping or withholding; voice coherent under resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels to closure; high density in vortex "swirling void...living entity." Minor paraphrase loops in realization ("restoring balance...harmony in chaos") dull peak slightly; no heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy reversal and "texture of borrowed time" transforms portal/inheritance tropes via seed saver lens; conceptual integrity bold without gimmick. Final creature bond inflects organically from egg setup.</comment>
