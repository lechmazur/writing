<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Alara's motivation to translate silence via chess intensifies credibly through embodied actions like tracing the worry stone and arranging pieces, earning her resolve; internal conflict between covenant silence and questioning shows in recalled argument, but epiphany at "surge of clarity" feels slightly tidy without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as nexus density builds thoughts into chess shifts and pattern revelation; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with "toppled the king" reconfiguring exile as purpose, cost legible in letting go of past; orientation anchored early in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nexus hum and pulse constrain choices by amplifying thoughts into piece movements; twilight hues and basalt coolness filter through Alara's priorities, charging final resolve; micro-setting of chessboard mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating silence for beauty tightens via autonomous piece movements, especially knight's sacrifice narrowing to forward path; agency in final topple forecloses resentment with felt conceptual cost; pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as bridge emerges organically from chess pattern and covenant recall, resonating in final image of resolve; repeated "beauty in the difficult" borders on direct statement, slightly undercutting subtextual emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in chess/silence focus; voice texture modulates rhythmically from humming tension to quiet resolve; purposeful poetic compression taught early remains legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with lines like "knight advanced, then retreated, then sacrificed" propelling via varied rhythm; minor loops in "thoughtfully precise" phrasing and "beauty in the difficult" deduct lightly, not touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess as silence translation at magnetic nexus transforms exile trope; knight's journey and covenant reweighting feel inevitable from setup, with risk in solo reflective drive heightening stakes.</comment>
