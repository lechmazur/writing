<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clara's honesty as contradictory impulse shines in holding the ink pot despite fear, compelling the confrontation; father's shift from anger to sincerity feels earned through her steady gaze and words. Interiority concrete via embodied tingling and tracing table edge. Final change credible but epiphany borders on unearned rationalization in "fair trade... within herself."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: ink pot density builds energy/texture toward CR closure in hand-holding and pot fading, reweighting escape premise with conceptual cost of breached barriers. Orientation anchored early (prep room, father negotiating). One tightening via pot ripple to dialogue confrontation narrows running options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ink pot as micro-setting constrains choice (clutched despite footsteps) and charges final image (glow fades, set down). Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-biased: formaldehyde/wax smell, cold marble under crisis urgency. "Deathly vitality" mirrors internal rebirth without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honest balance vs. schemes/asylum) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pot's urging to confrontation, forcing renunciation of running with felt relational cost in father's tentative grip. Agency in holding out pot and declaring "we need to stay—honestly" forecloses path. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of internal fair trade emerges organically from pot liquefying barriers and final hand-hold reweighting honesty as strength, non-literal answer to schemes vs. truth without moralizing. Ink pot shifts from eerie comfort to fulfilled purpose. Resonance in rebirth image avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Clara's perceptual signature (honesty burden, pot as key). Dialogue natural/subtextual: her "this doesn’t make sense" pursues truth, his "sense is overrated" evades then softens. Rhythm modulates with intensity; minor register elevation fits literary tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Solid density/rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("ink pot" recurrence purposeful yet borders redundancy) and repeated "fair trade/mathematics" phrasing dull propulsion slightly. No major artifacts in closure; sensory integration propels. Template cadence absent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magic ink pot in funeral home transforms con artist/asylum tropes into textural honesty arc, with pot's pulse enabling breach. Risky "deathly vitality" tone heightens stakes organically. No derivative hedging; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
