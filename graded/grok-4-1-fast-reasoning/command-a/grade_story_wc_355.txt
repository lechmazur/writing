<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in cataloging silence for empathy, embodied in hands hovering and whispering; interiority concrete via sensory tuning but slips into stock phrases like "heart ached with a longing." Final recovery earns change via prior mystical buildup, but pacifist trait ornamental without conflicting choices. Contradictory impulses mild, lacking peak stress degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory symphony building density to clasp click and diary revelation; single scene oriented by ~50 words (workshop, Elara, diary). Closure as Charged Poise in closing diary and whispering "Thank you," reconfiguring empathy path with felt emotional cost legible in "recovered a piece of her own identity." One tightening via vision suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop anchors vividly with multi-sensory hum, rustle, wind; selective via POV urgency (vibrations, clasp surface). Diary clasp as micro-setting constrains core action, charges final cradle; shadows/stars evolve to dance and brighten, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial coherence clean, workshop tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock silences for empathy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tuning to vision to click, narrowing mystical options with deepening knowledge of grandmother. Agency in circles and coaxing forecloses force path; cost felt in "weight of her grandmother’s silence." Moral calculus subtle but coherent; no reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via silence emerges organically from diary pages and realization; final image of diary cradled against fireworks offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise. Subtext in clasp as "gateway" and "barrier" avoids direct moralizing until minor slip in "path to empathy was not just about...," but lingers via particulars. No Thematic Echo in peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "tuning frequencies" and vivid paintings; diction/rhythm modulates from deliberate circles to graceful stand. Voice distinct via idiosyncratic mysticism ("coaxing it to reveal secrets"); no dialogue or head-hopping. Psychic distance apt, tightening under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Smooth rhythm with varied openings, high density in sensory blends; minor paraphrase loop in "holding its breath" x2 early and silence varieties reiterations dull mid-section slightly (−0.4). No filter stacks or template cadence; figurative air thickening purposeful without muddle. Propulsion clear, minor overwriting in shadows dancing at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical frequency-unlocking with inheritance trope, transformed via pacifist empathy-silence angle; frequencies method inevitable from traits. Risk in theatrical lyricism heightens resonance without gimmick; no derivative echoes, particulars memorable in chime and fireworks sync.</comment>
