<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Queen's interiority is concrete via restless dreams and embodied unease clawed at chest, with contradictory fear-resolve impulses driving micro-choices like pressing on despite warnings; earned change from disenchantment to purpose lands cleanly at vow, but minor stock phrasing like "heart sank" slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup to chamber revelation (CR closure with conceptual cost of kingdom's burden legible in "weight of her people’s deeds"); orientation anchored early on balcony/ridge; single tightening via shadows parting suffices, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (gravel crunch, metallic scent, pulsing crystals) filters through queen's priorities, constraining climb via jagged archway and lacy menace; grotto constrains choices (slow ascent, warmer air pulses with heartbeat) and charges final sigh image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams/mystery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via voice's truth reweighting with kingdom's tipping scales; agency in reply and vow forecloses disenchantment path with felt responsibility cost, legible in sinking heart and softened glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile balance emerges organically from bleeding starlight realization mirroring kingdom deeds, with fireflies reprise reweighting prior beauty; resonant non-literal ending (light in heart vs. vanished fireflies) answers disenchantment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (dreams pull, fireflies steady); rhythmic prose modulates intensity (short sentences in chamber reveal); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (queen's steady reply vs. alien voice) advances revelation cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels ascent, sensory propulsion strong; minor paraphrase loops ("shared exhale" x2, pulsing/glowing motifs) and occasional elevated diction slightly drag momentum without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-quest fantasy via bleeding starlight lifeblood and lacy menace transforms tropes; risk in accumulative lyric ascent heightens stakes organically, with grotto sigh as inevitable reconfiguration from particulars.</comment>
