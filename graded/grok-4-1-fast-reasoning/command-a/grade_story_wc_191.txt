<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consistent traits like caution and curiosity drive micro-choices, such as recalling scrolls to peel paint; embodied reactions ("heart quickened") ground interiority; earned realization at throne shows change with cost of unclaimed power.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with motivated linkages (murals reveal waterfall path, flake confirms archway); orientation anchored immediately in orchard; CR closure lands on-page in "throne was not meant to be claimed by one person" with conceptual cost of collective legacy over personal gain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "pulsing fruit" and "bioluminescent vines" integrate into action, constraining path behind waterfall; kaleidoscopic colors evolve to beckon and mirror internal quest without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stairway by sunrise) signals early with one causal tightening at mechanism solve narrowing options; agency in sequencing symbols, but opposition remains puzzle-based without visceral reversal or high trade-off cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom balancing adventure emerges organically through murals' warning and throne twist; final image reconfigures personal quest into collective understanding without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with consistent perceptual signature focused on wondrous details; rhythmic prose modulates from exploratory to resonant at "stars above shifted into a single, blinding point."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Varied syntax and sensory propulsion maintain momentum; minor overwriting in opening ("shimmered with hues of forgotten eras") adds texture without obscuring, though glow motif repeats formulaically across beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes transformed via paint-peeling murals and collective-throne twist; fresh synthesis in ruby flake's truth-sensing feels organic, but quest arc remains familiar.</comment>
