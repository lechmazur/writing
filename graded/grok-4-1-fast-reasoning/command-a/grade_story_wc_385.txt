<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand echoes drives consistent choices like singing to probe and gazing into the pool, rooted in her perceptive traits. Interiority shows embodied longing ("reed-blown melancholy") shifting to resolve, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the pivotal pool scene. Change feels earned via vision, with felt cost in melancholy's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and revelations build from shell's hum to pool vision's CR, reweighting echoes as deliberate threads with conceptual cost in Elara's newfound purpose. Orientation anchored early in nexus; single scene coheres with one tightening (figure's challenge to pool). Closure legible in final resolve and glowing shell.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (pulsing ground, shell's warmth, liquid starlight) selectively filter through Elara's perceptive bias, guiding choices like archway step and pool kneel. Recurring shell constrains and charges final image, mirroring internal shift from shadow to light. Vivid, purposeful integration without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding echoes) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via shell hum, figure's test, and vision revelation that changes knowledge/options. Protagonist agency in probing song and resolute gaze forces stance crystallization; cost felt in melancholy yielding to resolve, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of echoes as profound ripples emerges organically from pool scenes, with final symphony image offering non-literal resonant answer to "why some echo." Subtext in transformed melancholy avoids moralizing; particulars like deliberate threads invite reflection on purpose without tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing (murmurs, hums, melodies). Poetic voice modulates rhythmically, distinct in Elara's sensory idiom; brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("ensure you are ready"). No head-hopping; compression taught early via whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but overwriting in high-pressure chamber (stacked modifiers like "shimmering archway," "liquid starlight") and minor loops ("voice rising" twice, echo repetitions) dull density without payoff. Information multi-jobs well elsewhere; no scaffold obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fantasy quest trope transformed via specific echo-weaving concept and perceptual singer's lens, with fresh synthesis in pool's memory-echoes. Final reconfiguration (singing along to cosmic hum) feels inevitable from particulars; risks poetic density without gimmickry.</comment>
