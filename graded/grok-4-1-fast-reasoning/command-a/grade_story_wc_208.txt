<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to keeper role, but interiority abstract ("turbine-hum reverie") lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; final change earned yet told via epiphany rather than micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to slide merge and map CR, reconfiguring art legacy with conceptual cost legible in "profound sense of purpose"; no orientation debt, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm, archway, and slide constrain choices (pulse unlocks passage) and charge closure carvings mirroring patterns; sensory selection purposeful, filtered through artistic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake to unlock slide secrets tightens via glow-passage-merge under accumulative lens, agency in placing slide forces realization with felt future burden; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of bridging eras via art emerges organically from slide-map, final driftwood image resonant non-literal answer reweighting layered meanings without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature on patterns/transformations; rhythmic texture modulates build to closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure, but minor paraphrase loops on "patterns" and "light" slightly dull peak chamber beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Timewoven alliances via lantern slides transform magic trope through sculptor's lens inventively; synthesis feels organic to closure image.</comment>
