<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to reawaken beauty roots consistently in traits and intensifies through assembly despite "betrayal," earning endurance at end. Interiority concrete in visions but leans summary in "spark of determination"; contradictory impulses emerge in machine taint hesitation without strong simultaneous action. Final cradling shows earned renunciation with cost, but embodied emotion sometimes clichéd like "heart sank" and "heart quaking."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from library hypothesis to cavern discovery/assembly to CR closure in "bitterly sweet truth" reweighting premise with conceptual cost of sacrifice. Orientation anchored early in palace/stalactites. One tightening at machine activation narrows options; no micro turns disrupt, structure fits two-shard default (library-descent-return).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suspended palace and stalactites constrain descent choice and charge final edge-gazing image; cavern blue light and black pedestal guide assembly urgency. Sensory details (damp stone, cold air, glow) selective via Kael's priorities, mirroring internal decay vs hope. Micro-setting (lantern flicker, egg warmth) embodies progression without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via machine taint complication, assembly agency despite dread, and voice's cost demand forcing realization. One deepening at visions forecloses forced beauty path with felt opportunity cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in final gazing, protagonist endurance visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Flawed genesis theme emerges organically from lore, machine intrusion, and closing realization, reweighting mechanical progress vs preservation without moralizing. Egg shifts from hope symbol to nurture demand in final image, inviting ambiguity on sacrifice. Subtext in "taint reached" gesture layers beauty's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in reverie-tinged noticing (e.g., "whispered of flawed genesis"). Prose texture rhythmic, modulating from weary exposition to intensified cavern beats; no dialogue to judge. Psychic distance tightens aptly at egg-holding without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., assembly advances plot/character/dread); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("heart quaking with both fear and reverie") during peak but pattern-taught as tone; zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms mechanical-vs-nature trope via egg-machine hybrid, yielding fresh CR on flawed genesis choice. Suspended palace/egg synthesis feels organic, inevitable in hindsight; risk in bittersweet stasis heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
