<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical-playful traits shine in her dance-like restoration and hesitation before the obsidian-eyed woman's call, creating internal conflict that earns her heart-led hum; contradictory impulses act on-page, but final realization edges toward unearned epiphany without deeper embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sound waves building density to CR closure—Elara's hum reconfigures the garden and her certainty as a cage; orientation anchors early via garden and mural, one tightening via coin's glow and figures' emergence suffices, cost legible in foreclosed methodical cage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden vividly constrains via harmonizing frequencies awakening the mural, charging final alive-garden image; metallic flowers and vibrations filter through Elara's restorer bias, evolving causally with her hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoration tightens accumulatively via coin's whisper and figures' demand, forcing agency in humming over hands; one deepening exchange narrows options with felt cost of certainty's cage, legible in final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of exchanging certainty for curiosity emerges organically from sound-art interplay and Elara's arc, resonating in final tapestry image without moralizing; returning hobo nickel shifts meaning non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in Elara's art-conversing lens; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("exchange certainty for curiosity") advances pressure; rhythmic prose modulates poetically without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose propels with varied rhythm and sensory density, but minor overwriting in "colors exploding into life, figures dancing" risks purple strain during climax without payoff; no loops, high info density supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-wave garden and animated hobo nickel transforms magical awakening trope via restorer's curiosity; risk in nested echoes pays off in inevitable garden-self reprise.</comment>
