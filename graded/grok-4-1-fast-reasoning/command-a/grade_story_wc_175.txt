<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories intensifies through embodied sensing of the monarch absence and ritual building, with micro-choices like adding the monarch wing revealing values. Interiority concrete via attuned pauses and humming, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat. No strong flawed endurance with visible cost; persists ideally without complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from spiral construction to rustling shift, humming anchor, and final descent with Charged Poise closure in lingering spiral image. Cost legible in "monarchs’ absence" and world's breath-holding, reweighting transient signals. Orientation anchored early in grotto; one tightening via air's interrupted cadence suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (moss-covered stone, rustling air, moth wing iridescence) filter through Elara's bias, mirroring internal unsettlement. Grotto constrains via "transiently rooted" stance and guides ritual choices; moth wing charges final glimmer. Evolves causally with sun's dip; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring histories amid monarch scarcity) signaled early, tightens texturally via sensed rustle and scarce migration, narrowing to urgent final addition. Agency in humming and wing placement forecloses inaction path; cost felt in absence's weight on closure image. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilient transience emerges organically from moth/monarch wings shifting to testament of beauty in fragility, resonant in final spiral's lingering message. No moralizing; CR reweights premise via purposeful descent amid interrupted cadence. Complexity lingers in world's holding breath without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: esoteric attunement to whispers, rhythms, unseen hums. Lyrical diction modulates from descriptive to charged humming beat; rhythm varies purposefully without filter stacks. No dialogue; compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action, image, interiority without paraphrase loops. Minor overwriting in "fragment of a forgotten dream" and repeated hand-moves, but purposeful under lyric texture; no template cadence or muddled metaphors dulling closure. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; opening anchors voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of esoteric rituals in cloud grotto transforms nature symbolism via wind signals and monarch absence into urgent textural drive. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry; no template echoes, particulars (moth wing spiral) feel inevitable to closure.</comment>
