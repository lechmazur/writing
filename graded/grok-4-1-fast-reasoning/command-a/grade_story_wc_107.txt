<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but lapses into diagnostic self-awareness like "those cracks were where the light entered, where growth began," flattening emotional contradiction; final symbolic choice feels earned but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal glassblowing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via reflections and work to Charged Poise CR at bookmark placement in sphere, reconfiguring control-to-abandon with felt conceptual cost of vulnerability; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (dust-laden screens, visible breath, molten glass glow) mirrors internal thaw purposefully; abandoned control room as "perfect canvas" constrains choice of site and charges final image of spheres amid relics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake of crafting safe zones deepens accumulatively through realization of "abandon" as letting go, narrowing fear-of-unknown option with felt cost in final gesture; pressure coherent but lacks live reversal, relying on reflective cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-growth emerges organically from glass spheres and cracks motif, with resonant non-literal final image of bookmark-in-sphere reweighting premise; minor overtness in "cracks were where the light entered" borders echo but doesn't replace scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct contemplative perceptual signature in selective noticing (frayed bookmark edges, glass fragility); rhythmic modulation suits reflective intensity, prose texture purposeful without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive thaw/melt metaphors and paraphrase loops in reflective blocks (e.g., multiple "thawing heart" restatements) create density drag without payoff; figurative overwriting in high-reflection beats dulls propulsion, though syntax varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower in control room crafting inquiry-spheres transforms relic-setting into safe zones with thawing ice ingenuity; final bookmark placement feels inevitable, risking overt symbolism but heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
