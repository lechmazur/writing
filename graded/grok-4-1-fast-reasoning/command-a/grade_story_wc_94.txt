<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in hesitation over envelope, embodied in trembling hands and timer vigil; shift to writing earned by scar-map realization with felt cost of confronting past. Minor slip in abstract "singular clarity" phrasing avoids 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from envelope arrival to map reveal and timer silence as Resonant Reconfiguration; closure cost legible in "uncensored hands" forging future. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and glass dome constrain isolation and mirror internal turmoil, charging thunderclap-sealed writing as final image; timer and desk tactile, lived-in via tracing and ticking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of scar confrontation signaled early tightens via timer click and map personalization under Accumulative lens, narrowing to uncensored writing with legible emotional cost; single deepening forecloses censored past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scars-as-map motif emerges organically to reweight censorship theme, final pen stroke offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; complexity in betrayal regrets lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with poetic perceptual signature (scar cartography lens) and rhythmic modulation under storm pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but figurative piling ("charged with electricity, both literal and metaphorical") in opening slightly muddles peak hesitation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Body-as-scar-map premise transforms introspection trope freshly; stormlit observatory synthesis feels organic and risky without gimmick.</comment>
