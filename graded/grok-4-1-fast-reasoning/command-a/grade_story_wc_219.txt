<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Skepticism vs fascination shown in "warring" impulses during ascent, with micro-choice to nod at pilgrim revealing values; final softening to awe feels earned via amber merging but borders abstract epiphany without deeper embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to CR closure ("chemistry of homecoming... experience to be felt"); cost legible in worldview shift at summit pedestal, orientation anchored early in tower base scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (wet stone, blooming flowers) filter through Elara's priorities and mirror renewal/decay; amber as micro-setting constrains choice and charges final merge image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homecoming understanding) deepens accumulatively via pilgrim encounter and summit map; pressure coheres but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally narrowing live options at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming emerges organically from pilgrimage particulars and final CR image without moralizing; resonant reweighting in "mirror reflecting the human condition" ties arc to post-contact complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in skeptical tracing of symbols and biased noticing of alien fusion; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet ascent to awe-charged summit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/image; minor overwriting in repeated motifs like "bronze quiet" purposeful but borders figurative muddle in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh post-contact pilgrimage synthesis transforms relic tower into nexus; amber map as homecoming device offers non-obvious angle, with risk in poetic conceit heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
