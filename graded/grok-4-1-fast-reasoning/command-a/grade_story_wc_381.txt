<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, compelling ritual choices; embodied focus on breath/heart sync shows particularity. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during resistance—"determination never wavered" flattens internal struggle, reducing earned depth at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from mapping to resonance/surge; closure as Charged Poise in "sealing the prophecy within a silent void" with fragile cost ("balance was fragile") legible on page. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via thrashing resistance narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory selection purposeful (brook gurgle/scent guide alignment); setting integrates via brook pause/mirror evolution, charging final image "brook...now a mirror reflecting the starry sky." POV bias filters tranquility as aid; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via resonance density/resistance forces endurance agency with deepening surge. Cost felt in fragile vigilance but abstract scale limits visceral charge—no live option foreclosed beyond internal will.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as fragile shield emerges organically from ritual to final beacon image; resonant non-literal close in "silence was both weapon and shield" reweights prior hush without moralizing. Particulars like wing/brook avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in silence/flow bias; rhythmic texture modulates from fluid to poised. No dialogue; diction controlled, prose reflects ritual mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some overwriting in metaphors ("weaving threads of moonlight," "tranquil blaze") muddles high-pressure surge; minor loops ("began," "felt" repetition) dull propulsion. Rhythms vary overall, density solid but scaffold hedges in reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh origami relic/terrestrially cosmic hush transforms summoner trope via fluid ritual; oxymoronic "tranquil blaze" inflects stakes organically. Risks poetic internalization effectively without gimmickry.</comment>
