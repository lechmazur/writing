<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity and preservation drive compelling micro-choices like ignoring the communicator and outlasting dawn, with embodied emotions (lump in throat, heavy heart) revealing internal conflict. Mentor legacy anchors motivation without unearned epiphany. Final endurance feels earned by prior defiance against erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from site approach to message discovery to dawn pressure, yielding Charged Poise closure in the final photo and departure with clutched sand grain. Orientation anchored early (crater inspector on summit). Cost legible in "heavy heart" and impermanence as site fades.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar specifics (regolith crunch, visor fog, module dulled surface) constrain via suit tools and dawn horizon, filtering through Elara's priorities. Final rays on shadow charge image, mirroring loss. No white-room; tactile and selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document before terraforming) tightens accumulatively via message deepening commitment and dawn forcing endurance. Agency in outlasting forecloses return option with emotional cost. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Preservation vs. progress emerges organically through message plea, sand grain reprise, and final image reweighting impermanence without moralizing. Sand grain shifts from memento to clutched testament. Resonant ambiguity in legacy's endurance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward eerie stillness and artifacts; lyrical rhythm modulates from hushed focus to melancholic dawn. No head-hopping or withholding; diction suits curious inspector.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short crunch steps to expansive dawn); high density integrates sensory/action. Minor paraphrase loops ("melancholy" variants, "dawning hush") but not obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Apollo preservation and timed chem-message transforms sci-fi trope; mentor's defiance via lunar chemistry feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk in dawn Charged Poise heightens stakes.</comment>
