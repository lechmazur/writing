<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in dial-twists and shard responses, but diagnostic labels like "She realized her mistake" and "she understood" in pivotal beats feel unembodied and trigger -0.5 penalty for label-speak, flattening emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in discards, glow shifts, and melody swell to CR closure ("silence was not the absence of sound but the space where all possibilities began"); one tightening at shard dimming suffices with legible conceptual cost in letting go.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower console and gorge shadows constrain tuning choices; recurring shard glow charges final city-rebirth image, with sensory wind/static integrated purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock shard) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via assumption discards narrowing options; shard falter forces trade-off with felt glow/cost legibility, charging final chorus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-potential emerges from particulars like static-to-melody, but final paragraph's "The beginning in every ending was not a destination but a process" articulates thesis directly (-0.6 for thematic echo), replacing resonant image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward silence patterns; rhythmic modulation in short sentences during dimming builds pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "shard’s glow" repetitions across beats (-0.4) and template cadence in melody descriptions dull propulsion slightly; density strong otherwise, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Hollywood shard as hush-key in suspended radio-city transforms relic trope organically; risk in abstract discards pays off in city-rebirth reconfiguration.</comment>
