<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but lacks embodied contradiction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; competent guardian shows no genuine struggle or blind spots compounding before resolution. Interiority abstract and declarative rather than concrete-particular. Final endurance lacks visible micro-cost tied to traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of inquiries building to CR closure: declaration reweights assumptions as clarity, possession dissolves with conceptual cost of exposed voids. Orientation anchored early. One meaningful deepening via painting shifts pattern to declaration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Anchor's "muffled clarity" and responsive tremors constrain priest's rhetorical actions and charge final silence image. Sensory hierarchy selective (resonant silence, shifting walls) reflects POV urgency. Purposeful integration mirrors internal unraveling without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt possession) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tremor to shudder to recoil; priest's agency in questions/painting narrows options with felt time pressure. Cost legible in "race against time" and growing hunger. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of assumptions/voids as power emerges organically from inquiries and black painting; final image of balanced silence offers resonant CR without moral. Declaration borders thematic echo but integrates as climax action. Complexity lingers in mirror question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in looping echoes and void-noticing; rhythmic texture modulates from whisper to declaration under pressure. Purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synonym loops on "silence" (resonant/absence/presence) and "unraveled" across beats dull density (-0.6); paraphrase in anchor responses (tremor/shudder/cracking). Figurative coherent but heavy in peak (palette "shimmering like a void"). Propulsion strong despite artifacts not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic priest, black-void palette, and assumption-devourer transforms guardian trope; "looping voice" and rhetorical keys feel inevitable. Risks abstract fantasy with specificity (palette in air). Non-obvious moral calculus on unknown as fabric heightens stakes.</comment>
