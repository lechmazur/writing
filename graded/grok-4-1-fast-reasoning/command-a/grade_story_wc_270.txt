<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under guard pressure reveal insurgent traits; contradictory cherish/fear of telepathy acts simultaneously. Final resolve to lead rebirth earned by prior plant guidance and embryo warmth. Minor backstory tell in Elara mention slightly dilutes pivot but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers to decode to guard to unsealing builds density to RR closure in "The unsealing began with a whisper, then a roar" with visions' fade as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in hot springs/kite. Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hot springs steam/heat/bubbles constrain decoding and charge eruption climax; plants as micro-setting mirror internal rebirth via tactile whispers. Sensory hierarchy (traced symbols, pulsing warmth) POV-specific. Final fluttering kite recharges setting motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unseal vs regime burial) tightens accumulatively via guard hesitation forcing calm micro-choice, deepening to embryo sync. Cost legible in breathless fade of visions and regime fear. Guard coincidence complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rebirth/evolution theme emerges organically from kite cycles, plant symphony, embryo seed; final "plant the seeds of a new era" reconfigures Reconstruction premise without moralizing. Ambiguity in regime evolution lingers plausibly. No thematic echo artifacts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in plant "whispers" and elderly "wrinkled finger" bias. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual: "This place belongs to us all" pursues goal. Rhythm modulates to crackle/roar peak without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers trembled as she began to decode"); varied rhythm accelerates to "air crackled." Minor plant-whisper repetition purposeful, no loops or overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic flora, kite-map embryo in post-uprising world transforms tropes; kite-frayed tail to fluttering script arc feels inevitable. Risky grandmother insurgent heightened by guard crumble.</comment>
