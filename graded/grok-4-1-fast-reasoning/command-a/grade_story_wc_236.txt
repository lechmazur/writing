<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—loss adrift vs. sharpened senses—act in scene through precise hands and screw engagement; final realization earned by prior causality with visible cost in bittersweet smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to on-page CR closure in final paragraph ("through occluded views, she had learned"); cost legible in reframing loss as ordinary miracle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Screw as micro-setting handled tactilely constrains Elara's realization and charges final image beside repaired clock; fogged windows and drip echo emotional terrain mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humanize overlooked amid loss) signaled early, deepens via Mira's return and screw-handling reversal narrowing to realization; agency in "May I?" forecloses isolation path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles emerges organically from screw and clock images; Mira's "miracles were in the ordinary" line creates thematic echo, diluting subtext in penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in smell-loss compensation (heightened senses via touch/warmth); dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing Mira's hesitation from Elara's steady voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels to closure; minor paraphrase loop in "steady/trembling calm" repetitions across paragraphs slightly dulls density without obscuring final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of smell-loss aromatherapist in clock shop transforms relic screw into generational/emotional bridge; risk in quiet CR realization heightens stakes organically.</comment>
