<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to trace origins is consistent but told via labels like "dappled resolve" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; final purpose shift lacks embodied micro-choices under pressure, as in the map alignment beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern discoveries tightening to stamp activation as CR (library as gateway reweights premise); closure lands on-page with felt cost of waning blackout urgency; orientation anchored early in sunken library blackout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and bowed shelves vividly constrain path through dim corridors; recurring stillness subtly mirrors internal resolve, charging final chamber image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-tracing signaled early escalates accumulatively via patterns to map/stamp deepening (blackout as catalyst narrows options); agency in pressing stamp forces payoff with legible time cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Honesty-in-stillness theme emerges organically from discoveries without statement; final illumination offers resonant CR repricing origins, though ambiguity leans tidy without strong counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature attuned to "whispers" and creaks; rhythmic prose modulates intensity effectively, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in stillness descriptions ("reclaimed stillness," "profound...hum") and repeated "resolve" dull density slightly; rhythm varies but elevated diction borders overwriting in high-pressure map beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sunken library gateway via stamp offers fresh synthesis of discovery quest; transforms tropes through bioluminescent details and blackout catalyst without close famous echoes.</comment>
