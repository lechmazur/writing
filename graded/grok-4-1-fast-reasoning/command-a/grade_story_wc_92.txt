<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in guarded knowledge and revolution, shown via puzzle-solving micro-choices; Thorne applies secondary pressure effectively. Interiority concrete in "heart quickened" under confrontation. Minor label-speak in "calmly inventive spirit flared" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → sundial investigation → key discovery → confrontation → activation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara at post, courtyard, twilight). Closure DC on-page at "cradle of sparks roared to life" with cost in implied ongoing danger as she slips away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sundial as micro-setting constrains choice, revealing compartment via traced angles. Sensory hierarchy fits urgency: dying torches, footsteps in blackout narrow to immediacies. Atmosphere tensions theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (activate cradle for revolution) signaled early, tightens via Thorne confrontation narrowing options. Agency in swift key insertion drives DC; cost legible in Thorne's narrowed eyes and her shadowed escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as beacon emerges via cradle awakening oppressed; subtext in Thorne hesitation. Final image reconfigures rebellion as "wake-up call" without moralizing, reweighting premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (suspicion of blackout). Dialogue subtext-heavy: Thorne's warning vs. Elara's "it's about them." Prose texture distinct but minor filter verbs like "mind raced" dull one peak.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short activation sentences accelerating climax; density high in sundial scene. Minor artifacts: paraphrase in "faint flicker... faint shimmer," cliché "heart quickened"—−0.4 total, not touching closure. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cradle as beacon transforms revolution trope via sundial cipher. Fresh synthesis: quill-key match enables silent intrigue, risking boldness in Thorne standoff heightens without gimmick.</comment>
