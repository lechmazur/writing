<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacifist resolve anchors motivation consistently, enabling the final endurance of shadow work with felt cost in spirit lightening. Interiority concrete in grips on tear and heart racing amid steady resolve, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—mostly declarative traits without deep embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anomaly beep to portal opening, stitching ruins, final awakening as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost of transformed shadows legible in spilling light. Orientation anchored early in ship/void/mission; single scene with portal shard transition fits scope; one tightening at scars prompting stitch narrows to renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tear as recurring micro-setting constrains core placement and charges final beacon image; ruins/soil/vibrant air selectively sensory, mirroring internal shift via tactile stitching. Atmosphere purposeful—humming resonance tensions ethereal tone without generic drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension for survival) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via anomaly pull, scarred world deepening shadow work demand, final stitch crystallizing stance with visible cost in soul-mending foreclosing isolation. Agency in tear placement and air-stitching drives under lens; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of compassion transforming shadow emerges organically via pacifism/tear/stitching particulars, resonant non-literal answer in awakened light reweighting violence's failure without moralizing. Subtext in ruins' scars implying universal renewal; avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: pacifist lens filters void as sanctuary, noticing tear's coolth/compassion amid crisis. Lyrical voice modulates rhythm for emotional poise, diction purposeful without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short alert beeps to flowing stitch cadence); density high, sentences multi-job via image/action. Minor paraphrase loops in gravity shifts and stitching ("each stitch... every thread") dull propulsion slightly, but no closure touch.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spiritual relic/shadow work in sci-fi portal via stitching tears transforms tropes organically; risky lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes in personal renewal without gimmick.</comment>
