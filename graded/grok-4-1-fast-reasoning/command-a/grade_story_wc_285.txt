<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation to distill essence via needle and awareness compels the inward turn, with embodied grip tightening under fog pressure; figure as secondary applies revelatory pressure. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from ambient rhythms to CR closure in "nothing is ever truly erased" whisper and fog lift; cost legible in perceptual reweighting foreclosing blind seeking. Single scene oriented early; figure arrival patterns as density break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain gutters' ticking and fog constrain choices, charging final lift image; sensory hierarchy (ticking heartbeat-sync, churning river) mirrors internal layers via coachman's attentive filter. Micro-setting (needle, scroll) tethers abstraction to tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover promise signaled early, tightens via figure's scroll words narrowing to inward realization; ticking clock adds cadence shift under accumulative lens. Agency in whispered understanding forecloses path with felt perceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Palimpsest theme emerges organically from needle threads, fog layers, and revelation, reweighting premise in final carriage-forward image without moral state. Subtext in figure's dissolving form invites ambiguity on erasure's weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of ambient filtering (e.g., "senses percolating through the mist"); voice rhythm modulates from serene to sharpened attention. Sparse dialogue subtextual, advancing revelation naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops, though minor paraphrase in fog-layer motifs; rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax breathes with ticking cadence to charged poise close. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yarn needle as relic transforms mystic trope into thread-binding insight, with fog-parting risk heightening perceptual stakes organically. Fresh palimpsest lens on erasure feels inevitable from established rhythms.</comment>
