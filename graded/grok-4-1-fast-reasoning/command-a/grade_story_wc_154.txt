<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in translator's resolve to heal via decryption, with embodied numbness and ache during pivotal unknotting; innocence liability creates contradiction acted out in determination shift. Minor label-speak ("shrewdly innocent," "lotus-hearted") slightly abstracts peak realization without cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sequential phrase unknottings ("The coral remembers," map reveal) tightening knowledge to CR closure in final image of steady coral glow and ocean's song. Orientation anchored early (atrium, Elara, twilight); cost legible in "innocence felt like a liability" reconfiguring purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring coral fragment constrains decryption and charges final image as "beacon of hope"; mist/jasmine/condensation selectively mirror internal shift from ache to resolve, evolving causally with revelations. Sensory hierarchy fits translator's bias toward symbols of resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft meaning via decryption) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through intensifying glow and phrase reveals narrowing to promise of sanctuary; agency in deft fingering forecloses numbness with determination cost. One tightening sufficient, felt in wrist ache and resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience amid ruin emerges organically from coral/notes/map, culminating in non-literal CR ("ocean still sings") reweighting wounds as purpose; ambiguity in silences bridged lingers. Minor overtness in "lotus-hearted ache" echoes thesis without full abstraction penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (language unknotting, symbols pulsing); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compressing under revelation pressure. No dialogue; diction purposeful, perceptual bias translator-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative density ("shield too thin," "bloomed into purpose") in decryption beat risks muddle (-0.4); minor paraphrase loops ("ache" variants, "unknot" stems) dull mid-section without closure touch. Rhythm varies, syntax supports lyric cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war relic (child's cast/coral) as hope map transforms translation trope; final "threshold" reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric compression heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
