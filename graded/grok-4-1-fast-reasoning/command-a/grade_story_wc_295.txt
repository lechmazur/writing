<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in healing fractured memories drives micro-choices like adjusting the telescope, with embodied reactions (trembling fingers, quickened heart); internal conflict emerges in silent burdens acknowledged at climax. Minor slips in stock phrasing ("burned brighter than any star") and summary epiphanies slightly dilute particularity, but change feels earned via star patterns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as star observations build density to CR closure: Elara's writing reconfigures personal burdens with felt cost of vulnerability in "no longer alone." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via constellation pattern narrows interpretive options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory's dome, machinery, and telescopes constrain choices (aligning lenses, scribbling under pulsing light); variable stars as micro-setting charge final harmony insight. Sensory selection (hum, cool air, flickering patterns) filters through chronicler's priorities, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding for personal healing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via rhythm match to constellation emergence, forcing deepening realization that forecloses solitary endurance. Agency in persistent observation yields visible cost of self-acknowledgment; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges organically from telegram, inscriptions, and stars into resonant CR: final writing as "tapestry of hope" reweights isolation without moralizing. Minor direct statement ("no burden was meant to be carried alone") echoes thesis, docking score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (stars "whispering secrets," pulsing rhythms); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically from anticipation to solace. Compression in observations feels taught and legible under accumulative lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "burdens" and "stars" (e.g., repeated "shared burdens," "light" motifs) create synonym churn across realization beats, dulling density; minor template cadence in interior summaries. Rhythm varies but overwriting ("river of light," "tapestry") risks muddle in peak insight without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stargazing as inscription decoding transforms trope of cosmic insight; daylily telegram and variable stars yield inevitable personal arc. Bold lyric risk in accumulative patterns heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
