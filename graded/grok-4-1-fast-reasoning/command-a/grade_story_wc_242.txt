<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in Eli's unease with the disc ("fingers drumming absently," heart quickens, trembling fingers); contradictory impulses surface when he plays despite cultivated estrangement, earning the closure call. Final choice feels motivated by accumulating connections without safety-hedging. Minor slip: internal conflict mostly sequential rather than simultaneous in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: calls build pattern density to cadence shift at realization ("disc wasn’t just an object—it was a key"), landing Charged Poise/CR closure with felt cost (exhaustion, dissolving estrangement) in final dialing scene. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (slick walls, rust, damp gnawing like loneliness) mirrors internal states and constrains via tunnel shrinking around melody. Disc as micro-setting charges choices and final warm-to-touch image. POV bias clear in Eli's relic-naming; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (estrangement vs. connection) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via repeating melody calls narrowing to disc-play deepening; agency in blowing note forecloses isolation with legible cost (tunnel shrinks, trembling). Climax realization tests commitment coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of continuity ("teach endings how to begin") emerges organically from call fragments and disc-weaving, reweighted in final "ready to begin" without moralizing; resonant image of warm disc ties particulars. Complexity lingers in loop acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (Eli's coined terms like "melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, diction biased (haunting familiarity). Brief dialogue natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows), purposeful figures ("gnawed like the damp air") without muddle; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Propulsion aligns with scene: crystalline note accelerates climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal phone loops and harmonica relic transforms isolation trope into continuity bridge; risk in time-weaving premise pays off inevitably at dialing closure. No derivative echoes; bold voice anchors originality.</comment>
