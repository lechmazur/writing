<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's shift from haunted guinea pig to dream-weaver feels earned via embodied drumming and tears at realization, revealing contradictory victim/creator impulses. Interiority particular through habitual tapping amid memory chaos. Minor abstractness in "auroral sorrow" softens peak embodiment without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (ripples, hum matching drumming) tightens to CR closure: memories reconfigured as bridge, cost in purifying tears legible at "Tears streamed down her face." Orientation anchored immediately in garden; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lagoon and stone micro-setting constrain perch and charge final glow intensification, mirroring internal unraveling. Sensory hierarchy (hum vibration, glowing ripples) POV-specific, urgent narrowing to water's response. No white-room; purposeful selectivity evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via drumming-lagoon sync forcing realization stance. Agency in leaning/closing eyes forecloses victim path with tear-cost. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memories-as-bridge emerges organically from lagoon hum and shared faces, final image ("weaver of dreams") non-literally reweighting treatment premise without moralizing. Subtext in purifying tears embraces sorrow's complexity. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic drumming/noticing; lyrical diction modulates to crescendo at realization. No head-hopping or elision; voice texture biased to harmonic rebellion. Minor overwrought phrasing fits experimental tone without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (drumming echoes hum); rhythm varies with scene hush-to-crescendo. Minor figurative density ("liquid memory," "frayed tapestry") in setup doesn't muddle peak realization. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic garden, memory entanglement, guinea-pig rebellion into CR weaver arc; risk-taking lyric accumulation heightens stakes via responsive lagoon. No template tropes; inevitable hindsight from early hush/inhaling frame.</comment>
