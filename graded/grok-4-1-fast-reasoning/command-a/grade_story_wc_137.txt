<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic trait anchors early motivation, but climax epiphany ("Elara’s skepticism began to fade") tells tidy resolution without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure at final transcription and starlight shower; cost legible in internalized magic foreclosing skeptical void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower pedestal and tile constrain placement choice and charge final dissolving pattern; sensory details (warmth, melody, whales breaching) selectively mirror internal pull.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake of unnamed longing tightens accumulatively via tile's guidance to tower visions; one deepening at 3D pattern forces stance shift, but stakes remain abstract over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of patterned harmony emerges organically from tile visions and whale-stars sync; final sharing image offers resonant reconfiguration of skepticism without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with stargazer-biased perceptual signature (swirling constellations, unheard symphony); rhythmic modulation heightens visionary intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor "felt/seemed" synonym churn dulls tower vision peak; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magic square tile entangled with whales and memories synthesizes fresh bridge between math, nature, and self; transforms skeptic trope via specific cosmic pattern.</comment>
