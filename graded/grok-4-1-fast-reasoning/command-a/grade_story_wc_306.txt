<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role, but interiority relies on abstract symbolism over embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene; no deep internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure, making the fulfillment feel unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of symbols building to CR closure in the letter-sealing image, where shard reconfigures doubt with felt symbolic cost; single scene anchored early, one tightening via chimes' deliberate sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse, wind, chimes, and dawn light selectively constrain actions (tugging coat, echoing steps) and charge final image; sensory details (salt scent, fragmented reflections) mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling doubt) signaled early with textural deepening via chimes narrowing to balance message; low external pressure, but symbolic cost legible in broken resolve and growth room.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of nuance in doubt emerges organically from symbols and chimes, with final shard image offering resonant CR without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in acceptance of uncertainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in symbolic noticing; rhythmic prose modulates reflectively, but occasional elevated diction borders register drift in peak interpretive moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Good density and varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on chimes/wind and heavy figurative layering (e.g., "whisper of truth from the universe") dull propulsion in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conscience-for-hire with wind-chime divination transforms doubt trope into inevitable textual pattern; risk in symbolic method heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
