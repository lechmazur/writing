<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to shape a new dawn roots in consistent whimsy and intensifies via beam loss and resolve; interiority concrete in laughter shifts from soft to battle cry. Minor slip in told motivation ("Their motivation was clear") before full embodiment, but final realization earned with cost in foreclosed control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine density builds to pattern break (beam veers), tightens via fog resistance, closure as Charged Poise in gateway stabilization with beings' emergence and ongoing work. Cost legible in "the beam was no longer under their control" resolved by steering; orientation anchored early in lighthouse under stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wick as recurring object constrains choices (adjusts, grasps to steer) and charges final image via total internal reflection carving fog path. Atmosphere of shadowed elation selective via green glow on waves and pulsing fog; spatial choreography coherent in lantern room to horizon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape dawn via beam) signaled early, tightens via veer and fog churn forcing agency in steering under Accumulative lens. One deepening (panic to curiosity) narrows options; cost felt in resistance but resolved with unshakable resolve charging final green dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of routine bridging worlds emerges via particulars like prophetic twists and fog gateway, reweighted in beings' bow ("You have steered us home"). Final image offers resonant answer without moralizing; ambiguity in "work far from over" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in laughter echoes and light slicing; rhythmic control modulates from whimsy to awe. Voice distinct in syntax like "slicing through the night like a sword of light," apt for otherworldly texture; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative density (e.g., "weaving the past into the future") borders overwriting in setup without pattern payoff, dulling early propulsion. Rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse sentinel myth with physics-magic wick and green dawn gateway; wick's total internal reflection transforms trope ingeniously. Risk in otherworldly routine pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
