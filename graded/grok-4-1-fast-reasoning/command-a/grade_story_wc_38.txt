<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in mission to liberate knowledge, intensifying to dance climax; embodied emotion in trembling fingers and fluid movements. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during key pressure of chamber anomaly. Final endurance earned but without deep internal conflict or visible flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via imagery patterns (shadows, drips, symbols) and holds to closure; DC at walls shifting from dance unlocks passages. Orientation anchored by para 1 (sunken lab, Elara's purpose). Cost felt in "surge of triumph" reconfiguring lab from tomb to awakened space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (damp moss, decay scent, dripping water) mirrors defiance; pedestal/journal constrains dance choice, charging climax image. Details evolve causally (chamber hum, walls shift). POV bias to cryptic patterns selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate knowledge) signaled para 1, escalates accumulatively via anomaly chamber to dance tightening that narrows obscurity with agency in movements. One deepening forecloses silence via unlocking; cost legible in lab's transformation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-to-strength emerges organically from dance translating fragility into power, reweighted in final lab rebirth image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (dice pulse to silence) invites ambiguity on legacy. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (rhythms, symbols, whispers); voice texture modulates from calm exploration to fluid intensity in dance. Compression purposeful and pattern-taught; diction biased to code-breaking lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in dance climax); high density integrates image/action. Minor repetition ("calm defiance," "defiance") purposeful but borders loop in para 4-5; no scaffold or muddled metaphors touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of code-breaking via dance/dice in sunken lab transforms trope of lost knowledge into bodily cipher; risk in lyric structure heightens rebirth stakes. Turn at journal anomaly earned from prior patterns, feels inevitable.</comment>
