<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like pressing seeds into glass reveals character under pressure; personal stake with grandmother's memory earns final peace. Minor slip in diagnostic labels like "longing, a warmth" slightly abstracts emotion without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed visualizations to seed-fueled CR closure where paths' migratory nature reconfigures meaning with acceptance cost. Orientation anchored early in cave/geode; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shimmering violet/gold walls humming energy) filter through Lira's priorities and mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Cave and glass constrain choices by enabling/reflecting transliteration, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recollect path) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failed grasps to emotion-focus with seeds, foreclosing direct memory grasp for realization. Cost legible in flickering image and lighter heart amid void.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovery emerges organically from particulars like dissolving images and seed traces; final gathering offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in migratory memories enriches without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (ethereal patterns as emotions); lyrical diction modulates with intensity, prose as character in her whimsical noticing. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies purposefully, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor overwriting in stacked descriptors (e.g., "smooth, glowing surface") but doesn't obscure peak CR image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recollectionist premise with fantasy objects transforms memory trope via specific conjecture mechanics; risk in quiet CR ending heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
