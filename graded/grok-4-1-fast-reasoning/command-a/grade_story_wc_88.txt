<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in past fragments compels immersion choices effectively; embodied panic on ball drop reveals character under pressure. Internal conflict between erasure and lingering echoes acts in scene but resolves via summary epiphany rather than peak contradictory impulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build through glow/swim to CR closure; "labyrinth wasn’t a place; it was a state of mind" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of carrying empathy "even when it hurt" legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake vividly anchors early, constrains choices via hypnotic pull and warm water inviting depth; final "glow lingering in his eyes" charges closure image with tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of kindling empathy escalates accumulatively via ball drop to deeper swim narrowing options; agency in wading tests commitment with felt cost of surfacing changed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable choices emerges from particulars like ball sinking and symbols; final image reweights "clean slate" premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in glow hues and ripple distortions; syntax modulates rhythmically from calm reflection to urgent submersion without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in "forgotten galaxy" opening purposeful but borders overwriting in peak swim beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-traveler relic catalyzing mystic realization transforms tropes organically; risk in surreal lake-mindshift heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
