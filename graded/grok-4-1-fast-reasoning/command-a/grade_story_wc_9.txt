<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied regret culminate in earned shift at palm press ("stone in her chest" to tears), with contradictory impulses (duties vs. family) driving micro-choices like shedding cloak. Flawless solo-POV execution under pressure. Final renunciation of burdens feels character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; density tightens from shuffle to glowing crack visions as RR/Charged Poise, with legible cost in swirling missed moments. Orientation anchored immediately ("midnight glade above clouds"). Closure image ("no longer felt like a wound") reconfigures stake undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Saucer crack as micro-setting constrains pivotal choice (palm press triggers light) and charges final image (cradled as reminder). Sensory selection (hum, heavy air, ethereal glow) mirrors internal fracture purposefully. Choking beauty evolves causally with emotional release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost time) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via cards (Tower collapse) to vision-deepening that narrows options (presence over absence). Agency in pressing palm forecloses regret path with felt cost (tears at "kaleidoscope of what could have been").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time's fragility emerges organically from saucer fracture and visions, reweighted in final image ("beauty in imperfection") without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; lingering ambiguity in "moments still waiting" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature ("willingly perplexed," onyx shimmer). Voice modulates rhythmically from heavy introspection to crystalline release. No elision issues; diction biased toward cartomancer's mystical lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, with varied rhythm supporting lyric build; opening figurative density ("choking beauty...noose") purposeful but borders overwrought. No loops or artifacts; closure lines crisp ("reminder—of time’s fragility"). Minor register elevation in peak visions caps band.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fantasy premise ingeniously synthesizes cartomancy relic with cloud glade for fresh repentance arc; saucer crack transforms trope into irreplaceable closure pivot. Risky lyric compression feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening emotional specificity.</comment>
