<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear via duty to preserve wisdom, but "strangely honest" trait is label-only without constraining a contradictory impulse or visible tradeoff in pivotal consecration; interiority concrete yet lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. Final fulfillment feels credible endurance but not deeply earned through prior micro-choices showing internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers and ritual builds to Charged Poise closure with prophet's arrival reconfiguring preservation stake; orientation anchored early (pavilion, dunes). One tightening via consecration awakening clearings; cost felt in impending change versus solace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dunes, pulsing parapet, and silken pavilion constrain ritual and charge final glowing walls/whispers image; sensory details (hum, sand shifting, thickening air) selective via POV bias toward echoes. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wisdom pre-prophet) signaled early, tightens via consecration narrowing vanishing risk; under Accumulative lens, density cadence reweights with felt solace cost. Mild escalation lacks agency-driven reversal foreclosing live option beyond ritual completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation amid change emerges organically from ritual and enduring whispers; final image offers resonant non-literal answer (echo guides future) reweighting prior duty without moralizing. Subtext in half-mask hiding emotion adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, whisper focus); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with ritual intensity. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in consecration; minor paraphrase loops ("strangely honest," whisper repetitions) and faint purple ("fabric of time paused") dull peak slightly but don't obscure closure. No heavy artifacts or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (prophet, ancient artifacts) transformed via kinetic/pulsing specifics and line-walker peripheral sense; fresh synthesis in whisperfield calm charging preservation poise. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
