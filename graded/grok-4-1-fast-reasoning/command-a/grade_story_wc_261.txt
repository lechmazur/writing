<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation as closure seeker intensifies via plant urgency and tunnel visions, compelling descent with embodied warmth/heart quicken; internal conflict in memory fragments shows contradictory past selves, but cavern epiphany feels slightly unearned without stronger simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as whispers/coffee rings/hourglass accumulate to tunnel deepening and cavern RR via sand merger with felt scar-healing cost; orientation anchored early in tower; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frosted hourglass and ivy recur to constrain guidance/choice, charging final merger image; cavern crystals pulse tactilely, mirroring heartbeat resolution without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake to restore miracle tightens accumulatively via urgent plant voices narrowing to tunnel risks and hourglass placement; agency in descent/placement forecloses doubt with wound-opening cost legible in fading scars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scars-as-stories theme emerges organically from visions/merger, reweighting closure-seeking without moralizing; final endless sand flow resonates as non-literal answer to displaced miracle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in plant telepathy and scar-pattern reading; rhythmic modulation builds from hush to chorus without distance slips or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor loops in "whispers grew louder" and warmth repetition dull propulsion slightly; high density integrates sensory specifics, but dense metaphors like "meteor hush" border overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Telepathic plants guiding scar-reading to hourglass miracle synthesizes fresh fantasy angle; tunnel visions transform tropes via personal amnesia without derivative echoes.</comment>
