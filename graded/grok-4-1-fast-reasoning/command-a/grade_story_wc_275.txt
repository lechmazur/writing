<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's pacifist traits drive internal conflict peaking in blade hesitation, with embodied reluctance ("its weight unfamiliar") earning her endurance; Kael applies targeted pressure without diluting her arc. Minor slips in stock phrasing like "heart tightened" prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from warning to fortification, delivering Charged Poise closure in final image where legacy reconfigures with felt cost of refusal to abandon; orientation anchored in first paragraph, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert contrast constrain choices (fortification), with sandbag scrap as recurring tool charging resilience image; sensory details (scent, petals) selective and POV-filtered through nurturing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve farm peace) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via blade acceptance narrowing pacifist options with visible cost; agency in refusal and fortification coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-chaos emerges organically from nurturing acts and final image reweighting father's legacy without statement; desert roses shift from sanctuary to active symbol, inviting ambiguity on violence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (plant-heartbeat feel) and natural dialogue subtext ("I won’t use it unless I have to"); rhythmic modulation under threat pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("desert rose," "continuity through chaos") dull density slightly (−0.4), but propulsion strong and rhythm varies; no closure artifacts, vivid specificity in "delicate petals a stark contrast."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tower pacifist farm with airship scrap transforming tropes; quiet blade renunciation risks bold Charged Poise, feeling inevitable from particulars.</comment>
