<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied traits like "walks backwards when nervous" and "combative tenderness warring with the fragility" reveal character under task pressure; final resolve from nervousness feels earned via prior scars and micro-choices in annotation. Minor slip in reflective drift to mentees ("faces blurring") abstracts internal conflict rather than dramatizing simultaneous impulses in pivotal annotation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup (task/mirror) to closure RR (Charged Poise: mirror as "portal," steady walk reconfiguring exile promise); orientation anchored early ("forgotten library," Elara's desk). One tightening via shimmering shadow response makes before/after legible with felt resolve cost in final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration ("aged paper and damp wood," "shelves groaning") filters through Elara's priorities, constraining solitary task; shard-mirror as recurring micro-setting charges final image ("no longer...a prison but a portal"). No slips; environment subtly mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (annotate shadow for reversible exile) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tea-leaf deepening that narrows to successful shimmer; agency in tracing leaves forces trade-off (nervousness endured). Cost legible in "breath shallow" to "quiet resolve," charging closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resilience emerges organically from annotation process and shadow's softening, with final image ("shadow a bridge between worlds") offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting exile premise. Subtext in leaf patterns and backwards walk avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in her scars' oblique cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (tea leaves as "crescent moon," shadows "mock[ing]"); rhythmic prose modulates from tense ("trembled") to poised closure. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly in shimmer beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("steam curling like whispers," varying rhythms); minor paraphrase loops in shadow/silence motifs ("hush...haunting and serene," "silence louder than any scream") slightly dull mid-beat without obscuring closure image. No major artifacts; figurative coherence holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea-leaf geometry annotating trapped shadow transforms relic-trope into organic drive; risk in unorthodox method heightens stakes uniquely. Core premise (reversible exile via quiet mentorship) feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding templates through lived particulars.</comment>
