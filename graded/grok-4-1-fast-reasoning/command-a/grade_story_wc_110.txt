<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to thaw mistrust is embodied in her racing heart and finger-tracing, with contradictory risk in "honesty felt like a risky bridge"; final gesture earned by building interior pressure. Minor weakness in reflective summaries like "tales of trust broken and rebuilt" that verge on stock phrasing without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with symbol density tightening to Charged Poise closure in Kian's lens-holding and unguarded words, reconfiguring mistrust with relational cost legible in "heavy with unspoken questions." Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening via decision to sketch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystals' hum, petrichor, and post-rain damp constrain and mirror choices, charging final warming glow; recurring lens as micro-setting enables gesture. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (Elara notices symbolic whispers under solitude).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via symbol buildup to agency in sliding paper/lens, narrowing options with felt rejection risk in "heart raced" and heavy air before reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous honesty emerges organically from doodles/lens/ticket evolving to bridge mistrust, resonant in final image without moralizing; subtext in gesture's silence answers relational question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (symbols as heart-language); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Even broken, it shows us something true"), advances closure. Rhythmic texture modulates from hush to warming glow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "tracing the doodles" and "whispered" repetitions dull density slightly; strong propulsion otherwise, with varied rhythm supporting accumulative build to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystal-whisper setting and doodle/lens as trust language transforms workplace mistrust trope; risk in symbolic gesture heightens stakes organically.</comment>
