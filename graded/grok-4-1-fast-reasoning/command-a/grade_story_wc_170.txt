<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via sacrifice of pulse into melody; strength in earned change with fainter heartbeat. Weakness in limited contradictory impulses—calm dominates without embodied conflict in resistance beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build across notes to surrender; closure as Charged Poise in "mirrors stabilized" with legible cost ("heartbeat now fainter, borrowed and shared too many times"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via resistance/surrender.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet after rain recurs to charge final shimmer image, constraining perch and post-rain visuals that enable spectrum/mirages. Sensory hierarchy vivid and purposeful, filtered through artist's eyes; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively via mirror resistance forcing louder song and pulse sacrifice; agency in "sang louder" forecloses easy success. Cost unmistakable in trembling hands and fainter heartbeat charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy's cost emerges organically from borrowed pulse to possibilities; final terrace sanctuary image reweights reflection-to-possibility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in artistic noticing (e.g., "sunlight fractured through the wet glass"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in figurative density during notes without muddle, but "perceptively calm" repetition borders template phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism in song-coded illusions and heartbeat sacrifice transforms mirror trope; risk in abstract art-as-empathy pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
