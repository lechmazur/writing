<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic perception provides concrete, character-specific interiority that embodies emotion and motivation; personal village backstory anchors the vow without flattening pressure. Final unfettering of fears shows earned change with cost, though internal contradictions act mildly rather than simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure in the hush's materialization and cavern's exhale; orientation anchors immediately in first paragraph. "She had succeeded" line delivers legible conceptual cost of unfettered fears with before/after reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice cavern's crystalline walls and stalactites constrain the synesthetic ringing, with aurora as conduit charging the climax; sensory details filter through Elara's bias, mirroring internal states. Final softening walls evolve causally, recharging the setting in closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unfetter wonder signaled early and tightens via chisel-moment timing into agency-driven ringing; accumulative escalation peaks in hush's embodiment. Cost legible in personal fears overcome, though no secondary loss alters tactics mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in stillness emerges organically from synesthetic particulars and hush's living form; final exhale image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting silence as possibility. No moralizing, with ambiguity in "quiet triumph."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature modulates rhythmically under climax pressure; POV stable and biased toward colors/notes. Compression in bell-ringing builds texture without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion, but figurative language in most climax sentences ("painting the cavern in hues of emerald and sapphire") borders overwriting without harm to closure. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies with scene cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic prism-song premise synthesizes fresh world-logic with theme of stillness-as-potential; risk-taking in accumulative lyric form heightens closure without gimmickry. "Sculpted hush" as living silence transforms tropes inevitably.</comment>
