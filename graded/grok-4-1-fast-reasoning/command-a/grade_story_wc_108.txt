<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via seashell-cast-key-door progression to RR closure; mirrors shattering reconfigures identity with legible emotional cost in final step forward. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Betrayal theme emerges organically from notes/seashell/voice, reweighted in "You are what you choose" without moralizing; mirrors crack as resonant non-literal answer to vulnerability question.</comment>
