<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between scholarly knowledge and lingering fears, embodied in quill's crystallization and breath-holding micro-choice; final endurance earned with scars reframed as "symbols of her journey." Minor slip in abstract motivation phrasing ("transform scars into stories") lacks one embodied contradiction under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from quill shimmer to breath climax, delivering Charged Poise closure where quill smooths and platform becomes "sanctuary," with legible emotional cost in fear confrontation. Single tightening via superstition revisit narrows options; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Platform sways "in sync with her thoughts," constraining focus and charging final image as "sanctuary"; sensory hush, mist, rain mirror internal states purposefully without catalog. Selective details like steam mingling evoke renewal without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome stress/fears for calm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via crystallization forcing breath-deepening; agency in revisiting superstitions forecloses fear-path with felt cost in heartbeat rhythm. Minor abstractness in stakes prevents peak legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via "breath between storms" emerges organically from quill/storm parallels, resonant in final "world cleansed and renewed" without moralizing. Scars motif reweights from burden to "chapter in the story," tying arc inextricably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature in nature-attuned noticing (rain tap, steam curl); rhythmic modulation under stress coherent, no head-hopping. Minor register elevation ("elastic, stretching and contracting") fits lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm; purposeful metaphors like "frost on a winter morning" support atmosphere without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening ("saturated hush... pause between storms") risks paraphrase feel but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune quill, floating platform tea rite, and superstition revisit transforms self-doubt trope into rune-carved scars' evolution. Risky lyric fantasy frame coheres without gimmick, premise implications fully committed.</comment>
