<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in family betrayal compels choices like approaching the fortune-teller and men, with micro-choices revealing values; embodied determination shines in steady voice during confrontation. Interior conflict subtle but present in "comforting unease." Final guardianship feels earned without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fob clue → fortune-teller → necklace lead → confrontation tightens stakes. Orientation anchored early (market, Lila's quest by para 2). Closure as CR via final fob clutch reconfigures trust with conceptual fragility cost legible in "crack in the foundation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (salt/decay, whispers) filters through Lila's priorities, guiding path to booths/men; rotting pier recurs to charge dawn-edge image, constraining isolation. Atmosphere tensions "truce of hush" without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust via truth) signaled early, causal escalation narrows via clues to verbal showdown foreclosing violence path. Confrontation agency (words/wit) tests commitment with men’s tension; cost felt in fraying hush and fragile truce.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of fragile trust emerges organically from fob taunt, vague oracle, verbal thwart; final image non-literally answers "sound of trust breaking" via quiet crack, reweighting hush's premise with ambiguity. Subtext in smiles/lies enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (reading silences); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Just a conversation"), distinct from narration/men’s sneers. Voice texture modulates tension via short urgent lines in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels (varied openings, para breaths); high density in market weave, minimal loops despite fob echoes. Minor paraphrase in unease phrasing (-0.3) but no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: verbal "rewriting rules" in pirate hush world transforms tropes; confrontation turn from heirloom taunt to weapon feels inevitable. Risky quiet thwart heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
