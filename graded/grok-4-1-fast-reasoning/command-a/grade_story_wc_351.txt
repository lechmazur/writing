<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Traits like methodical chaos shown in tracing shards and risky modification; earned shift to determination at "quaking reverie...stilled" with felt cost of confronting ghosts. Minor label-speak ("chaotically precise") undramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories and canyon animation builds to Charged Poise CR in mirror shimmer and vow ("no matter the cost"), reconfiguring her role with conceptual price of entanglements confronted on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and jagged mirror shards constrain hands-on work and charge final image of stars seeming closer; sensory whispers/shadows mirror internal reverie purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting dreams via memory bridge signaled early; accumulative deepening from personal repair to defiant collective act narrows to purpose realization with mind-risk cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of piecing abandoned ambitions emerges via mirror motif shifting from fracture to portal; final faces/vow offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with engineering-perceptual signature ("unraveling the puzzle"); lyrical rhythm modulates uncertainty to resolve, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels reflection; minor figurative pile-up ("vines...entangled...shards...reassembled") in mid-beats borders coherence slip but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synaptic plasticity imprinting dreams onto relic transforms abandonment trope; risk in mind-unraveling modification heightens stakes organically.</comment>
