<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in deliberation drives choices like returning to the workshop, with embodied resonance ("fingers brushed... felt a faint resonance") revealing character under pressure; no deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits depth, but final restoration earns closure without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore linkages (relearns runes → key glows brighter → activates at noon → shadows absorbed); Decisive Change closure lands on-page with legible cost in deliberate process and dormant key; orientation anchored early ("nocturnal observatory on a floating isle"); one meaningful tightening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating isle setting pressures via straining tethers and drifting low, constraining awakening timing; sensory details like "runes pulsed faintly under moonlight" and "air thinner" filter through scholar's priorities, evolving causally to charge edge precipice climax; micro-object (key) integrates as recurring constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control awakening/solve shadow mystery) signaled early, tightens causally when relearning enables noon activation amid straining tethers; agency in deliberate loops forecloses rushed mistakes with felt effort cost; pressure coheres to DC without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of restoring lost knowledge through deliberate closure emerges organically from rune relearning and shadow revelation, with final "ready to face whatever came next" offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting past loops; no moralizing, ambiguity in ongoing mysteries lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with scholar-specific perceptual bias ("runes... like echoes of a forgotten song"); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet study to surging energy at void; no dialogue, but diction purposeful and consistent in fantasy register without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with lines like "runes began to return... each symbol etched... felt more familiar" advancing action and interiority; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; clean syntax propels to closure without overwriting in peak "surge of energy ripple."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune quest with "shadows at noon" void and "spoons bent reality" relic transforms fantasy tropes via deliberate loops; core premise commits to awakening rules without retreat, risk in quiet escalation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
