<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via embodied weariness and ritual commitment, with micro-choices like pausing before the mask revealing values; internal conflict emerges in heart's weight versus deliberate grace, but lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax ash-scattering beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via atmospheric density and holds to Charged Poise closure in final paragraph's ash-settling benediction with felt emotional cost; single continuous scene oriented by ~50 words, one tightening as chair slows signaling ritual imminence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (echoing footsteps, creaking chair, jagged mask edges) filtered through Elara's bias toward fragility, subtly guiding ritual by converging art/memory; recurring mask charges final image, constraining her reflection on wholeness in shattering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to honor via scattering signaled early, escalates accumulatively as chair slows narrowing to act with deepening emotional density; agency in powdering ash forecloses inaction with felt heart-weight cost legible in closure realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Impermanence theme emerges organically from ash ritual, mask, and gallery whispers, reweighted non-literally in ending's crystallized truth amid mirage acceptance; resonant final image offers ambiguous lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of broken-beauty fixation; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, diction purposeful and biased without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "mirage of safety" and impermanence phrasing in reflections) and synonym churn around "fleeting"/"fragility" dull peak ritual slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh ash-scattering ritual synthesizes grief/art/impermanence organically; porcelain mask's jagged beauty transforms fragility trope, with bold lyric risk heightening closure resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
