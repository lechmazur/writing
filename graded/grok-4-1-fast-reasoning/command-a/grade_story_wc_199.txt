<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in folklore belief intensifies credibly through speck discovery, with embodied actions like sorting and building revealing traits under curiosity pressure. Internal change to guardian feels earned via accumulation, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal beats like the altar scene. Smooth progression without deep flaws or visible cost in refusal/endurance limits to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed sorting to monument-building to research, tightening via speck's glow and whispers into CR closure ("something had shifted forever") with conceptual cost of identity reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early in arbor work; shards (day/night/archives) taught via routine without disorientation. Minor summary in "days turned into weeks" doesn't break causality or closure legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of ancient wood" and falling leaves selectively filter through Elara's sorter priorities, constraining choices in sorting/prodding/building. Arbor's ashen sky and leaves mirror internal shift, charging final image without overt symbolism. Recurring seeds constrain actions and evolve with events; spatial coherence in fire/altar scene strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose via leaf prophecies) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through speck warmth/glow/presence, narrowing from sorter duty to guardian role with agency in pouching/building/research. One deepening sufficient: whispers force stance crystallization. Cost legible in "shifted forever"; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of magic in small things emerges organically from particulars like speck and monuments, reweighted in final image of blossoming purpose without moralizing. Subtext in leaf whispers and transformation invites ambiguity on prophecy reality. Protagonist arc inextricable from "bridge between past and future"; resonant non-literal closure answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in seed/leaf attention; voice texture poetic yet grounded ("calloused yet gentle hands"). Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in ending; no dialogue, no head-hopping. Diction matches sorter idiom without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwriting in stacked modifiers ("mossy delight that tinged") during low-pressure opener, not closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling inciting prod or final image; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore arbor-world with speck-monuments transforms discovery trope via lived sorter details. Risky poetic conceit ("hush where past meets prophecy") heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable premise angle on hidden magic; no derivative echoes.</comment>
