<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in guilt clear and intensifies via king-pawn parallel, compelling entry; embodied fidgeting reveals character under pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—interior conflict summarized rather than dramatized in pivotal decoding beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure at platinum thread pull ("Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey"), reweighting guilt with felt emotional cost; invitation shift after tapestry tightens meaningfully. Orientation anchored early in village/labyrinth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth and tapestry constrain choices (decoding invites entry), chess piece as micro-setting charges final talisman image; sensory details (shimmering walls, cool air) selective via POV urgency. Evolving thunder mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tapestry parallel narrowing to resolve/renunciation; cost legible in tears and lifted weight at climax. Agency in winnowing/pulling forecloses self-blame path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as journey emerges organically from king parallel and thread message, resonant non-literal CR reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "road ahead would be long."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (chess precision in patterns/noticing); poetic diction/rhythm modulates from tense to serene, consistent under realization pressure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in fidgeting/frayed threads descriptions dull mid-section density; overwriting with stacked metaphors ("woven hush," "frayed soul") in decoding beat risks coherence without payoff. Strong propulsion overall, varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess tutor decoding soul-labyrinth transforms redemption trope via tactile threads/parallel; risk in accumulative poetic structure heightens internal stakes organically.</comment>
