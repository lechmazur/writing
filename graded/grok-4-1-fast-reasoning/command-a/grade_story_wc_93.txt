<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving rock placement and dust scattering; interior visions embodied but epiphany in "In that instant, Kael understood" borders unearned without deeper contradiction. Flaws like sanity edge balance competence. Micro-choices reveal values under ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rock sequence to eel harmony and dust glow, yielding CR closure in realization with felt sanity/journey cost. Orientation anchored early ("tidal bluff," "Kael, eel herder"). One tightening via curse flare suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora and bluff constrain ritual (rocks along edge, tides whisper secrets), charging final shifted pattern image; sensory vivid/selective (glinting eels, trembling bluff). Mirrors internal flow without overt symbolism. Recurrent aurora/eels evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand patterns) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sequence unlock and dust surge, forcing realization agency; cost legible in traded eel backstory and ongoing quest. Eel harmony deepens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected patterns emerges organically via eels/rocks/stars, resonant in CR "all things were connected"; final rock shift reweights without moralizing. Minor platitude risk in eternal patterns but grounded in ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (pattern focus, vision fragments); rhythmic prose modulates to intensity at dust scatter. No head-hopping; diction purposeful (auroral colors shift with action).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors coherent/purposeful (aurora "tendrils freezing") without muddle in peak dust beat. Minor overwriting in openings but no loops/scaffold; propulsion strong to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of precog curse, eel ritual, math sequences transforms mystic trope; star dust/rock pattern turn inevitable from setup. Bold fantasy committed fully without retreat.</comment>
