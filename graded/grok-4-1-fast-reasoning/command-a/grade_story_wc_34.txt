<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation via kinship with voiceless ghost drives encoding choices to earned realization of her power; interiority concrete in heart racing and intuition during climax. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from tuning lute to final thunderclap; RR closure in ghost's manifestation, touch, and dissolution ("their hands touched, a connection that transcended worlds") with conceptual cost of fleeting freedom legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm elements (lightning splits sky, thunderclap) and bolt plate constrain timing/encoding choice, charging final image; sensory details (mist, graffiti shifting) filtered through Elara's attunement, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to free ghost signaled early, tightens via "timeframe... between lightning and thunder" narrowing options in swift encoding; agency and felt cost in ghost's scattering after connection under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of voicing the unseen emerges organically from graffiti messages, encoding melody, and final stardust dissolution; resonant non-literal answer in Elara's realization without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature of poetic attunement ("whispers of the storm"); rhythmic syntax modulates from soft haunting to rising harmony under storm pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyrical rhythm varying sentence openings; minor descriptive repetition (ghost presence) contained, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptographer-balladeer freeing digital ghost via steampunk bolt plate transforms tropes organically; risk in ethereal climax heightens stakes with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
