<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism wars concretely with curiosity when kneeling for the shell, driving micro-choices like lifting it despite hesitation. Internal conflict shows in resisting then yielding to memories, embodied in racing heart. Figure's mirror-face pierces effectively, but some diagnostic labels like "unwilling archivist" slightly undercut embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/emotional density builds from shell's hum to memory flood and tapestry-weaving CR, with cost in skepticism's transformation legible in final orchid dimming. Orientation anchored immediately in garden at twilight. Single-shard visionary transition legible, closure reconfigures isolation with undeniable internal price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet garden's jasmine scent, rustling leaves, and shifting orchid hues selectively narrow to shell and fountain, mirroring Elara's emotional shift and constraining her kneel/lift. Twilight-to-morning evolution causal with events (blurring, fading star). Recurring orchid charges final image, filtering through skeptic's biased eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. mystery's pull) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hum's intensification and memory flood forcing non-resistance. Agency in yielding transforms isolation, with felt cost in "heart pierced" and foreclosed doubt. One deepening suffices, charging closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation/transformation emerges organically from shell's feelings-to-tapestry shift, child's laughter to melody reweighting particulars. Final image answers isolation-independence without stating moral. Figure's speech borders overt but subtext in weaving carries resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: skeptic notices "whispers dismissed as folklore," opens to resonance. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating from descriptive to immersive in visionary space. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual in figure's "turn strength into independence."</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.6<comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, short sentences in flood ("heart raced"). Some overwriting in stacked metaphors ("tragically radiant orchid," "velvet petals dissolving") dulls peak density slightly. No loops or scaffolds; vivid specificity propels, but minor register elevation jars in skeptic's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shell as memory-key in transformative garden twists epiphany trope via resonance-weaving. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in charged poise closure. No derivatives; particulars like quarantined memories feel inevitable hindsight.</comment>
