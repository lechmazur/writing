<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via feather texture memory and surge of power; contradictory impulses (nightly escape vs. confrontation) act in scene, earning wholeness. Minor slip in overt epiphany phrasing ("Home was not a place but a state") borders diagnostic but ties to prior pain. Final choice credible under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from wandering to stone-seeding to bookstore shift and CR closure ("shape of home" repriced as internal harmony with pain as catalyst). Orientation anchored early; surreal rearrangement motivated by her actions. Cost legible in "pain of remembering...catalyst" at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves and stained-glass filter through her fluid perception, constraining path until final clearing charges image. Feather texture as micro-setting guides key choice. Sensory selection purposeful, mirroring internal fragmentation to wholeness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand home/confront buried self) signaled early, tightens via stone interaction forcing trade-off (pain vs. power). Agency in seeding thoughts narrows options; cost felt in storm break. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of internal harmony emerges organically from stone mirror and feather conduit, reweighting "home" in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity in "quiet strength" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (shifting light/symbols mirroring fluidity). Lyrical rhythm modulates from charged air to light heart; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic propulsion in peak ("symbols began to glow...air crackled"); varied syntax supports surge. Minor artifacts: paraphrase loops on "buried talents" and "hidden thunder" repeat dull mid-section slightly (−0.4). Density high overall, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer/reality-substitution with feather-texture seeding transforms escape trope into reclamation. Risky surreal shift from maze to path feels earned, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
