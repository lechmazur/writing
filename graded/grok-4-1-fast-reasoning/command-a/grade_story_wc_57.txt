<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation clear and consistent in preserving knowledge, but interiority relies on labels like "infinitely patient" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; epiphany at "Slowly, the pattern began to make sense" feels unearned without prior internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("The ancient methods were safe"), oriented early on dock/harbor; lacks tightening beyond gradual realization, but cost felt in purpose surge without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (snow-muffled planks, fog hush, fulgurite hum) mirrors internal states and constrains decoding; golden dock and rope evolve tactilely through action, charging final image without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode knots) signaled but static, with minimal escalation—one mild deepening in spiral knot alignment; no on-page reversal or visible cost foreclosing options, pressure remains observational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving "seeds of ideas" emerges organically from particulars like knots/glass mirroring; final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, though ambiguity lacks complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias (pattern-logic in chaos); rhythmic prose modulates poetically, diction character-specific to philosophical lens, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyrical rhythm varies but paraphrase loops ("fog thickened... oceanic hush deepened," hush/whisper repetition) dull density in high-revelation beats; overwriting in stacked descriptors like "fractal patterns mirroring the knots" borders muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knots as encoded wisdom with fulgurite fractal echo transforms trope of lost knowledge; risk in lyric Accumulative drive pays off in quiet CR without gimmickry.</comment>
