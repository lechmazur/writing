<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to prove coincidences' meaning drives consistent traits and intensifies through star-tracking to memory sacrifice, with embodied hesitation ("She hesitated, her mind flashing back") earning the final renunciation. Internal conflict and contradictory impulses (hope vs. pain of loss) act simultaneously in the ritual beat. Flawless single-POV execution with micro-choices revealing values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from star-plotting to ritual, culminating in on-page RR (prism reforms) with legible cost ("her memories began to fade"). Orientation anchored early ("glass humming pavilion... edge of... city"). One meaningful tightening at partial alignment ("the shard seemed to pulse") narrows to sacrifice; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavilion's hum and telescope constrain choices (star-tracking, observation), charging final image as melody vibrates walls. Sensory details selective/POV-biased (custodian notices dust on relics, star fractures). Post-collapse specificity mirrors internal hope without overt symbolism; spatial choreography coherent across spiral stairs to deck.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend prism/prove meaning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failed alignment forcing ritual trade-off. Agency in endurance (refuses to quit) and sacrifice forecloses memory path with on-page cost. Escalation coheres under lens; partial pulse beat narrows options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of patterned meaning emerges organically from star alignments and sacrifice, resonating in final "web of meaning" image without statement. Subtext in memory loss reweights coincidences as costly threads; ambiguity lingers in transformed sorrow. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern-seeking: stars mirror fractures). Prose texture poetic yet controlled ("thistle-blown hope" motif taught early), modulating rhythm with intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits custodian's hopeful idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor overwriting in peak ritual ("wave of warmth... memories began to fade" borders purple). Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops or scaffolds, though "hum" motif repeats without templating. Minor register elevation ("intricate patterns") in close doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse relic-mending via stars/memory sacrifice transforms coincidence trope into pattern-web CR. Risk in ritual cost heightens stakes organically; no derivative templates, voice commits to idiosyncratic hope amid chaos.</comment>
