<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mentor's ambiguous loss drives consistent choices like pocketing eyes and decoding, culminating in earned harmony realization. Interiority concrete in sensing eyes' watchfulness and tree's pull, but occasional diagnostic phrasing like "mathematics of emotion" borders on abstract. Final determination despite warning shows contradictory optimism under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (eyes, shadows, journal) build density to CR closure where harmony reweights chaos with mentor's peril as felt cost—"ready to share... orchard seemed to glow brighter." Orientation anchored early in cavern orchard; no shards or ambiguity issues. Cost legible in final image tying risk to promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like stalactite drip and shimmering fruit filter through Elara's priorities, guiding discoveries; orchard constrains via specific trees/stones charging final glow image. Mosaic patterns and warmth integrate into action without stalls. Spatial choreography clear across orchard/workshop moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher emotion math amid loss) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative density of code/journal/warning to breakthrough tightening options from peril to harmony. Agency in magic focus and dovetailing research; warning forces trade-off endurance with visible risk cost. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony over emotional control emerges organically from particulars like eyes' shadows mirroring mosaics and mentor's failure, reweighted in final orchard glow without statement. Subtext in peril symbols enriches ambiguity of loss; no moralizing, invites reflection on buried optimism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in magical noticing (eyes "watching," tree "calling"); voice modulates rhythmically from hypothesis to breakthrough. Prose texture purposeful with inventive diction like "dovetailed into a theory." No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with lines advancing insight (e.g., shadows mimicking mosaic perfectly); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds despite pattern recurrence. Minor register elevation in "mathematics of emotion" but voice-consistent. Clean syntax, zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermist eyes as emotional decoder in cavern orchard transforms loss tropes via math-emotion premise; risk in tampering feels organic. Final glow reconfigures silence to promise inevitably from particulars. Bold magical realism angle elevates ingenuity.</comment>
