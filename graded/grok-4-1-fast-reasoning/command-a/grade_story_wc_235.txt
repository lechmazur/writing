<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction via jealousy of past selves acting in dream dialogue, earning shift to gratitude with embodied tremble and weight-lift cost. Minor slip in stock epiphany phrasing ("continuum") but prior causality holds. Past selves' voices distinguish without convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to CR closure via scroll's "The story is not in the past or future—it is now," reweighting premise with emotional cost legible in fog-lift image. One tightening in dream drift suffices; orientation anchored early in cabin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (pine-scented walls, birch bark glow) filter through dream-chronicler bias, constraining choice via scroll pulse and charging final writing image. Mountains hum mirrors internal resolution without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (scroll as tool) qualifies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos) signaled early, escalates via dream deepening under Accumulative lens, narrowing to renunciation of envy with felt emotional cost in "feral nostalgia lifting." Agency in closing eyes forces crystallization; one turn sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-continuum emerges organically from jealousy conflict and scroll CR, offering non-literal answer in final writing beat that reweights past selves without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like grave inscription avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in dream imagery (amber-violet sky); voice modulates rhythmically from turmoil to poise. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, pursuing revelation. No head-hopping; elision of dream mechanics taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm, but minor overwrite in peak dream ("shattered mirror, each piece reflecting") risks muddle without payoff; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Varied syntax propels to final hum image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream chronicler premise with self-grave trigger transforms nostalgia trope via scroll map; risk in nonlinear dream pays off in CR without gimmick. Ingenuity in shifting markings feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
