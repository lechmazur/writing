<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Solid interiority via failures and resolve hardening, but epiphany at "the penny drop" feels slightly unearned without more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; stoically sensitive traits emerge in tremor amid chant but lack deeper embodied tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of failures building to CR closure via sapling emergence; on-page cost legible in "letting go of what once was" reconfiguring resurrection goal; orientation anchored early in nexus description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ember nexus and crozier constrain choices (sinking tip triggers growth); sensory ash/scent/twilight selective and POV-filtered; frozen bloom image charges final resilience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interrupt destiny via vivify) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through failures to chant/sapling; agency in pressing crozier forecloses old path with felt cost of transformed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges organically from failures/ashes to sapling; final image of crozier-as-seed offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias (alchemical priorities in symbols/ashes); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from heavy air to pulsing energy, fitting accumulative texture; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short chant sentences propel climax); minor density slips in adjacent failure summaries ("ashes" echoes purposeful but borders loop); no closure-touching artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical failure into crozier-catalyzed growth transforms redemption trope; risk in redefining vivify as awakening dormant feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
