<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to shape loss into art intensifies through carving challenges like the mane, with embodied emotions (tea grounding her); minor diagnostic phrasing ("harvest lessons from loss") slightly abstracts interiority without full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as carving density and reflection build to Charged Poise closure in final holding of lion, reconfiguring grief with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent, no micro turns needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and tools constrain carving choices and charge diffused light in final image; sensory details (drip, steam, wood grain) selective via POV grief bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of processing grief tightens via mane challenge under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance with felt cost in acceptance; agency in persistent carving forecloses unprocessed sorrow path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Here and gone" emerges organically from carving impermanence and Marius memories, resonant CR in lion's form reweighting loss without moralizing; ambiguity in grief's embrace invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in rust-hued, tactile noticing (wood contours, steam curl); stable single POV with voice modulating carving intensity, no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on loft quietude and "seemed" constructions across paragraphs dull propulsion (−0.6); figurative density high in carving beats without payoff (whispering wood, crystallized time), mixed vehicles reduce clarity; rhythm varies but repetitive stems ("She rose," "She returned").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion carving as grief vessel transforms widow trope via specific ash wood and "here and gone" lens; risks lyric reflection but stays grounded, no close famous echoes.</comment>
