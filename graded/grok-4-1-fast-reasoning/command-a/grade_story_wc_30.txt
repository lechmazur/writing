<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve wonder drives meticulous actions like incantation; interiority concrete in identity musings. Realization earned via embodied ritual, but slight over-articulation of beliefs ("she had always known") borders on summary. Contradictory impulses in accepting change act in final ledger close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from chaos to rune reconfiguration as CR closure. Orientation anchored early in atrium duties. Whisper and orb dissolve provide tightening with conceptual cost in non-original stabilization legible at "not a failure but a transformation".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal pool constrains ritual (hand dip, orb dissolve) and charges final rune settlement. Sensory details (shimmering floor, cool silvery surface) filtered through Elara's priorities, vivid and purposeful. Runes evolve causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of identity chaos signaled early; orb ritual deepens pressure under accumulative lens, narrowing to acceptance. Agency in incantation forecloses restoration with transformation cost. No reversal needed; cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fluid identity theme emerges from migrating chaos and ritual; final image of empty creel reweights premise organically. Whisper integrates contradictions without moralizing. Minor friction: realization line echoes thesis slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical texture with wonder-biased perception distinct; syntax modulates serenity amid chaos. Stable close third-person, no elision issues. Rhythmic control heightens ritual immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, thought without loops; varied rhythm propels to closure. Figurative language purposeful (e.g., "tapestry of opposing threads"), no muddle in peak orb beat. Concise, no scaffolds dulling rune payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal magic, identity flux, creel artifact transforms tropes organically. Risky poetic fantasy commits fully; final "after tomorrow disappeared" inflects inevitable shift. No derivative echoes.</comment>
