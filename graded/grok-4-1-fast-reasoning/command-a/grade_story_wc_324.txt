<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied curiosity and micro-choices like pressing the aid to her ear propel motivation, earning her resolve at closure. Minor slip in generic phrasing like "heart quickened" slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pulses and mist density build to CR closure in the warm photograph and ongoing quest, with felt conceptual cost of perpetual work. Orientation anchored early in atrium; one tightening at stronger pulses narrows path cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist constrains choices by thickening and parting, charging final image as sanctuary; pulses as micro-setting guide search tactilely. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect voice tightens accumulatively via clearer whispers and parting mist, forcing endurance with cost in fading pulses and perpetual quest. Agency in tracking forecloses ignorance path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of preserving faint stories emerges organically from pulses to warm photo reprise, resonating without moralizing in final hush companion image. Incidental heroism reweights Elara's arc non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward faint sounds and mist; rhythmic prose like "mist swirled around her ankles" modulates tension distinctively. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops; rhythm varies for ear-test flow. Minor scaffold in repeated "mist" motif purposeful, not dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heart-tracer fantasy with hearing aid pulses transforms ghost story tropes into emotional preservation quest; risk in surreal pulses heightens stakes inevitably to warm photo CR.</comment>
