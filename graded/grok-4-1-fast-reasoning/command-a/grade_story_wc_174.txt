<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ethical exploration intensifies via doubts, with micro-choices like tracing the stick revealing values; interiority concrete but epiphany ("half-lit epiphanies") borders unearned summary over contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to CR closure in renewed purpose and departure, with cost legible in foreclosed old path; orientation anchored early in dome post-argument.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dome vividly mirrors turmoil ("silent witnesses"), constrains creation at center stage, charges final sanctuary image; tactile stick integrates purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant ethical stake signaled early tightens via sparked reversal idea, narrowing options with agency in puppet arrangement; cost felt in doubt's weight under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reversal/healing emerges implicitly from stick-tracing to rebuilt show, resonant in dawn departure without moralizing; final image reweights provocation-manipulation gray area.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with serene perceptual signature (contours, whispers); rhythmic texture modulates reflection, no head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("felt a sense," "peace settle") and repetitive "hush" across beats dull density; "meteor hush" strains coherence in key reflective lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher-puppeteer reversal in dome elevates ethical trope; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
