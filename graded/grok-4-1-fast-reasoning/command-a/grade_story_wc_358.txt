<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in survey actions, but interiority relies on labels like "rapidly adapting mind" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no on-page internal conflict complicates the realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with details building to CR closure ("hindsight was all she had now"); orientation anchored early, one tightening at wreckage discovery makes before/after legible with conceptual cost of fragility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Labyrinth setting constrains navigation and charges realization via funnel effect; sensory details (saltwater scent, creaks) selective and POV-filtered, mirroring silence's pressure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of surveying/predicting tightens accumulatively at aircraft discovery, narrowing to preventable failure; cost felt in "weight of her findings" forecloses prevention path under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of foresight's limits emerges organically from patch/wreckage convergence, reweighted in final image of silence as "echo of a failure"; no moralizing, resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with investigator's perceptual bias in details; rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("singular convergence," "rapidly adapting mind") and minor synonym churn dull density in reflective beats; strong propulsion overall, but artifacts cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of port labyrinth funneling plane crash transforms storm trope; patch as human relic adds ingenuity, but investigator realization feels familiar literary arc.</comment>
