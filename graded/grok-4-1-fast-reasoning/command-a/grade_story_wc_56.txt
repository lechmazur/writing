<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but lacks deep contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority concrete yet leans on summary ("Her motivation was clear"). Embodied emotion shows in "heart ached" upon reading confession, but no genuine flaws complicate choices with visible cost. Final stance feels earned but not through pivotal micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from atmospheric setup to CR closure via sundial glow and final image reconfiguring decay into possibility. Orientation anchored early ("twilight barge canal"). Cost legible in "weight of his words pressing down" and promised clarity; no reversals needed, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (damp earth scent, distant machinery hum) filtered through POV urgency; decaying barge constrains salvage choice. Recurring sundial charges final image ("journal in one hand and the sundial in the other"). Atmosphere evolves causally with dawn, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth via sundial) signaled early; accumulative deepening via journal discovery narrows to warning/message, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in deliberate salvage; cost felt in emotional ache and foreclosed uncertainty. Pressure coheres without reversal, fitting lens—one tightening charges Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging truth amid lies emerges organically from journal confession and sundial reconfiguration, avoiding statements. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("now felt alive with possibility"), reweighting prior decay. Subtext in "architecture of lies" enriches without moralizing; earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (instincts, silence as guides); diction/rhythm modulates from quiet buildup to charged dawn. No head-hopping or withholding; voice texture distinct in selective noticing ("footsteps echoed softly"). Prose reflects embodied state under subtle pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in stillness motifs ("world seemed to hold its breath," "holding its breath") dull density slightly. Some overwriting in descriptive stacks ("thick with the scent... faint hum"), yet integrated into action. No heavy artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-hunt trope via decaying canal and instinct-led salvage transforms into personal truth quest. Sundial/journal convergence feels inevitable from setup; risk in serene-to-charged tone shift heightens stakes organically. Memorable POV on forgotten waterways avoids generic mysticism.</comment>
