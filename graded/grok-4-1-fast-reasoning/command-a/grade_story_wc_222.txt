<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel chess sacrifices, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during game; resurfacing "sacredly playful nature" feels told rather than embodied in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore from ascent to chess climax; final queen swap delivers DC revealing lid's true purpose, with legible cost in prior sacrifices and journey risks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rediscovery of wonder emerges from quest particulars and game sacrifices; final image of lid in pocket reweights survival-to-playful arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of shadows, intuition, and logic; rhythmic prose modulates effectively during chess intensity, no elision issues.</comment>
