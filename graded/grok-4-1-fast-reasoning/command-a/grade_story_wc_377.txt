<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve wonder is clear and trait-rooted in bell tuning, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during pivotal carving; no micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure, making endurance declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening to sculpture spin as Charged Poise RR; cost of fleetingness legible in "this moment, like all moments of wonder, was fleeting," reconfiguring preservation on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment recurs as tool constraining carving choices and charging final dimming/wrapping image; bluff setting filters sensory priorities purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens via glistening density increase under accumulative lens, narrowing to harmony with cost of impermanence at climax motion; agency in creation forecloses permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in impermanence emerges organically from sculpture/symphony particulars; final descent reweights premise non-literally as journey without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature biased to harmony/whispers stable and rhythmic; diction modulates purposefully without leakage in single clean POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but minor "symphony of truth" repetition in climax borders motif without dulling; no scaffold obscures peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mute tuner, ice relic, kinetic harmony above clouds transforms vignette tropes organically; poetic risk heightens thematic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
