<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Minimal concrete interiority or contradictory impulses; Elara's resolve told abstractly without micro-choices under pressure until sudden climax handover; pretender's arc summarized via annotations rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with messages provoking responses to on-page DC closure via pellet drop and facade crack; orientation anchored early; montage summaries of days/nights dilute beat-by-beat pressure without breaking chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Selective details like "dust danced in beams" and humming stones build mystical atmosphere filtered through Elara; library books constrain message tactics; minor generic fantasy risks (crumbling tomes) without closure harm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant unmasking stake tightens causally via bolder messages and frantic replies, narrowing pretender's options; climax agency in pellet handover forces trade-off with legible exposure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rune shifts from deception to renewal reweights theme of truth's persistence organically; final Elara-alone image resonates without moralizing, tying to drift motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual bias toward library/symbols; rhythmic diction modulates elegantly; sparse dialogue carries defiance/subtext in "Write your truth."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm varies with scene poise, high density in key images; minor loops in "rune of drift"/"regally unpretentious" repeats and opening overwrites create template cadence without closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Message-in-books intrigue and pellet climax transform pretender trope ingeniously; fresh synthesis of library deception feels inevitable from rune buildup.</comment>
