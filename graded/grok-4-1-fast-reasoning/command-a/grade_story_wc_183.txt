<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to recapture self via garden is consistent and intensifies through memory blending, but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal reading beat; final wholeness feels earned yet smoothed without rawer embodied stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from card glow and thread-weaving to door; CR closure lands on-page as Elara steps through with card's dissolution as legible conceptual cost, one tightening via blended memories suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ship's labyrinth of mirrors and rusted machinery constrains path and mirrors internal aberration, fog thickest at bow charges mist-door image; sensory details like creaks and decay selectively heighten haunted tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to enter garden tightens accumulatively as threads deepen self-knowledge, agency in following glow and embracing aberration forces trade-off at Lyra's voice warning; cost felt in pause before threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of embracing flawed past emerges organically from aberrant ship lives blending into self-realization; final blooming names image offers resonant CR reweighting trapped freedom without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias toward anomalous; lyrical diction and rhythm modulate from hazy exploration to charged door moment, texture distinct yet controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose propels via varied rhythm in memory beats, high density weaves setting into action; minor stacked modifiers ("hazy embrace... groaning under weight") slightly blur early bow approach without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of carnival decay, memory-threads, and garden-as-state transforms lost-twin trope through aberrant weaving; fresh door of mist commits boldly to premise implications.</comment>
