<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in past shatter drives concrete actions like collecting absences, with embodied emotion in chest ache at climax; interiority particular via color-sounds but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for full 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds from color hums to forge vibration; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with "resonant ache" cost reconfiguring absences into wholeness, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like lavender hums and splintered hull filtered through POV bias constrain choices (shipwreck for absence) and charge final image (shipwrecks as monuments); 9+ test met with purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to recreate sound tightens accumulatively via collecting to imprinting, narrowing to emotional price; cost legible in trembling realization, driven by agency under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of shattering/trust as beauty emerges organically from particulars like absences into final reweighting; resonant non-literal answer in "quiet strength of memory," no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (colors as whispers/symphony); rhythmic prose modulates to intensity at forge, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful in sensory buildup without muddle in peak "hollow echo" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, absences, forge imprinting feels inevitable; surreal elements like color hums transform memory trope organically, risking bold conceit without gimmick.</comment>
