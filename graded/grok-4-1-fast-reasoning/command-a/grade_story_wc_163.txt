<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to find belonging's rhythm is consistent and anchors choices like sketching fireflies, but epiphany "belonging wasn’t about finding a place where you fit—it was about creating a rhythm" uses diagnostic summary without embodied contradiction, flattening internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with light patterns building density to Charged Poise closure in escape pod hesitation and final clutch of feather; alarms provide one tightening; cost legible in "she couldn’t stay, but... one last attempt," reconfiguring solitude with journey's weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting anchors early via "glass domes cracked and algae-coated"; viewport fireflies constrain perception and charge final image as ocean pressure forces escape, mirroring internal rhythm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging signaled early escalates accumulatively via syncing breath/heart to alarms; agency in "joined the fireflies’ dance" forecloses staying with felt cost of departure under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as created rhythm emerges from firefly sync and feather's shift from loss to transformation; final image "clutched... until the stars themselves went dark" offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV stable with perceptual bias toward star-like lights; voice texture via rhythmic prose like "pulsing in sync" modulates intensity; no dialogue, but internal signature distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "light pulsing" and "rhythm" across viewport beats dull density; "shadowseam wonder" inventive yet risks opacity without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater astrologer syncing with fireflies transforms belonging trope; feather's arc from char to clutched symbol feels inevitable, risking bold lyricism without gimmick.</comment>
