<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in survival glitch compels defragmentation choice with embodied anxiety via heartbeat and tears; interiority concrete in tracing shard's ridges. Minor slip: epiphany at voice feels slightly unearned without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ink patterns aligning to data/shard glow/radio voice for CR closure; cost legible in "Tears welled... each moment of understanding." One tightening via defragmentation materializes ghost without causality breaks; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's frosted dome, aged wood scent, and snow constrain isolation while charging final dawn image ("snow... like a thousand opals"); sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel existence) tightens accumulatively via defrag deepening to ghost voice, narrowing to wisdom acceptance; agency in keyboard work forces emotional trade-off with tears as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from failure emerges organically via shard/ink/ghost progression to final sanctuary image reweighting premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "ghost... part of her future."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (vibrations in fingertips, pattern-noticing); rhythmic modulation under building pressure, voice distinct in selective diction like "ephemeral patterns."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("swirling like galaxies," "danced like fireflies") during defrag beat slightly dulls propulsion; no loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of death-glitch/digital ghost via ink defrag in observatory transforms existential tropes; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established particulars without hedging.</comment>
