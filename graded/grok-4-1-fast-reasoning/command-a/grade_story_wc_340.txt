<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's warmly inquisitive nature drives concrete micro-choices like lingering in the library, with embodied emotions (heart quickening, tears) and a earned shift from detachment to warmth at the diary reveal. Internal conflict subtle but present in racing mind connecting riddle to mentor's words. Solo POV executes cleanly under pressure without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds floor-by-floor toward CR closure in diary decryption ("Joy is not the absence of anguish..."), with legible cost in emotional melting of detachment on tenth floor. Orientation anchored immediately (Elara, spire, ascent). Pattern taught by first floor, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound spire and aurora-scattered light constrain discoveries (goggles amplify patterns for hidden items) and charge final image (lenses revealing patterns, symbolizing inner light). Sensory details (frigid air, prism rainbows) weave into action, mirroring cold-to-warmth arc. No white-room; spatial choreography clear via elevator.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decrypt diary for joy beneath anguish) signaled early, tightens accumulatively per floor (riddle on fifth deepens), forcing endurance with felt cost (thinner air, emotional tears). Agency in searches forecloses detachment path; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from discoveries: final diary image reweights "seek joy beneath anguish" non-literally via internalized warmth, inviting ambiguity without moralizing. No tidy binary; counter-reading of literal quest lingers. Minor echo in quoted phrase but earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (inquisitive gaze, goggle-amplified sight) biases details character-specifically. Rhythmic prose modulates (short anticipatory sentences at chimes). No dialogue; compression purposeful in floor transitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "goggles glinted as she scanned" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor loops in "unfolded" and "scattered light" purposeful as motif, not artifact. Clean syntax, no muddled metaphors in peak diary beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator-level quest with light motifs and emotional repricing transforms tower trope organically. Risk in accumulative shard structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Familiar epiphany arc limits to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
