<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's charm shines in the quip to Krane ("Then again, neither are your traps"), revealing rogue traits under pressure; embodied reactions like trembling fingers and racing mind ground interiority. Dr. Krane applies relevant pressure, forcing alliance. Minor stock phrasing ("heart quickened") slightly dulls specificity, but final defiance endurance feels earned without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: entry leads to seed discovery, deciphering to sensed presence, confrontation to alliance and exit under Charged Poise closure ("defiance burning brighter" with felt cost of crackdown). One tightening via infiltration warning narrows options. Orientation anchored early (Elias in greenhouse by para 1); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains via shifting shadows and insect hum signaling presence, charging tension before Krane reveal. Sensory details (damp earth/jasmine, rustle of leaves) filter through Elias's urgency, mirroring internal warp. Final greenhouse silence as counterpoint charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure Lexicon message vs. detection) signaled early, tightens via sensed presence and infiltration reveal, forcing alliance trade-off. Agency in sneaking/quip endures with cost (hunted status). Escalation causal, cost legible in "we fight back."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of defiance vs. silence emerges organically from seed patterns and final "spark burning brighter," reweighting Thought Tax premise without statement. Subtext in Krane's test implies trust's fragility. Resonance in greenhouse silence lingering post-exit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (shadows/insects as threats); voice rhythmic, modulating from quiet entry to tense warp. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You passed"), advances plot via coordinates reveal. Minor filter verbs in deciphering beat but no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short tense sentences in warp moment building propulsion; density high in greenhouse details. Minor artifacts: "mind racing" paraphrase near "heart quickened," and occasional stock embodiment slightly dull non-closure beats. No closure touch or heavy loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thought Tax + Lexicon codes transform dystopian tropes via insect-greenhouse front and seed cipher. Risk in "warp" perceptual turn heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Fresh synthesis: defiance via garden-planted rebellion feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
