<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Slow-spoken trait particularized through patient study of objects and steady reading of letters aloud, earning release of regret; embodied hands-on compass and lace ground interiority without therapy-speak; minor stock phrasing like "weary soul" slips but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from compass spinning to settling, lace whispers, cove discovery, letters dissolving in final CR with cost of release legible in "heart lighter" and objects left behind; orientation anchored early in islet details; single tightening via compass direction suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Slick rocks and tides constrain path to cove, charging treacherous steps; sensory damp earth, salt, cerulean glow selective and POV-biased toward remembrance; recurring waves mirror internal tides without overt symbolism, environment shapes final image of dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking unspoken apologies signaled early, tightens accumulatively via compass-led discovery and letters' deepening to force renunciation; cost felt in tide-washed sorrow and lighter heart; agency in following and reading aloud forecloses retention path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of releasing regret emerges organically from tides dissolving letters, reweighting "color" premise in final image without moralizing; subtext in whispers and apologies carries ambiguity of forgiveness; resonant non-literal answer in sanctuary bridge ties arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of patient, rhythmic noticing (e.g., "weighing each word"); lyrical diction modulates from thick air to cerulean glow, supporting accumulative texture; purposeful compression in memory waves pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Some figurative density like "rhythmically placid melody" and "diffuse like a gentle breeze" borders overwriting in opening beats, but rhythm varies and propels to closure; no loops or scaffolds; minor repetitive "tides" phrasing purposeful for pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai patience, compass/lace relics, dissolving apologies transforms regret trope into tidal release; non-obvious color-as-emotion payoff feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
