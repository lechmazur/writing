<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Label-speak traits like "gently systematic" and "brazen calm" dominate over embodied emotion or contradictory impulses in scene; no micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, flattening internal conflict to summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of orchard transformations tightening to Charged Poise closure; final entry and smile reconfigure purpose with legible cost of impending death.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid integration of living stone pillars and copper wire into action, constraining branch-guiding choices; carvings discovery through goal-directed work charges final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of legacy remodel signaled early with accumulative deepening via pillar secrets narrowing time-bound options; cost of life felt but lacks agency-driven reversal beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Harmony theme emerges from particulars like intertwined roots, but final entry's "remind them of the respect we owe" borders on thematic echo, reducing emergent resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with consistent perceptual signature of systematic observation; rhythmic prose modulates calmly, perceptual bias filters setting purposefully without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("brazen calm," orchard "alive"/"spirit") and synonym churn in transformation beats dull density; clean syntax otherwise propels accumulatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical architecture unlocking civilization via dying caretaker's remodel; living pillars/orchard harmony transforms legacy trope organically without hedging.</comment>
