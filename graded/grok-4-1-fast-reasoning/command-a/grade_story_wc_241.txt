<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotion ("clover melancholy in her chest bloomed") and contradictory impulses (rebellious yet pragmatic) compel the final resolve; micro-choices like traversing aisles reveal values under reflective pressure. Final endurance to seek answers feels earned via father's legacy. Minor slip: epiphanies border on tidy rationality without peak irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scrawl reflections build density to CR closure ("lucid contradictions were not obstacles but guides"), reweighting stake with emotional cost of unresolved questions legible in final writing beat. One tightening via midnight return narrows to resolve. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lantern's mica pane as micro-setting constrains perception and charges closure image ("glowed softly"), refracting light to mirror internal complexity. Sensory details (rain whispers, book smells) selectively filter through Elara's priorities, evolving with her melancholy to resolve. Vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand father responsibly) signaled early, accumulates via scrawls to deepening realization that forecloses despair path with felt cost of inherited questions. Agency in endurance/renunciation of tidy answers; one cadence shift at writing suffices under textural lens. Stakes viscerally felt in "trembled" fingers and blooming melancholy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of contradictions as guides emerges organically from scrawls, father’s gamble, and lantern patterns, with final image offering non-literal resonant answer ("canvas, waiting for her to fill it"). Subtext in fragile pane's complexity avoids morals; complexity lingers without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (riddle-like scrawls as "puzzle piece," light as "heartbeat") biases toward pragmatic rebellion; rhythmic modulation builds from drift to resolve. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops (lantern light "flickering/soft/dim/steady" refracts repeatedly) and "river breaking through a dam" figurative strain dull closure edge slightly. No heavy artifacts or template cadence; strong verbs anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subway scrawls as map for paternal riddle transforms inheritance trope; lantern's mica patterns and "theoretically rebellious" yield memorable angle. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry; no derivatives.</comment>
