<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's cautious hope and grit constrain her to subtle counter over blocking, earning vigilant endurance; embodied via fingers tracing charts and hardened gaze at Hank. Internal conflict minimal but motivation intensifies credibly to closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decoding reveals structure → subsonic notice → counter-frequency causes distortion, yielding Charged Poise closure ("strange kind of peace") with ongoing battle cost legible in final bastion image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Radio station's subwoofer and spectrograph constrain interference tactic; vibrations and ethereal glow charge final vigilance image as bastion against cosmos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit signal) tightens via protagonist agency in counter-activation, foreclosing provocation; community divide and short-lived victory felt as cost charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Power plays theme emerges via signal gambit and counter, reweighted in final image of grit yielding peace without triumph; resonant via particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (signals as tricksters); Hank dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing status pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm propels activation beat ("air vibrated faintly"); minor repetition ("knew") doesn't obscure; high density integrates action/atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subsonic counter in radio station freshens cosmic signal trope; transforms via Elara's ingenuity into Charged Poise without gimmick.</comment>
