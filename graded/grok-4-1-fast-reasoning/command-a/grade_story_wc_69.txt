<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in preserving arts, but interiority generic with label-speak like "expectantly resigned"; lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, reducing earned change depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hums intertwining to choir growth and performance; CR closure via rediscovery lands on-page with conceptual cost in world's noise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Velvet library and rosette sensory details selective and purposeful, constraining focal choices; rosette charges final image as beacon, mirroring transformation from silence to resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of arts preservation tightens texturally via unity from humming, narrowing indifference; agency in "sing not to be heard, but to listen" forecloses discord path with felt prior loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via subtraction emerges organically from particulars like rosette-guided hums; final image resonant without overt moral, though "understood that... were not lost" borders echo (-0.4).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with musical perceptual signature; voice texture modulates rhythmically, dialogue sparse but natural and goal-driven in instruction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, density high sans loops; minor overwriting in opening metaphors coherent but dense without payoff, slightly dulling early propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choir ritual subtracting noise transforms vanishing arts trope; rosette's evolving role from talisman to beacon feels inevitable and risks quiet escalation.</comment>
