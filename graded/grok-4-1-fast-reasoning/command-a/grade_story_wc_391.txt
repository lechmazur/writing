<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is consistent but interiority relies on summary epiphanies like "she understood: the viaduct was not just a bridge but a metaphor," lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; change feels declared rather than earned through simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building via observations to Charged Poise closure in final viaduct image, where transformed spirit mirrors lake with conceptual cost of unyoking impatience; orientation anchored early, one tightening via realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like moon light dancing on lake and viaduct's hum constrain choices (pulling Elara, site of realization) and charge final image; POV-filtered priorities shape noticing without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpt patience) signaled early, coherent accumulative pressure tightens once via viaduct epiphany narrowing to deliberate pace, but abstract stakes lack visceral on-page cost beyond felt completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of patience revolution emerges organically from particulars like moon paths and viaduct, final image offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing; earned through struggle, invites ambiguity in gradual shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of deliberate observation; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, but occasional elevated diction slightly mismatches grounded mapper's lexicon in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops in observation beats ("mapping... studying," "began to see a rhythm") and occasional overwriting dull peak viaduct moment without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of horizon mapping, moon paths, and magnetic viaduct transforms impatience trope into quiet revolution; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
