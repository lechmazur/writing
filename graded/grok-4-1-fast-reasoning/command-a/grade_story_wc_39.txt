<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation as translator of generations is concrete and intensifies through jar-capturing and grandmother memory cue, compelling the whisper to the box; embodied emotions in "heart raced" and shard-listening show contradiction between loss (shattered jar) and hope. Internal conflict emerges in resistance of jammed gears versus persistent humming, earning purpose shift. Minor slip in tidy epiphany at "felt whole" but prior micro-choices anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from single note to autonomous melody spill, tightening to Charged Poise closure in shard-music image with legible emotional cost of shattered jar/remembrance. Orientation anchors early ("feral loft beneath the dunes" at dawn). Single scene causality intact, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity (wind whispers, rusted key glint, warm breath on cold metal) filters through Elias's wistful priorities, constraining choices like kneeling before box; dunes and loft evolve to charge final "golden sands shimmering" image. Micro-setting (jars, shard) mirrors internal states via tactile handling. No white-room; purposeful vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture/redemption via sounds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via resisted gears → fragile note → full autonomous play, narrowing options with jar drop cost; agency in humming/whispering drives deepening. Climax drop forces stance crystallization toward remembrance over perfection. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via preserved memories emerges organically from jar-sweetening and shard-listening, with final "jars... lighter" image offering non-literal resonance reweighting loss as soaring hope. Subtext in "music was the language of the soul" ties to conflict without moralizing. Complexity in sorrow/joy ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing ("voice a lonesome splendor"); rhythmic modulation accelerates at "tune spilling... like a river," suiting accumulative texture. No head-hopping or withholding; voice biases toward wistful idiom consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in sound-layering beats ("hum... weaving it into a melody"); rhythm varies with scene (short sentences at drop). Minor overwriting in stacked figures ("shimmering like captured light... symphony of time") dulls one high-pressure line but pattern-taught as lyrical; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure shard image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-capturing poet and autonomous music box transforms memory trope via jar-shard mechanics; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in "music still there, faint but undeniable" reconfiguration. No derivative templates; specific dunes/loft anchor bold premise.</comment>
