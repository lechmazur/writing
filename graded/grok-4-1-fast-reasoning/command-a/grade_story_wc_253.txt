<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between blank face and inner narration of whittling ("The knife cuts, the wood yields"), earning quiet endurance; flaws like brother's backstory feel anchored but slightly diagnostic in summary form.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in whittled heart beside bouquet, cost legible in "quiet resolve hardened" amid void; orientation anchored early in farmhouse/turbines; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Turbines' shadows and farmhouse constrain mood/rebellion, charging final image; whittled wood as micro-setting evolves tactilely through action; selective sensory focus (humming blades, pale light) mirrors internal void without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silent grief-rebellion signaled early, escalates accumulatively via whittling progression and inner deepening to cadence shift; cost felt in foreclosed open emotion, charging final heart placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief amid mandated cheer emerges organically from particulars like brittle flowers shifting to pulse beside heart; resonant non-literal close reweights hush with conceptual cost of unyielding silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature in mechanical actions vs. dramatic inner voice; rhythmic modulation builds texture without slippage; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in whittling/silence repetition dull propulsion slightly (e.g., multiple "whittled...resuming"); strong density and varied rhythm otherwise, no closure artifacts; read-aloud ear solid.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of happiness mandate with turbines/whittling heart transforms dystopian tropes via quiet rebellion; risk in lyric stasis heightens stakes organically.</comment>
