<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to maintain time flow intensifies credibly through discoveries, compelling higher-stakes choices like activating the device; interiority is concrete via chronometer flickers and urn warmth. Thaddeus applies relevant pressure as emotional catalyst. Final purpose shift feels earned but lacks deep contradictory impulses in peak activation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragment discoveries build density toward chamber reconfiguration; on-page Charged Poise closure stabilizes chronometer with Elara's binding as felt cost. Orientation anchors early via silo and town. Garage sale shard convenient but transitions legible; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silo's weathered metal and core shadows vividly filter through Elara's priorities, constraining inspections and chamber access. Garage sale bustle selective and purposeful. Silo evolution mirrors internal shift, charging final hum; recurring urn patterns as micro-setting tie to closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend time flow) signaled early, tightens via numbers' symbolic shift forcing chamber venture under Accumulative lens. Activation agency forecloses uncertainty with binding cost legible in "work far from over." One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Texture of time emerges organically from urn patterns and chronometer shifts, reweighted in final desk image without statement.

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density weaves setting into action without loops in peak beats. Minor paraphrase in time descriptions ("flow," "rhythm," "texture") but no scaffold obscuring closure; strong verbs propel to silo hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Timekeeper bound to silo with urn fragment puzzle transforms relic tropes into fresh temporal weaving premise. Garage sale cryptics and numbers-as-symbols inflections grow from particulars. Risky fantasy synthesis feels inevitable, heightening closure purpose.</comment>
