<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve moments is concrete and particular, embodied in locket handling, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; serene interiority shows no genuine struggle or micro-choices under pressure, with Mara's scene too brief to force alteration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure—Elara's documentation reconfigures her role with felt purpose cost in final image; one tightening via Mara's revelation suffices, orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blooming jetty and twilight constrain reflection and charge final image as witness character; sensory details (jasmine, salty tang, warm locket) selective via archivist bias, evolve with deepening mood without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of story preservation signaled early, tightens once via Mara's covenant reveal narrowing to generational tie; cost felt in emotional swelling and commitment, but pressure remains internal/serene without agency-testing reversal under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Regeneration theme emerges organically from locket-to-covenant arc and final documentation image reweighting preservation as participation; resonant without moralizing, complexity in adapting promises amid change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with archivist perceptual signature in deliberate, ink-tracing details; voice rhythmic and biased toward historical weight, Mara dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("promise made and remade," "gently thorough" echoes) and reflection-heavy telling slightly drag momentum; rhythm varies, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh archivist-covenant synthesis transforms preservation trope via jetty's endurance; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at charged final image, feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
