<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in reincarnation memory compels descent and orb touch, with embodied "brittle determination"; internal conflict thin as visions resolve too tidily without contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via hum's building density to CR closure (orb integration reconfigures isolation with conceptual cost of becoming bridge); orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial and stone door constrain unlocking choice; tidal shelves shifting with tides pressure navigation, charging final "shelves rearranging" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (independence from isolation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hum tightening to visions/orb; agency in door unlock and orb touch forecloses recluse path with felt reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of translating isolation to coexistence emerges via orb visions and final embodiment; resonant non-literal answer in sundial beacon reweights legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (Theralith lineage bias in noticing hum/shelves); rhythmic diction modulates from descent tension to harmonious end without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in sensory integration (parchment scent, moss stones); minor paraphrase loops on "hum" and "brittle" slightly drag mid-descent without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floating tidal library and stone-encoded Theraliths transforms guardian trope; risk in atomically reflective sundial pays off in causal unlock and beacon reprise.</comment>
