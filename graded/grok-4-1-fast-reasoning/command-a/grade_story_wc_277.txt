<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in observant traits compel the recalibration choice, with embodied unease at misaligned telescopes revealing contradiction under pressure. Final endurance of regret's burden earns stasis with visible cost in isolation. Minor slip in "solemn playfulness" label without full embodiment prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries build density to Charged Poise closure in telescope recalibration, reconfiguring misuse with symbolic cost felt in "peace amidst chaos." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via web of deceit narrows options. Summary progression slightly softens causality before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory's glass dome and misaligned telescopes vividly constrain investigation and charge final image, mirroring internal orbits via action-filtered details. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency narrowing to anomalies. Recurrent setting evolves to enable defiance without spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing misuse escalates accumulatively through discoveries and evasive tea, forcing agency in recalibration that forecloses spying with isolation cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution. Declared web lacks one visceral on-page test of personal risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth-devotion vs. regret emerges organically via recurring "orbits" shifting to redemption in final sky-gaze, offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Particulars like pen nib recharge prior material. Quiet resonance built from struggle avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with observant perceptual signature; voice modulates rhythmically from reflection to defiance. Director dialogue carries subtext in evasion. Clean free indirect style biases details purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure, but minor paraphrase loops on "resolve" and "rosewood pen nib" in reflective beats dull momentum slightly. No artifacts in peak recalibration; sensory propulsion strong. Overwriting in opening metaphors borders mixed vehicles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spying observatory and symbolic recalibration transforms journalism trope via heiress's traits; final image inevitability grows from particulars. Bold symbolic defiance risks sentimentality but coheres. Minor proximity to redemption arcs tempers peak.</comment>
