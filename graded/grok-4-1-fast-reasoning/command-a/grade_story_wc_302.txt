<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied reactions like tightening grip on warm watch; strength in cautious exuberance as consistent trait. Weakness: minimal contradictory impulses during pivotal writing moment, leaning archetypal without deep flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (hum, symbols) builds to Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in library trembling and dimming glow as she leaves with pulsing parchment. Orientation anchored early; one tightening at desk suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (parchment scent, metallic tang, endless glowing shelves) filters through POV urgency; recurring mist and watch constrain path and charge final image. Purposeful details evolve causally, mirroring internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unspoken words/answer) signaled early; textural escalation via hum-guidance and revelation narrows to conduit role with agency in writing/following. Cost unmistakable in ending time pressure and foreclosed sanctuary access.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of alive unspoken words needing voice emerges organically from symbols, writing, and realization; final parchment pulse offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting seeker-to-conduit arc. Complexity lingers in time/prison duality without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in mystical noticing (shifting symbols, syncing hum); rhythmic prose modulates elegantly under rising density, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; purposeful figurative layering (pulsing lights, dancing symbols) suits accumulative mode without muddle. Minor repetition of "hum" but no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of dream-library and living words transforms quest trope; cyclically reversed time motif risks bold nonlinearity, heightening stakes organically to charged close.</comment>
