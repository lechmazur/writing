<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover truth clear and consistent, rooted in interpreter role, but interiority relies on labels like "confidently uncertain" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during pen-writing climax; micro-choices lack embodied cost, feeling declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: anomaly origin → entry → visions → pen activation → writing stabilizes void as Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in pen cooling and lingering uncertainty; single scene anchors orientation immediately, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anomaly and void constrain entry/writing choices vividly across senses, pen as recurring micro-setting charges final image; sensory hierarchy reflects interpreter bias toward "whispers" and time fragments without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh anomaly origin) signaled early, tightens via entry and pen warming under causal lens, agency in writing forecloses distortion path with felt cost in stabilized sky; one decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of editing via understanding emerges organically from visions to relational writing, final image of cold pen and "confidently uncertain" peace reweights premise without moralizing; earned resonance avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with interpreter's perceptual signature (deciphering "whispers," time fragments); rhythmic prose modulates intensity at void entry, no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel via integrated sensory images, but minor paraphrase loops on pen ("dried-up relic," "glow fading") and elevated diction ("kaleidoscope of possibility") slightly dull peak writing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pen as relational history editor in anomaly transforms tropes organically; risk in abstract void physics pays off at unbend climax without late rules.</comment>
