<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's jitteriness is embodied in fingers brushing pendant and tightened grip, with contradictory impulses in hesitation versus proceeding under hum's urging. Internal conflict with mentor's absence drives micro-choices like lingering fingers at handover. Final endurance as chosen carrier feels earned with felt cost of shared heartbeat, though scholar's reveal borders unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hum's density builds from faint to thrum, reconfiguring Elara's role via CR at "the fade now called to her" with conceptual cost of altered purpose. Single scene anchors orientation early (Elara on ridgeway ~50 words). One tightening via scholar's revelation narrows courier identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora's rippling light and narrowed ridgeway constrain ascent and cast dancing shadows that heighten unease. Pendant wings catch glow, recurring as micro-setting charging final "aurora-lit ridgeway stretched behind her." Sensory selection (chill wind, visible breath) reflects jittery urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivery amid jitteriness/absence) signaled early; textural escalation via hum's intensification syncs to heartbeat, forcing realization. Scholar encounter tightens pressure, crystallizing stance with cost of "adrift" resolved into shared rhythm. Agency in proceeding despite unease forecloses mere courier path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of relics choosing carriers to coax wonder emerges via pendant's attunement and final image reweighting routine delivery. Subtext in scholar's "waiting for you" implies mentor's foresight without statement. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing, lingering in fade's call.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (aurora pulsing in time with heartbeat); voice modulates rhythmically from jittery fragments to charged poise. Dialogue natural/subtextual: scholar's "It's been waiting for you" pursues revelation. No head-hopping; diction fits courier's wonder-tinged lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short ascent sentences accelerating to handover; high density in "pendant's hum now a steady thrum, as if urging her forward." Minor paraphrase loops on jitteriness/Alaric early (-0.3), but no closure touch; vivid verbs like "germinate" propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fantasy premise transformed by emotional-vibrational relic mechanics and fade boundary. Fresh synthesis: mentor's "seeds" germinate via sympathetic hum into purpose. Risk in quiet CR payoff feels inevitable from accumulative texture.</comment>
