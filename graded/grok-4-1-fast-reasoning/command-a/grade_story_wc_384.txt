<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in trembling hand and chest weight lifting during hesitation and erasure; contradictory impulses shown in pause before thorn moves. Final forgiveness earned by prior pain carry. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "chain breaking within her soul" slightly genericizes peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sanctuary details and emotional buildup to ink dissolving as RR/Charged Poise with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. One tightening via hesitation to action suffices; closure legible with blank scroll canvas.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stalactite drip as recurring micro-setting synchronizes heartbeat then slows, constraining ritual pace and charging final resumption image. Aurora warms face and brightens post-erasure, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgive via unmaking) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through hesitation to thorn's autonomous move and weight lift. Agency in pressing thorn and whispering; cost legible in foreclosed bitterness path. Emotional price unmistakable in blank scroll realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiving unfinished emerges organically from erasure act; final blank canvas and brighter aurora reweight past burden without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like faded ink dissolving as mist. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in aurora/stalactite noticing tied to emotional state; lyrical voice modulates rhythmically from hushed to alive. No head-hopping; diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (slow drip sync to faster erasure); high density in integrated sensory/action lines. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during peak erasure ("mist in morning sun," "crystalline teeth") slightly muddles without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forger's treason skill into emotional unmaking via magical thorn; transforms forgiveness trope through sanctuary ritual. Bold lyric risk heightens closure image without gimmickry.</comment>
