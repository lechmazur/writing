<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to witness endings is clear and intensifies via the man's question, compelling her realization; interiority concrete in trembling foundations. Weakness: epiphanies border unearned therapy-speak, as in "rhythm of endings" without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final change feels credible but lacks a micro-choice foreclosing a path with sharp cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of survivor stories builds to CR closure in final paras, reconfiguring her quest with felt cost ("weight lift, grip...tightening"). Orientation anchored immediately in marina; one meaningful deepening via shelter interaction suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ice "whisper[ing]", fog-distorted silhouette) integrate into action; parasol as recurring micro-setting charges final image aloft under northern lights, constraining her symbolic gesture. Atmosphere mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clear in dock-to-shelter move.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn "sound of...end") signaled early, tightens accumulatively via man's whisper ("Do you ever wonder what it sounds like?"), forcing realization; agency in listening/presence forecloses fear path. Escalation coherent under lens but cost legibility mostly felt, not visibly altering tactics sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from ice/survivor images and parasol reprise, culminating in non-literal resonant answer: endings as "lullaby" reweighting fear to solace. Subtext in silences/gestures strong; avoids moralizing but embraces ambiguity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (loose-gripped reality in poetic notices like "ice seemed to pulse"); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven (Mara's knowing smile advances closure); no head-hopping, elision minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but overwriting in opening metaphors ("jagged shards...broken teeth") risks coherence in high-pressure beats; minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "fold in patience" echoes). Propulsion strong, no major artifacts dulling closure image; read-aloud ear solid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism via volunteering transforms tropes; parasol's evolving charge feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic accumulative frame heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
