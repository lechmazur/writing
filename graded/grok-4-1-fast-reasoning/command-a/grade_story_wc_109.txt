<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oracle's obsession rooted in years of gathering tales, embodied in gleaming eyes and trembling fingers on personal story; mild internal conflict surfaces in faltering voice, earning endurance toward goal. Minor slip: "mildly obsessed" label underconstrains contradictory impulses in pivotal retelling beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stories build map via silences, culminating in Charged Poise CR where mind's-eye map crystallizes as last star vanishes ("the oracle knew their work was far from over"), with conceptual cost of endless pursuit legible. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, one tightening via personal story suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (howling winds, crackling pages, ambered hush deepening); fort absorbs narrative ("walls humming faintly"), constraining ritual and charging final image of map shaping amid vanishing star. POV-filtered details purposeful, no white-room; recurring star/object constrains timeframe choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping endless night) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening stories to personal falter/memory, narrowing to crystallized map with felt cost of perpetual work ("work was far from over"). Agency in silence-sculpting retelling; one tightening coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of endless night via silence emerges organically from story contours/shadows; final image reconfigures premise non-literally ("map not of places, but of moments, of silences"), resonant with ambiguity of joy in obsession without moralizing. Particulars (child's dream, star's vanish) build complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing whispers, glows, pauses); rhythmic prose modulates (sparse retellings vs. palpable hush), compression purposeful/lyric-taught. No head-hopping; voice textured via hush variations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short pauses mimic silence); purposeful hush repetitions teach pattern without loops. Minor artifact: exact "flaking gold leaf booklet" x4 borders template cadence in mid-beats, slightly dulling propulsion before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence-summarizing to map night transforms oracle trope via textural accumulation; risk in lyric method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight ("sculpting the silence, shaping it into a map"). Bold, non-obvious angle on darkness obsession.</comment>
