<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between duty and curiosity is embodied in trembling fingers breaking the seal and frantic key-strokes, earning the closure choice with felt dread; minor label-speak like repeated "bravely conflicted" dilutes without fully undermining specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain anchors early (letter arrival → seal broken → terminal access → data copied) with on-page CR closure in "no going back" amid ticking alert; orientation clear by para 2; single scene holds lens without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frosted glass archives, frigid air, and icy walls constrain descent and amplify turmoil, charging final shroud-like quiet; sensory selection (visible breath, muffled snow) mirrors stakes without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (duty vs truths) tightens causally via letter → encryption layers → imminent alert, forcing copy under time pressure with legible cost in betrayal dread at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth's cost emerges organically from suppressed data flood to final changed world; resonant CR in snow-stepping reweights bravery without moralizing, but lacks deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (silence as judgmental); rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("echoing library under snow" x4, "dizzying quiet" x2, "contraband truths" churn) and repetitive stems dull density throughout, including final third image; −1.7 artifact cap applied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cryo-archives hiding volatile networks freshens forbidden knowledge trope via archivist's breach; final CR feels earned without late rules.</comment>
