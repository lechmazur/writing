<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to build unity roots consistently in traits like quiet defiance, driving micro-choices from anonymous runs to public gathering; interiority concrete via embodied tension at widow's doorstep. Earned change in lighter secret weight and community response forecloses isolation with felt cost. Minor flaw: minimal contradictory impulses shown in scene, no deep internal alternation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: food runs seed pattern, widow revelation tightens to announcement/gathering closure as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring isolation to unity with ongoing sanctions cost legible in final peace image. Orientation anchored early (Mara, ridge, sanctions). One meaningful deepening via revelation narrows anonymity option.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arbor's cracked tiles and lanterns constrain gathering choice, mirroring resolve; sensory selective (wind whispers, moonlight freeze) reflects urgency. Recurring arbor/terra-cotta charges final beacon image. Spatial choreography clear across ridge/hut shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unity vs. sanctions hollowing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via revelation forcing public stance, culminating in gathering agency that crystallizes family vision. Tightening forecloses pure anonymity; cost felt in persistent sanctions but charged by determination shine.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilient unity emerges organically from bell rings shifting from reminder to promise, final image reweighting survival to thriving without moral state. Subtext in anonymous-to-shared defiance invites ambiguity on isolation's true cost. No direct statements; resonance from particulars like girl/elder offers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (hope in silence); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm at "bell clutched tightly" stress. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("just me," "you're the one"); no head-hopping, diction POV-fit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short punch at widow call-out); density high, but minor overwriting in metaphors like "dwindling like embers" and "amplified quiet" repetition dulls peak gathering slightly. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Exile unity via bell/food runs transforms survival trope through specific intergenerational vision and anonymous-public arc. Fresh inflection in revelation momentum to arbor beacon; no close famous echoes.</comment>
