<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in freedom/solitude from escape, intensifying via mirror visions; interiority poetic but internal conflict more reflective summary than simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal mirror beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from patterns/rope to mirror CR closure; cost legible in "heart lighter... endlessly" as reconfiguration forecloses discovery path; orientation anchored early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto patterns/body/rope constrain choices (tracing leads to alcove/mirror) and charge final image; sensory details selective via POV urgency, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture) signaled early, tightens via mirror's impossible versions narrowing to renunciation; agency in reciting/coiling shows endurance with felt cost of endless rewrite, coherent under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of time/choices as poem emerges organically from rope/pattern/mirror particulars; final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (rhythms in noticing patterns/time); voice modulates intensity, purposeful compression legible under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language pattern-taught via motifs without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet/energy beings/time-as-poem via rope/mirror; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
