<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in observance drives the journey to the clearing, but interiority relies on abstract phrases like "luminous disbelief" without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; fiddler's change to playing the fiddle feels earned but lacks embodied cost in peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from flake study to landscape alignment and clearing unraveling; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in final image of whole flake and fiddle notes with journey's felt effort as cost; orientation anchored early at pullout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Landscape details like "jagged peak" aligning with flake pixels constrain the path and charge the final clearing image; sensory selection (golden light, thinner air) reflects observant POV narrowing under purpose; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the map tightens via one deepening realization ("each pixelated fragment was a piece"), forcing journey agency with visible cost in steeper path; pressure coheres accumulatively without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of possibility from "never" emerges organically through flake-to-sanctuary arc and final melody without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "gateway crossed" reweights prior disbelief, embracing ambiguity of defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of dynamic observance (e.g., "fingers...tracing the contours"); rhythmic modulation builds to closure without head-hopping or withholding; no dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "weave stories into the air," but minor overwriting in abstract repetitions ("secrets," "mystery") slightly dulls peak unraveling; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pixelated amnesty and scaffold flutters transforms mystery trope into textured revelation; risk-taking in poetic accumulation heightens stakes organically to inevitable fiddle close.</comment>
