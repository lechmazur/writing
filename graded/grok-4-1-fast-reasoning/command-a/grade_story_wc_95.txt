<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mechanical arm integrates well into gestures revealing pressure, but final realization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward summary epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with debate density building to CR closure ("the destination... within him all along") with conceptual cost of foreclosed external search; Mara's hesitation provides one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sundial constrains debate gestures ("traced the sundial’s lines") and charges final image; brook's burble mirrors silence/music evolution purposefully without visual overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover overture via duel) signaled early tightens via Elias's press after hesitation, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens; cost felt in foreclosed prior certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of questions-as-journey emerges organically from debate particulars, resonating in final atrium image; minor ding for near-explicit articulation ("Questions were not paths to answers") bordering thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (arm whirring, prismatic light); dialogue carries subtext and distinction, modulating rhythm with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in exchanges; minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("fractured rainbows," "labyrinth") slightly dulls propulsion without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosophical fencing via sundial/needle transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric debate heightens stakes toward CR without gimmickry.</comment>
