<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots consistently in grief and legacy, with embodied hands "hunched over her workbench" and micro-choice to press the stencil earning the tattooed renewal. Internal conflict layers subdued ardor against hollowness without alternating summaries. Minor slip in unearned epiphany feel at "it had all been leading to this moment," but closure change scales to prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from routine to curtain shimmer and stencil glow, delivering on-page RR closure via tattoo and "renewed determination" with felt grief cost. Orientation anchors Elara in observatory by para 2. Pivotal inciting shimmer motivated by "curious" approach tightens stakes cleanly; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's glass panes, brass telescope, and curtains filter starlight and trigger magic, constraining the tattoo choice and charging final workbench image. Sensory hierarchy (hum, glow, flower scent) reflects Elara's priorities, integrated via action. No generic placeholders; "genuinely artificial" detail plausibly enables paradox.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief-reconnection signaled early tightens via curtain energy pulling her to stencil, narrowing to magical agency with prior hollowness as cost. Accumulative escalation reweights through pulsing vine projection; final crafting forecloses isolation. Minor abstractness in origami stakes, but pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from decay emerges organically via vine, origami coordinates, and seed pendant, culminating in resonant whisper "to teach withering to bloom again" reweighting grief without moralizing. Particulars like crumbling greenhouse sites avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "promise, not just to her husband’s memory."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward legacy objects (vine tracing, origami); voice texture modulates from subdued to confident via syntax shifts at tattoo moment. No head-hopping or withholding; diction like "subdued ardor" suits jeweler's idiom. Rhythmic control heightens magical bloom scent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sensory propulsion in "room filled with the scent of blooming flowers" advances without loops. Minor overwriting in curtain "shimmered faintly, as if charged," but no artifacts dull closure; strong verbs anchor final "etched with the same spiraling vine."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism in "curtains of intention" and origami coordinates transforms grief tropes via observatory paradox. Risky genuinely artificial setting heightens stakes organically; final seed pendant feels inevitable from vine motif without derivative echoes.</comment>
