<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Traits consistent and motivate discoveries to ritual, but interiority summary-heavy with labels like "tranquilly perceptive"; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal ritual beat, yielding unearned final peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via fragment density increase to resonant reconfiguration at ritual (ghosts dissolve, oasis stirs) with legible cost in "air grew heavy"; orientation anchored early; ghosts-visible tightens meaningfully without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting filters through Elias's perceptions (light through glass, wind whispers), constrains exploration via skeletal gardens/stones; stained glass box charges closure image while cradled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore covenant) signaled via scroll, tightens via ghosts-visible reversal forcing voice-giving; cost unmistakable in heavy emotional air during ritual under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence's weight emerges via particulars (ghosts' mute plea, melody breaks it); final awakening image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting unspoken covenant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature attuned to subtleties (bees hum, patterns shift); diction/rhythm modulates poetically yet legibly, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High figurative density purposeful for tone but borders overwriting in opener ("sun dipped...amber and crimson"); minor paraphrase loops in "whispers" motif dull propulsion slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ghost tropes into guardians of unspoken words via beekeeping oasis logic; stained glass/covenant fragments feel inevitable, risk-taking in mute eloquence pays off at ritual.</comment>
