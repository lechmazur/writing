<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in rebel traits drives choices like wading deeper and transmitting data, but interior conflict is mostly summarized ("too young, too naive") rather than shown in contradictory impulses during the enforcer climax; micro-choices reveal resourcefulness effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression from puddle-map lead-in to key-unlock, archive discovery, and transmission DC closure; enforcer arrival tightens options on-page with legible cost in imminent capture, though early backstory briefly delays full anchoring past 120 words without disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like water lapping at waist and star reflections constrain choices (aligns keyhole) and charge final wink image; lagoon evolves causally from entry resistance to escape shadows, mirroring internal resolve without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of igniting resistance escalates via causal turns (door opens, enforcers echo) narrowing to transmission agency; one tightening at climax forces adaptation with felt capture risk, though abstract "tyranny of indifference" undercuts visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of defiance against buried truths emerges organically from ledger broadcast and escape image reweighting rebellion; resonant without moralizing, but indulgence in phrases like "ghost in their machine" borders on overt assertion near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent perceptual bias toward resourceful signs (puddles, key edges); rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively from poetic opening to clipped climax urgency, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("key... heavy, a reminder"; "carefully resourceful" echoes) and elevated diction ("auric lagoon shimmered... heavens spilled") dull peak momentum without pattern payoff; strong verbs propel most beats, but minor scaffold in reflective openers drags density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puddle-map method and defunct key symbol transforms rebel trope into coded defiance; escape as "ghost in their machine" risks cliche echo, but lagoon-archive payoff feels earned and particular.</comment>
