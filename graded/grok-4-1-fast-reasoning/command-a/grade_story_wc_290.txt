<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in passage squeeze and wall contraction battle, earning final embrace of mutiny; interiority concrete via trembling fingers and pounding heart. Minor epiphanic summary at "wistful rebellion in her heart" slightly softens peak cost legibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to chamber exhale and walls shifting/expanding RR closure; cost felt in "battle against the fear that threatened to consume her" before reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early in shadowed nexus; one tightening via organ code suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Narrow passage and contracting walls constrain claustrophobic choices, charging final expanded path image. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective: stone scent, vibrating air mirror internal pulse without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Claustrophobia stake signaled early tightens via passage test and wall shift reversal under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance agency with felt fear cost. No coincidence resolution; single deepening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fear-liberation emerges organically from compass-father anchor, organ memories, and mutiny embrace without statement; final shard-path image offers non-literal resonant answer. Minor abstraction in "spatial mutiny" naming slightly dilutes emergence from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (compass quiver as "alive"); rhythmic modulation peaks in chamber vibration without head-hopping or withholding. Voice texture distinct in whisper/echo diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but minor overwriting in stacked figures ("shadows danced like specters," "exhale") risks coherence in chamber peak; no loops, clean mechanics. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms explorer trope via metaphysical compass-organ code and phobia as spatial mutiny metaphor; risks bold in reality-reshaping premise without gimmick, inevitable in closure.</comment>
