<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through sound layers, compelling realization; interiority concrete via evoked scenes. Internal conflict mild, lacking contradictory impulses in pivotal activation moment. Earned change via exhaustion, but archetypal sage without deep flaws limits to strong band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density builds to CR closure in final realization, reweighting progress premise with exhaustion cost legible in "exhausted but enlightened." Orientation anchored early in lab intro. Single tightening via duality sound suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Auditory sensory hierarchy apt for lab, with lens as recurring object constraining device choice and charging final symbol. Details selective (cluttered shelves, whispers) mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Carbide glow line integrates tactilely, evolving with sounds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover connection) signaled early, tightens texturally via factory despair sound narrowing to balance insight. Agency in activation/immersion forecloses isolation path with felt exhaustion cost. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection vs. progress emerges organically from sound particulars, not statement; final lens image offers non-literal answer reweighting industrial duality. Ambiguity lingers in ongoing work without tidy moral. No Thematic Echo despite reflective close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in auditory bias; diction modulates from descriptive to immersive in sound waves. No head-hopping or withholding; rhythmic control heightens insight without elision issues. Voice coherent, avoiding generic templates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, propulsion fits contemplative escalation. Minor paraphrase loops in reflection (e.g., progress duality) but no closure touch or filter stacks. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of auditory archaeology transforms relic tropes via prism lens/prism-song; risk in textural pilgrimage pays off in CR without gimmick. Non-obvious angle on industrial loss feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold voice anchors specificity.</comment>
