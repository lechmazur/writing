<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resilient positivity shown consistently via smile amid warning and strain, compelling higher-stakes rift entry; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, relying on label "resiliently positive demeanor never wavered."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: patterns map rift entry therefore ferry discovery therefore hourglass reset as DC with weakening cost; orientation anchored early in grotto; single-shard arc with tightening at splintering consciousness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto patterns and starlight constrain mapping/reading choice and charge hourglass reprise; rift kaleidoscope mirrors splintering stakes; sensory hierarchy visual/tactile fits mystic urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to merge timelines signaled early, tightens via transient warning narrowing options and rift strain forcing reset; agency in handing hourglass and channeling energy forecloses escape with bodily cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Endurance amid transience emerges via outlasting timelines and final glowing sand reweighting change without moral; ambiguity in "forever changed" invites reflection on cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward patterns/time; poetic diction/rhythm modulates from steady to stretched in rift; dialogue subtextual in transient exchange pursuing escape handoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety in kaleidoscope dissolution but minor paraphrase loops on "patterns" and "smile" across beats dull density; no heavy artifacts, propulsion clear in action integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-rift ferry rescue via backward hourglass transforms vanishing trope; risk in nonlinear shards heightens ingenuity without obscuring causal closure.</comment>
