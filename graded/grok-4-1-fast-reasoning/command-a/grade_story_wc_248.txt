<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; labels like "analytically intuitive mind" and "volcanic tenderness" feel stock rather than embodied in micro-choices. Final tears provide emotional cost, but no genuine internal struggle or blind spots compound before closure. Smooth competence without flaws complicating choices undermines character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as artistic clues build density to CR closure at scroll unrolling, with tears as felt emotional cost reweighting the promise. Orientation anchored early ("quiet hours after midnight... lost civilization archive"). One meaningful deepening via escalating discoveries suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Selective details like "vandalized self-portrait, its canvas slashed" and "mural partially obscured by dust" integrate into action, mirroring internal quest. Archive as labyrinth guides progression without constraining choices tightly. No object charges final image beyond scroll; vivid but not pivotal for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early, with accumulative deepening via clues narrowing to scroll. No reversal tests commitment; pressure coherent but low, lacking trade-offs or live options foreclosed until vague emotional cost at tears. Agency in following trail, but no moral calculus or loss alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of love/sacrifice emerges organically from art trail to promise revelation, with final "light that would illuminate the past" as resonant CR reweighting destruction motif without moralizing. Complexity in civilization's demise lingers via ambiguity. No overt statements; earned from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward patterns ("subtle similarities in the brushstrokes"). Distinct texture in rhythmic descriptions, but occasional label-speak ("volcanic tenderness") drifts from embodied voice. No head-hopping; compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("trail of artistic creations" echoed thrice; "analytically intuitive" twice) creates paraphrase loops, dulling density in discovery beats. Template cadence in "They [action]... Their [trait]..." runs. Some overwriting with labels in peak scroll moment; rhythm varies but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist trope (not burning but uncovering) via art trail in archive transforms seeker archetype. Risk in quiet CR closure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; particular details like slashed portrait feel organic and memorable.</comment>
