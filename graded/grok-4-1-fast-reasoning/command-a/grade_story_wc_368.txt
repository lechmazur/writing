<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in donor heart's gift drives clear choices like using the wing to track stories, but interiority leans abstract ("mind was quietly explosive") without enough contradictory impulses in scene; woman's quick backstory dump feels unearned rather than pressured revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final lines ("pull of another story... journey far from over"), cost felt in ongoing fragility; orientation anchored early (Kael in tea house at sunset); single scene coherent, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tea house and wing as micro-setting constrain choices (sunlight on sill reveals threads) and charge final image (wing muted but beautiful in misty valley); sensory details (jasmine, groaning beams) vivid and purposeful through dyer's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn why stories magnetize) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via woman's shared loss, narrowing to purpose crystallization; cost legible in "holding on... or letting go" trade-off echoed in Kael's ongoing pull.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared stories illuminating fragility emerges organically from wing motif and dialogue, reweighted non-literally in ending ("illuminate the path for others"); no moralizing, resonant without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with dyer's perceptual signature (iridescent hues, sun trails); dialogue natural/subtextual ("holding on is what keeps us afloat"), advances stakes; rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise at close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor label artifacts ("quietly explosive," "mind... churning") in early beats create paraphrase feel without payoff; no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye master's post-transplant "magnetism" with iridescent wing tracking transforms familiar reflection tropes; risk in magical realism (story-threads, sun trails) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
