<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to teach silence comfort drives consistent micro-choices like course adjustments and dialogue, earning Mira's change with embodied calm. Mira's restlessness yields to solace via vial-guided interactions, showing relationship as crucible. Minor weakness: Mira's internal conflict externalized without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, slightly softening peak emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via vial's evolving states building to Charged Poise closure—Mira's smile, lighter steps, vial's glow reconfigure emotional transit with felt cost of unraveled anxiety. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2 (Elias, terrace, gondola). One tightening: vial's indigo shift deepens stakes, holding lens cleanly without slips touching ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vial as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (course to quieter sectors) and charges final image (pristine clarity mirroring tranquility). Sensory details (jasmine, light fracture, whistle echo) selective via Elias's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent; terrace's hush guides agency purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's turmoil vs. silence's comfort—tightens texturally via vial's clouding-to-clearing and dialogue reversal, narrowing to earned stasis in floating garden. Elias's agency (steering, pausing) forces stance crystallization with legible cost (anxiety unravel). One meaningful deepening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence as soul-mirror emerges organically via vial's shifts and "space where everything can be heard," reweighting transit motif in final image without moralizing. Subtext in pauses and Elias's nod invites ambiguity on self-comfort. Resonant non-literal answer: vial's glow charges prior turmoil into lingering solace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person via Elias's perceptual bias (vial as talisman); voice's poetic rhythm modulates with hush-building intensity. Dialogue natural, subtextual ("Isn't silence just… nothing?"), distinct idioms (Elias steady, Mira hesitant). No head-hopping; diction controlled, perceptual signature in silence curation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene cadence, propelling from drift to garden pause; density high, sentences multi-task. Weakness: minor paraphrase loops on vial ("clearing," "swirl," "cloudy") and template stems ("the storm glass vial began to...") across three instances dull mid-beats (−0.6), but closure image sharp. No artifacts in ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotion-sensitive vial in prism terrace transforms silence trope into tactile healing system, inevitable via Elias's method. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes, premise commits to hush-logic fully.</comment>
