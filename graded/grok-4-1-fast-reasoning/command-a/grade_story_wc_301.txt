<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in chronicling others versus self shown through map-tracing and note-playing; flaws like guilt drive micro-choices with visible cost in raw ache. Man's brief pressure reveals relational dynamic without dilution. Minor epiphany summary in final lines slightly undercuts full earning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from station entry to graffiti discovery to man's words, culminating in Charged Poise closure where accordion/map feels lighter, reconfiguring weight with felt memory cost in "first steps of her path." Orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening via graffiti echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy-overgrown station and graffiti wall constrain choices (e.g., breath catches at "The river knows," prompting notebook), charging final sanctuary image; sensory details (crunching glass, creaking leather) filter through Elara's priorities. Recurrent accordion as micro-setting mirrors internal decay precisely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early via graffiti wisdom; textural escalation deepens through post-medication ache and man's words narrowing to personal map-tracing, with agency in unfolding her self-drawn map and cost in shifted-but-unlifted weight. Quiet but coherent pressure crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-map emerges organically from graffiti ("map, not a destination"), accordion patches, and river echoes, reweighted in final image of tracing lines without literal moral; purposeful ambiguity in "raw solace" invites reflection on process over arrival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in river-chronicler bias (e.g., currents/secrets); dialogue natural/subtextual ("new tune," "where you've been") advances stakes. Rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to tense (rustling) without drift; minor filter-verb stacks in reflection beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in woven sensory/action lines; rhythm varies (short note sentence amid longer); minor paraphrase loops on "map" (frayed edges, lines/dots) and figurative density ("cathedral of decay") in opening slightly overwrites but patterns toward closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river chronicler, medication clarity, and accordion-as-personal-map transforms self-forgiveness trope; risk in textural build without causal fireworks heightens quiet resonance, with graffiti wisdom as non-obvious guide feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
