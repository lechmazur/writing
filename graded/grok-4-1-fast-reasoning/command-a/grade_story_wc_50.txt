<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority poetic yet generalized without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. No earned change with visible cost—breakthrough feels competent but untested. Diagnostic phrasing like "his motivation was clear" abstracts rather than reveals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via labor details to Charged Poise closure in timer activation and felt wonder/fragility. Orientation anchored early in cavern/timer setup. Causality thins at "made a breakthrough"—summary skips motivated linkages, but closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in fragile echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marble cavern vivid and selective, with reflections/shadows mirroring Elias's focus and constraining method via light angles at dusk. Sensory integration purposeful through action (gears align with dusk). Body/tools (hands, timer) charge final hum image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix timer for echoes) signaled early but no tightening, reversal, or agency test—labor summarized without pressure narrowing options. No on-page cost alters tactics; success via insight lacks opposition. Static endurance without felt price flattens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder emerges organically from images (jars of laughter, fragile snowflake) without statement; final timer hum reconfigures echoes as attainable. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, but lacks complexity via unresolved counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias toward peripheral details; voice modulates poetically yet consistently. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic hum/melody echoes. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("echoes," "reflections," "angles") across beats dull density without taught pattern; paraphrase in "days turned into nights" stalls propulsion. Rhythm varies but overwriting in descriptions (e.g., "warm, like sunlight... fragile, like snowflake") risks muddle in peak. Info density functional but scaffold-like summaries erode momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith/reflections/echo-harvest transforms myth into tactile pursuit; premise non-obvious with dusk alignment turn. Risks poetic vignette successfully without gimmick. Minor derivative whisper of alchemist trope personalized through peripheral trait.</comment>
