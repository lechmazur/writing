<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to reclaim courage clear and rooted in scars/backstory, intensifies to internal renunciation of pill; embodied emotions via chill/bones but micro-choices sparse, with realization leaning summary over contradictory impulses in pivotal letter moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens inferred and holds: density builds from codes/pillbox to letter realization; on-page CR closure with conceptual cost (past acceptance forecloses erasure fantasy) in "even the burned could ignite again."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details selective/POV-filtered (wind whispers secrets, snow markings); mist/snow constrain path to tree and charge final lifting image mirroring awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake signaled early, one accumulative deepening via letter changes knowledge/options; cost felt in resolve but pressure declarative, lacking visceral trade-offs under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of remembered courage emerges from pillbox/letter/scars without statement; final image resonantly reweights "find" premise to internal stir, embracing scar-cost complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (image-biased noticing); rhythmic modulation supports introspective pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites most sentences (e.g., "mist clung like forgotten veil"), creating muddle in reflective beats; minor paraphrase loops on courage/broken reduce propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Spy scars/pillbox symbols offer fresh inflection on redemption arc, but introspective journey treads familiar literary vignette template without bold transformation.</comment>
