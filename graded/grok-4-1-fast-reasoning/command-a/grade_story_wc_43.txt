<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation clear and consistent, but traits like "decisiveness matched only by her kindness" told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in pivotal reunion beat; interiority concrete yet lacks embodied conflict under time pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise RR in final image of vinyl seeming whole and room warmed; orientation anchored early in haven; cost legible in "time running out" and estrangement mended with emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (lavender/eucalyptus scent, shimmering air) reflects therapist's priorities and charges final warmed room; vinyl fragment as micro-setting constrains emotionally and mirrors closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via blood work → call → reunion with felt relational cost; low external pressure, but endurance in Elara's quiet presence forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of fractured wholeness emerges organically from vinyl reprise and reunion without moralizing; final image resonantly reweights mundane hymns into reconciliation, lingering with ambiguity of "long after she was gone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward soothing details; voice poetic yet consistent, dialogue sparse but natural ("Claire"); minor elevated diction like "hymning" fits therapist idiom without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "scent of hope" repeats and "hymning the mundane" twice dull density; overwriting in "pulsing stillness" strains without payoff, but rhythm varies and closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aerial hospice and vinyl relic transforms reunion trope through therapist's lens; lacks bold risk, settling into sentimental familiarity without non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
