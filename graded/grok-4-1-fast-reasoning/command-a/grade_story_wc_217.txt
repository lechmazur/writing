<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Characters' traits drive consistent actions and shared change, with feather handoff revealing relational crucible; strength in earned motivation convergence at repair/release. Weakness in somewhat archetypal poet/wanderer lacking embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, e.g., no shown hesitation in sharing poetry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from poetic buildup to Charged Poise closure in kite's glowing ascent and final shared image, with legible cost in man's rediscovered sight. Single scene oriented early ("cobalt lagoon after rain"); kite snap incites causal beat linking curiosity to repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (wet earth/salt, shimmering surface) filter through poet's priorities, mirroring internal harmony quest; lagoon/feather/kite constrain choices (edge positioning, wind release) and charge final image. No slips; purposeful over vivid catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via kite repair collaboration narrowing isolation; agency in synchronized tending/release forecloses solitude with felt relational cost. Subtle but coherent pressure under lens, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete beauty emerges organically from feather/kite repair and glowing poem, reweighting man's loss in final image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal closure answer via shared hush; ambiguity in "company we keep" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "arranging thoughts like beads"); dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing voices via brevity vs. reflection. Rhythmic modulation supports lyric texture without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm varying openings/paragraphs; motifs like "burnished hush" pattern-taught without loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "weave words into dawns") coherent in voice, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis transforms kite-meets-poet trope via feather bridge and glowing words; iridescent patterns/shifting script offer non-obvious ingenuity. Risk in fable tone heightens thematic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
