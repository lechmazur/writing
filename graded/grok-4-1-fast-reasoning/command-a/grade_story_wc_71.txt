<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in attunement to shifts, driving collection and sanctification; actions align with traits like finding deeper meanings. Interiority concrete in sensing "strange stillness" from shard, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; "inadvertently profound" reads as label without embodied tradeoffs, softening peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard discovery to object arrangement and ritual speech, culminating in CR closure ("shard of hush... key to understanding") with felt cost in newfound direction amid lingering hush. Orientation anchored early ("quiet bay in spring... shoreline"). Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bay's "quiet waters and whispering winds" selectively mirrors internal hush, constraining via displaced objects that enable sanctification; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Elias notices "subtle shifts"). Atmosphere "hushed blaze" tensions restraint and intensity, evolving to charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hidden narratives) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through collecting ("connection to the shard") and ritual ("air... shift"), narrowing to realization with agency in micro-choices. Cost legible in foreclosed aimlessness ("journey far from over" but purposeful now). No reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of sanctifying displaced to reveal quiet stories emerges organically from ritual and realization, reweighting mundane objects without statement. Final image ("houses... whispering stories") offers non-literal resonance to motivation, embracing ambiguity in "hush lingering." No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in "subtle shifts" and sacred light; voice texture hushed-poetic, modulating rhythm from observational to intense ("hush deepening"). Murmur dialogue natural, advancing sanctification without subtext overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in ritual build); density high, sentences multi-job (e.g., "shard glowed faintly... binding them"). Minor overwriting in stacked figures ("hushed blaze," "creeping normality noticer") risks muddle but purposeful for tone; "quiet/hush" near-loop in peak but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "creeping normality noticer" and "shard of hush" transforms mundane shoreline into profound ritual; orris shard's perfumer origin adds specific ingenuity. Risk in abstract profundity pays off in charged CR without gimmick.</comment>
