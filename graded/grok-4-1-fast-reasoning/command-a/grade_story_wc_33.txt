<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's loss compels high-stakes drone smuggling with embodied tension (trembling hands, held breath); contradictory hope/sorrow acts simultaneously in final watch from shadows. Interiority concrete via micro-choices like murmuring to drone. Earned endurance in temporary fix forecloses permanent heal with felt sorrow cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: activation leads to chase evasion therefore delivery and bottle-opening DC with legible temporary cost in "heavy with hope and sorrow." One tightening via patrol chase narrows options; single scene anchors early (Elias at arcade mail drop). Closure Charged Poise in envoys' handshake reconfigures divide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade and border crevice constrain tactics (evasion dive); sensory details (whirring propellers, scanner beams) selective via Elias's urgency. Bookend arcade glow charges final image, mirroring internal mending. Details tactile and POV-biased without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggle to heal promises) signaled early, tightens via chase reversal forcing crevice dive that alters tactics. Agency in remote control and drop; cost visible in drone peril and temporary sky-mend. Coherent causal pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of small acts mending fractures emerges via bottle surge and letters motif, resonant in final handshake image reweighting stalemate without moral state. Subtext in glowing bottle yearning implies living hope; avoids tidy binaries via temporary cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (wary respect for border); lyrical rhythm modulates tension (short chase sentences). Murmur natural and goal-pursuing; no head-hopping, diction character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Figurative density (e.g., "tempest trapped in amber") overwrites chase beat slightly without muddle; rhythm varies but minor synonym flicker ("flickering"). High density advances mood; clean grammar, strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman smuggling magical bottle via absent-linked drone transforms border trope; risk in temporary heal heightens stakes organically. Final arcade retreat inevitable from salvaged hope premise.</comment>
