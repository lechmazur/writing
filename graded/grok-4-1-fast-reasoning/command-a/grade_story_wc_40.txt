<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's reticence and respect for language root clear motivation, shown through trembling hand and shallow breath during study; earned bittersweet endurance at "triumph and sorrow" forecloses crystal's life with felt cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal decoding moment slightly tempers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density builds to pattern revelation; on-page CR closure via "crystal’s final echo... faint whisper of hope" reconfigures restoration premise with undeniable conceptual cost of spent crystal. Orientation anchored early in shadowed library at dawn; single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal as micro-setting constrains choices (humming, tracing) and charges final cradle/image; sensory hush, dust, creeping dawn light selectively mirror weathered internal state without catalog. Spatial coherence strong in oak desk/library progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode pattern) signaled early, tightens via coalescing sequences under Accum lens, narrowing to restoration blueprint; agency in intuitive humming forces trade-off as energy drains, cost legible in "bittersweet victory."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fragility vs. restoration of language emerges organically from echo fragments to growth pattern; final image non-literally answers via seed-for-future reweighting without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like child’s laughter avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with scholar-specific perceptual bias (sounds as puzzles); textured diction/rhythm modulates from hush to quickened heart without drift. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing revelation; rhythm varies (short hum responses, longer reflections); minor overwriting in opening "time itself had paused" but purposeful for hush pattern, no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sonically reflective chandelier crystal in post-dictionary world transforms language-loss trope via encoded growth blueprint; fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, risk in draining cost heightens stakes.</comment>
