<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Internal promises reveal contradictory impulses of recklessness vs. humility acting simultaneously; final writing earns relational change with Kael, though "language of her heart" borders on unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of voices/promises to Charged Poise closure at inkwell writing, where glow and Kael's appearance reconfigure trust with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inkwell constrains climax choice and charges final glow image; dust motes, shelves, and hum integrate selectively via Elara's linguistic bias, mirroring internal awakening without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust restoration tightens accumulatively via three promises, forcing writing agency with felt cost of admitting fear; vibration and glow cadence-shift reweights options under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Symphony motif emerges organically from ink/voices to reconfigure recklessness theme in final dialogue without moralizing; resonant "walking together" non-literally answers trust question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in linguistic noticing; dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing voices; rhythmic modulation builds to hum/symphony without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in promises beat; minor overwriting in "symphonies of truth" metaphors slightly muddles peak clarity but closure image propels cleanly without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of linguistics/redemption via truth-symphony transforms tropes; inkwell promises arc feels inevitable, with bold mythical risk heightening closure stakes.</comment>
