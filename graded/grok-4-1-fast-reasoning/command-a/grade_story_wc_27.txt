<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via stone hum to vision, but interior conflict leans summary ("felt adrift," "purpose unclear") over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphany at "She saw herself... as a spark" feels slightly unearned without prior micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wandering to hum/vision tightening; CR closure lands on-page ("She knew what she had to do") with felt cost in lingering hum amid defeat, reconfiguring adrift-to-resolute; orientation anchored early in spaceport bay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (bare feet padding cracked concrete, amber skylight glow) mirrors internal shift; stone circle and opera glasses as micro-settings constrain kneeling/raising actions and charge final image; POV bias filters through stargazer's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hum intensification and vision deepening that narrows adrift options; agency in pressing stone/raising glasses forces stance crystallization with felt cost of reigniting amid lull.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (meaning in small acts over grand victories) emerges organically from vision particulars ("shimmering thread," "quiet moments"); final image of stepping out offers resonant CR answer reweighting rebellion premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with stargazer perceptual signature (stars through decay); rhythmic prose modulates from wandering calm to visionary intensity; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (hum "grew louder, deeper"); varied rhythm passes ear test; minor overwriting in "thunderous serenity" repeat slightly dulls peak but doesn't obscure CR image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi mysticism (opera glasses unlock cosmic vision in spaceport stones) transforms tropes via barefoot stargazer's grounded quest; risk in accumulative lyric drive heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
