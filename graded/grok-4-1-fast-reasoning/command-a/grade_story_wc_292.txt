<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in honoring ancestor's bravery drives choices, with embodied dread coiling to resolve; interiority concrete but "nervously confident" labels twice without deepening tradeoffs. Final choice earned by prior discoveries, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journal clues therefore map groove therefore nail ritual therefore reversal; on-page Decisive Change in "the world shifted once more" with legible choice cost. Orientation anchored early in station/cliff/jet stream; single scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (humming walls, ozone wind, groaning station) filters through Elara's priorities, constraining path to map nexus; floor map charges closure as station solidifies. No white-room; weather pressures entry and exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse exile to honor bravery) signaled early, tightens causally via riddle-to-ritual with agency narrowing options; cost felt in uncle's "choice remains" forcing stance. One meaningful reversal at nail press suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of bravery's cost emerges organically from particulars like nail and stanzas, reweighted in ambiguous "restore or protect" choice; final calm sky offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (librarian decoding riddles); distinct texture in lyrical syntax modulates tension, brief uncle dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; elision of ritual mechanics taught early.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("trembled...tightened," dread to resolve) and elevated metaphors ("sky itself had wept," "tornado in reverse") slightly muddle peak ritual without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical weather exile via librarian/nail/stanzas transforms trope; risk in reversible ritual pays off inevitably at "legacy...no longer overlooked," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
