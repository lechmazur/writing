<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in ingenuity and relic belief drives higher-stakes building; embodied emotions like raw hands and swelling heart under pressure reveal character. Internal shift from isolation to community leadership earned via prior labor. Minor telling in "motivation was clear" slightly abstracts, but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from calls to device tone to arrivals, tightening via first traveler's appearance as pattern break. On-page Charged Poise closure in star-gazing readiness reconfigures isolation with cyclical cost legible in dimming glow. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Recurring censer foot as micro-setting constrains choices (compass for build) and charges final image. Sensory details like windswept scars and resonant tone selective via Mara's priorities. Atmosphere tensions sanctuary/prison effectively without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate loss via beacon) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through building success and arrivals forcing communal shift. Agency in scavenging/labor forecloses solitary path with felt cyclical cost in waning glow. One tightening via traveler crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical purpose amid loss emerges organically from relic glow, building, and community; final star-gaze reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in reverse migration patterns invites ambiguity without confusion. No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (skies, relic glow); diction textured and consistent. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("I followed the signal"). Rhythmic modulation under labor stress supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm avoids monotony. Minor paraphrase loop in "raw solace" repeats dulls slightly mid-build beat (−0.4). No closure artifacts; clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-guided beacon amid reverse migration transforms isolation tropes. Censer foot and cryptic calls offer non-obvious angle; risk in cyclical openness heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
