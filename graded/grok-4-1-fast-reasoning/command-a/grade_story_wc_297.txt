<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to mend the covenant is consistent and intensifies, but interiority relies on repeated labels like "anxious elation" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the placement beat; no deep flaws complicate the climax choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure at pedestal ("the eclipsed covenant began to mend"), oriented immediately in first paragraph; one tightening via hidden path suffices, cost felt in scars and ongoing journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maze hedges constrain via thorns catching cloak and shifting paths, charging final pedestal image; sensory details (whispers, glows, etched leaves) integrate purposefully through goal-directed tracing and glow-sync.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to mend covenant signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening secrets and hidden path narrowing to center; agency in placing clipping forecloses void with legible scar-cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractured worlds emerges organically via clipping-scars-maze images, resonant final clearing reconfigures premise without statement; lingering ambiguity in "journey wasn’t over" avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature tuned to visionary mysticism (glade whispers, hedge pulses); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("anxious elation" x3, "glowing" x4, heart emotions) creates minor paraphrase loops dulling peak density (-0.6); otherwise high propulsion with varied rhythm and concrete images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of root-bound fantasy quest via clipping-scars linking transforms maze trope organically; final "clipping... glowed softly in her hand" feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
