<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via letters' jolt of recognition, earning rooftop permanence; embodied emotions in "felt a jolt." Weakness: molting trait told without on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, limiting interior conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure on rooftop ("this self... here to stay"); cost legible in prior moltings' impermanence foreclosed. One tightening via letters' discovery narrows to shared purpose; orientation anchored early in city/library.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted library and rooftop city "map of scars" constrain choices as sanctuary and charge final image; sensory details (dust/time smell, creak) selective via Elias's poetic bias. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal rebuild.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge beauty from anarchy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via letters to permanence; agency in rebuilding/writing. Cost felt in chaos outside but remains somewhat abstract, no sharply foreclosed option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from poems on walls and letters; final rooftop dialogue/image offers resonant answer ("Patching is how we rebuild") without moralizing. Subtext in luminous fractures reweights anarchy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature ("streets whispered tales of decay"); voice modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing Clara's steady nostalgia.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("moon cleared the skyline"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("luminous fracture... crack through which light") but no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting poet and letters transforming library; rooftop permanence turn inevitable from particulars. Bold poetic voice risks lyrical mode without gimmickry.</comment>
