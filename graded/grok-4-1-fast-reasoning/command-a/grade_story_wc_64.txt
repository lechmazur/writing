<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weak internal contradiction; Elias's blithe curiosity lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with the final realization feeling summarized rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("intentions endure"); cost legible in frozen chess clock and silo's humming weight, but minimal tightening narrows options only obliquely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silo and damp earth constrain discovery and mirror internal states vividly; recurring stars charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode intentions) signaled early with one textural deepening via threads, but low opposition leaves escalation abstract; clock's run-down provides felt time cost without narrowing live options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of enduring intentions emerges organically from tapestry discovery; final image ("stars shimmer brighter") offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable POV with perceptual signature (frayed threads as emotions); rhythmic poetic texture modulates effectively, though occasional elevated diction borders on register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("frayed threads," "stories," "intentions") creates synonym loops across decoding beat; heavy figurative density dulls propulsion without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tapestry as emotion-map transforms relic trope freshly; synthesis of gardener's work with historical whispers feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
