<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cool-headed fisher trait grounds motivation consistently, with embodied pull in chest transliterating to actions; micro-choices like mirroring stars reveal values under pressure. Limited contradictory impulses reduce depth—no simultaneous internal conflict acts in scene. Final realization earned but lacks visible cost foreclosure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations guide walk, stars freeze into RR (Charged Poise) as goddess appears, spike reconfigures as tether with felt weight cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early by pool/garden/night. Closure cost legible in "echo remained, woven into the fabric."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (hummed vibrations, silence's symphony) filters through Kael's fisher perception, garden constrains steps via shifting waves. Recurring spike charges final image as "tether." No white-room; spatial choreography clear around pool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch echo) signaled early via whispers; tightening when stars freeze forces confrontation, agency in voicing silence narrows to harmony. Cost felt in restoration's weight, but no live option foreclosed mid-beat. Escalation via density increase under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wild/still harmony emerges organically from silence voiced into song, spike shifts from comforting weight to tether. Final image ("constellations dancing in time with the heartbeat") reweights feral lullaby without moralizing. Resists tidy binaries via untamed soothing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (listening to silence); rhythmic modulation builds to goddess dialogue's "Then listen." Natural subtext in exchange reveals stakes. No head-hopping, diction matches cool-headed idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; sensory propulsion weaves into action without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("feral, yet soothing—a lullaby sung by something untamed") during walk slightly blurs peak density, but closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound wave garden, sleepwalking stars, emotion transliteration transforms tropes into inevitable harmony. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; spike's evolution feels organic, non-obvious payoff in cosmic tether.</comment>
