<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear but summarized; interiority relies on labels like "philosophical breakthrough" without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final purpose surge lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with discovery pattern tightening to CR closure ("her journey had only just begun... her destiny") and felt cost in bewilderment-to-purpose shift; orientation anchored early; woman encounter lacks motivated causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Astral orchard and cameo integrate purposefully, with breathing trees drawing Elara and mirrors enabling breakthrough; recurring cameo charges final palm-warmth image, constraining inquiry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling cameo/orchard mystery signaled early and deepens accumulatively via realizations; woman encounter reweights knowledge with minimal agency; cost legible in purpose acceptance but no live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance emerges from cameo relic and web-of-possibilities explanation; final orchard hold offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased to mysteries; dialogue natural, goal-driven ("You've found it"), distinct voices; rhythm modulates revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel accumulatively; minor paraphrase loops in early reflections ("beautiful, inexplicable, and unsettling"); no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pistachio cameo relic ingeniously fuses absurd object with profound legacy in surreal asteroid orchard; transforms discovery trope via nonlinear web, committing boldly to premise.</comment>
