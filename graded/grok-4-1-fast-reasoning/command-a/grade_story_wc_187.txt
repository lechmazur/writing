<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's preemptively nostalgic trait drives meticulous measurements and conjectures, embodied in furrowed brow and quickened heart; final conduit realization earned through visions without unearned epiphany; lacks strong simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak moments like fog touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building observations to CR closure in final paragraph ("work far from over... urging her to listen"), reconfiguring duty with ongoing emotional cost legible in "deepening hush in her heart"; oriented early, one tightening at fog visions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog-solid wall constrains hand-press choice and charges visions with ripple/images; crystalline forecourt whispers guide perception, mirroring internal hush and evolving with dawn light in final glance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve memory signaled early, deepens accumulatively via shadow anomalies to fog visions narrowing ignorance; agency in measuring/touching forces endurance with felt wash of emotions as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting identity from memory emerges organically via shadow distortions and visions; final ascent offers resonant CR repricing her as conduit, lingering ambiguity of endless call without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with archivist perceptual signature (symbols, shadows, whispers); rhythmic texture modulates from storm hum to deepening hush, purposeful poetic diction legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory action (caliper measure, hand ripple); "deepening hush"/whisper motif purposeful without loops; minor overwriting in stacked descriptors like "liquid moonlight" doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadow-warping as deliberate memory-speaker synthesizes fresh fantasy mechanic organically from archivist task; risk in fog-solid visions heightens stakes toward inevitable conduit poise.</comment>
