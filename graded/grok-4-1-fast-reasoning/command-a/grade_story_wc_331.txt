<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in obsession with hyperbolic geometry compels geometric rearrangements, shown through precise actions; interiority embodied in "heart pounding" and scarf vibrations. Minor telling in "she believed" but doesn't touch closure choice as guardian. Contradictory impulses limited, balancing competence without strong simultaneous conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral/fractal/Möbius arrangements build density, air shifts, library trembles to doorway CR with fading-place cost legible in "edges fraying like the scarf." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via escalating patterns suffices. Closure reconfigures stakes without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library sections constrain choices (poetry spiral, science fractal, children's Möbius); sensory shifts (ink to lavender) mirror awakening. Scarf as recurring object charges final image, mending whole. Selective, POV-filtered details integrate into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken via geometry) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pattern-deepening (spiral to Möbius), narrowing to doorway with agency in arrangements. Cost felt in fading expanse forces guardian stance. One tightening forecloses non-action path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of living stories vs. fading analog emerges via geometric unlocking and memories visualized; final restored shelves reweight premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like scarf's transformation avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc ties to thematic guardian role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (eccentric focus on equations, patterns); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed to trembling. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in climax: "The library trembled."); no loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Figuratives purposeful (e.g., "kaleidoscope of words"); propulsion clear to charged ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry awakening story-realm transforms library trope organically; risk in abstract math-to-magic paid off in precise arrangements. Final guardian reconfiguration inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
