<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait labeled early but lacks embodied contradiction during repairs; final transformation feels told via epiphany summary rather than micro-choice with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with journal-to-glow tightening; CR closure via pulsing mosaic reconfigures absence with conceptual cost in "heavier with purpose," legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silt-buried arches and hand carvings constrain wading/repairs and charge mosaic payoff, with brine/decay sensory hierarchy fitting surveyor's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore dreams) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via journal wrest; raw hands show minor cost altering tactics into lightness at glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Absence theme emerges organically from journal/vanished community to glow-filling resonance, offering non-literal CR in lagoon's "whisper its gratitude" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with surveyor-specific noticing (pillars, foundations); rhythmic texture modulates well, but occasional elevated diction ("hushed blaze") nears register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Patterned "hushed blaze" motif purposeful, but paraphrase loops on absence ("hollow spaces... silence") and minor synonym churn in reflections dull peak repair density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh surveyor-as-dream-archeologist premise transforms coastal legend trope via inkwell tradition and mosaic CR; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens resonance.</comment>
