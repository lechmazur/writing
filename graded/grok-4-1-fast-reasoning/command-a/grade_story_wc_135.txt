<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to compile fragments drives consistent micro-choices like kneeling for the wood fragment and blowing the valve, with embodied reactions (trembling fingers, quickened heart). Internal conflict is mild, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; elders' dismissal feels told rather than pressuring on-page. Earned shift to purpose at end stems from discoveries, but archetype leans stock without deeper flaws complicating peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory patterns and discoveries (valve hum, wood symbols, woman's emergence) build density to Charged Poise closure where harbor exhales renewal, reweighting absences with felt purpose cost. Orientation anchors early (Elara at Ivory Harbor post-rain). Single scene coherent; no causality breaks, valve payoff earned by handling buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt/petrichor, damp sand, ocean spray) selectively filter through Elara's priorities, guiding pull to cliffs and fragment discovery. Setting constrains choices (soft ground, seaweed tangle) and charges final image (harbor exhale). Recurrent ocean roar/ spray mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile fragments into meaning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via discoveries narrowing doubt to purpose crystallization. Blowing valve forces deepening (summons woman, confirms role) with legible cost in ongoing task amid renewal promise. No major reversals needed; pressure coheres under lens without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of filling navigated absences emerges organically from fragment hunts, valve note, and harbor response, culminating in resonant final image reweighting voids as "spaces waiting to be filled." Subtext in woman's handover implies succession cost; avoids moralizing. Particulars (symbols, mist dissolution) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (harbor whispers, deliberate steps as heartbeat). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates urgency (short sentences at valve blow: "A note... echoed"). Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("You've awakened it"), distinct voices; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (read-aloud flows with varied openings); high density integrates action/sensory (valve "humming faintly... warm in her hands"). Minor overwriting in "reactively visionary" phrasing jars slightly, but no loops/artifacts dull closure; strong verbs propel (clutched, pierced, exhale).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magical archiving via valve transforms loss trope into renewal beacon, with "navigated absences" inflecting fantasy inventively. Risky lyric closure (harbor exhale) heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, particulars (petrichor patterns) memorable.</comment>
