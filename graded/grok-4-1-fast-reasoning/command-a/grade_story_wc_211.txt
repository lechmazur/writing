<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to archive emotions roots consistently in her scribe traits and intensifies via prophecy discovery, compelling her final utterance; interiority concrete in "heart quickened" and embodied "velvet disquiet." Minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene limits to strong band, as competence dominates without raw struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shaving playback accumulates to symbol-deciphering and soil-touch realization as CR closure with felt cost of "work far from over" in final lines. Orientation anchored early in garden/skyscraper; one meaningful deepening via oak symbols suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden constrains choices (paths, oak bark, soil) and charges final image of hands on soil/orchard sigh; sensory selective via "leaves rustling as if in agreement." POV bias filters ancient hum, avoiding tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover garden's memory) signaled early via silent foghorn/prophecy, tightens accumulatively through symbols to speaking "I remember," narrowing to earned reconfiguration. Cost legible in ongoing burden, but mild agency in low-struggle discoveries prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of enduring emotions emerges organically from civilization's soil-preservation to Elara's realization, resonating in non-literal orchard sigh without moralizing. Final image reweights her archive work as continuation, inviting ambiguity of ancient awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in mystical noticing ("fruit that seemed to hum"); rhythmic prose modulates from stillness to warmer air. No dialogue; purposeful compression in memory shard taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with lines like "gnarled trees heavy with fruit that seemed to hum" advancing multiple layers; rhythm varies. Minor artifact in "seemed to" repetition (4x) and "velvet disquiet" reprise dulls peak slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skyscraper orchard/orchadrian emotions-in-soil transforms trope of lost civilization; oak symbols/soil image inevitable in hindsight. Risk in surreal prophecy payoff heightens without gimmick.</comment>
