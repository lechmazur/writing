<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied guilt (gasping, trembling legs) and contradictory impulses (fabricate vs grasp morality), earning the final renunciation; micro-choices like aligning the watch reveal values under pressure. Minor label-speak ("hollow," "weight of unspoken words") dilutes particularity without fully embodying in peak memory beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: driftwood examinations build density to pattern break at clock carving/memory trigger, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure with legible cost (watch slips into sand, truth carried upward). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (salt/decay hush narrowing perception) mirrors internal fracture via purposeful details like grasping-hand carving; driftwood and terrace constrain choices (descent, alignment) and charge final soul-reflection image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quell guilt) signaled early, tightens via accumulative deepening to memory reversal narrowing denial option; agency in sifting/aligning shows endurance with on-page cost (gasping wave, dropped watch foreclosing lies).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fabrication's cost emerges organically from particulars (false lineage to surfaced memory); final terrace image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting lies' premise with tempered ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (carvings as moral metaphors); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and strong verbs propel accumulatively; figurative language dense but consistent (sea/whispers motif), no loops obscuring cause/effect. Minor overwriting in reflective beats ("gnawing tide," "crashing wave") borders coherence slip without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist premise with driftwood sifting/watch ritual transforms guilt trope; risk-taking in textural carvings-to-truth progression feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
