<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Skepticism clashes concretely with emerging supernatural evidence, embodied in wavering focus and pressing on despite faltering recklessness at the chamber approach; final closure earned via compounded need for paternal truth. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "religiously skeptical nature" slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain solid from valve discovery to clanking pursuit to wheel-turn DC, with legible emotional cost in "weight lift from her chest" at ending. Single scene oriented early; lens holds without ambiguity. Minor redundancy in shadow motifs doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "damp earth and rusted metal" and "cold stone walls" filter through Mara's explorer priorities, constraining path via jagged glass and narrowing shadows. Beaded valve as micro-setting charges climax choice and final release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of validating father's truth tightens causally via clanking escalation and lunging shadows, forcing agency in wheel-turn with faltering hesitation as felt cost. One decisive narrowing suffices; no major slips in pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of swallowed familial truth vs. skepticism emerges organically via ghost shift confrontation, resonating in final silence lifting personal weight without moralizing. Valve reprise subtly reweights doubt into acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward relics and whispers; rhythmic prose modulates from drowsy entry to sharpened crisis without leakage. Voice texture distinct in selective sensory phrasing like "beads, each one cool and smooth."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Varied syntax propels from setup to climax without loops; high density integrates action and atmosphere. Minor figurative density in "shadows twisted into shapes that lunged" risks slight overwrites but stays controlled and clear at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ghost shift trope transformed via skeptical explorer's valve-release mechanic and paternal truth quest, feeling organic rather than checklist. Fresh synthesis in relic-as-freedom-key elevates beyond generic haunting.</comment>
