<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's aromatic caution and grief embody contradictory impulses, shown concretely in hesitation before vial's pull and final uncorking with acceptance cost. Interiority particular via jasmine-rain ghost; change earned through visions. Minor diagnostic whisper from Lila ("Why do some smells make us cry?") borders therapy-speak but anchors realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vial's glow densities memory shards toward CR closure in uncorking/grieving, reweighting caution with emotional cost legible in "allowed himself to grieve." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; shards taught via first vision transition, pattern pays off. No causality breaks; micro-turn at pull suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via scents (jasmine, rain, antiseptic) mirroring grief, constraining vial choice; greenhouse's extinct blooms charge childhood beat. Shop's "crystal shadows" recur to soften in closure image. POV bias filters city hum, neon as wistful contrast; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief avoidance vs. truth-seeking) signaled in hesitation, tightens accumulatively via visions deepening scent-memory link to Charged Poise in uncorking. Agency in picking vial despite fear; cost felt in embodied grief release. One decisive density shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory's anchoring pain emerges via scent particulars shifting from haunt to acceptance, resonant in final jasmine blend without statement. Lila's whisper sets question, vial visions answer non-literally via impact realization. Ambiguity lingers in softened shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature biases toward scents; rhythm modulates from descriptive to intensified in visions ("glow intensified"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("show you the truth of your tears"). No head-hopping; diction controlled, voice wistful-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action; rhythm varies with pressure, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opener ("neon lights clashed with whispers") but purposeful tone-setter; strong verbs propel visions. Closure image clean, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh magical realism fuses lantern broker's caution with vial's scent-visions, transforming trope via extinct blooms/ultraviolet specificity. Risky shard structure heightens memory stakes organically. No template echoes; irreplaceable synthesis in grief-scent calculus.</comment>
