<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to prove sideways time drives all choices credibly, with embodied stress like "knuckles whitening" and final thaw in icy warmth earning a tempered shift; interiority concrete but dips into repetitive label-speak ("icy warmth") without deeper contradiction in peak tampering beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via lever pull → overload → fix → anomaly proof, with CR closure in data ripple and realization of physics-rewriting cost legible in "not everyone would welcome that"; single scene oriented early, one tightening forecloses easy success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Xenobiology station and nexus constrain choices (e.g., sprint to console, manual overrides), charging final image with nexus glow mirroring internal thaw; sensory details like fogged breath, whirring machinery, and creatures' glow evolve purposefully without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove theory) signaled early, tightens via overload forcing precision fix with station-failure cost; agency in lever pulls narrows options under causal lens, though climax lacks deeper moral trade-off beyond survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of discovery's double-edged cost emerges organically via anomaly proof thawing pure passion into responsibility, resonant in final nexus glance without moralizing; mentor's balance quote integrates well but borders overt in chaos beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias (theory-obsessed noticing of temporal ripple); voice texture distinct in rhythmic phrases like "dance of light and logic," modulating tension without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Propulsive rhythm varies with short crisis sentences, high density in action beats; deduct for paraphrase loops ("holographic display/projections" churn, "icy warmth" repetition) and minor figurative muddle ("time moves sideways" abstract in peak).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fringe theory proof via nexus tampering in alien station transforms mad-science trope through specific sideways-time anomaly and creature responses; risks bold in closure's quiet conceptual shift without gimmickry.</comment>
