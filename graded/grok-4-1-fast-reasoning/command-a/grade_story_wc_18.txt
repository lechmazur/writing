<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's grounded yearning drives consistent micro-choices like synchronized breathing, earning the final realization; contradictory impulses (rooted present vs. dream chase) act in workshop scene. Wanderer adds light pressure without dominating. Minor slip: interiority occasionally tells ("heart yearned") rather than fully embodies early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sextant exam to restoration/fog thinning, delivering Charged Poise closure in final orchard image ("stood at the threshold... ready to cross") with conceptual cost (fleeting glimpse, ongoing work). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog recurs as constraint (thickens, presses windows) and charges final image (thins to reveal dream world), mirroring internal shift; workshop scents/tools tactile and POV-filtered (mirror maker's precision). Recurrent frost grounds sensory hierarchy. Environment shapes climax choice (stepping out, aligning sextant).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream via recreation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through breathing sync yielding restoration/fog dissolution under lens; agency in hands/breath forecloses ruined world with felt cost (sextant fades, moment fleeting). Climax pressure coherent, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of dissolving boundaries emerges organically from particulars (fog, sextant prism swirls, orchard reveal), reweighted in final image without statement. Subtext in "boundaries... like the fog" invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (precision hands, breath-cosmos sync); voice textured, modulating rhythm in work beats. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("What do you see?" reveals shift). No head-hopping; diction POV-apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; sensory integration strong. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("glass mountains" twice, "specters") borders coherence slip but pattern-taught; no loops or stacks dull peak. Final line recharges fog motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mirror maker recreates star-gateway sextant via breath to erase fog-boundaries, transforming dream-capture trope through grounded craft. Risky poetic tone heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
