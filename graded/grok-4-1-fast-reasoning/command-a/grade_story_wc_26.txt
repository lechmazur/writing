<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover and transform the shadow roots in consistent traits like her dusk-noticing and passion for forgotten history, culminating in an earned choice with felt sorrow. Interiority shows embodied cues like the stone's weight, but abstract labels like "luminous regret" slightly dilute contradiction. Final decision forecloses destruction path with triumph-sorrow cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from footage comparison to vial discovery and transformation, landing Charged Poise RR at "the shadow began to change" with legible emotional cost in "triumph and sorrow." Orientation anchored early in library. Single scene with one tightening via manifestation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "shelves lined with books that shimmered like captured sunsets" and "air... thick with the scent of aged paper" filter through Elara's priorities, guiding to forgotten corner. Blooms' brighter glow charges final image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel shadow) signaled early, tightens via on-page manifestation surge forcing stance crystallization; agency in pressing stone forecloses threat path. Cost felt in "luminous regret" and sorrow, reweighting under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving lost hopes emerges organically from shadow's shift to sculpture, reweighting prior footage glimpses without statement; final image offers non-literal resonance on collective fears. Complexity lingers in mixed triumph-sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in transitional gazes (dusk, twilight); lyrical texture modulates rhythmically, compression purposeful in archives navigation. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("shimmered like captured sunsets," "melted into twilight") and repeated "softly deliberate" create template cadence in early beats. Density high overall; no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-vials, cloud-library, unbound shadow transforms archival trope into poignant hope-preservation; risk in poetic fantasy pays off at sculpture's inevitability.</comment>
