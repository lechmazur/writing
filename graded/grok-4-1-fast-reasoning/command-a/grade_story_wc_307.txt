<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between withholding fear and revelation impulse, embodied in trance visions of past selves; final speech earns change with felt emotional cost in "heart heavy but unburdened."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ripple patterns building trance density to on-page CR; second stone's "sharper, more defined" ripples tighten causality to spoken revelation with legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto constrains revelation by amplifying thoughts, charged in hum and starlight-reflected ripples; selective sensory details like "sycamore hush" mirror internal shift without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of withheld truth tightens accumulatively through trance confrontation of "frustrated faces," forcing agency in second throw and speech; cost viscerally felt in heart's release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of "vanishing to appear" emerges organically from ripple images and withheld fragments reweighted by final speech; resonant closure in brighter starlight avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeing ("ripples...forming images"); rhythmic modulation suits meditative intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates setting into action (e.g., stone throws propel beats); minor ripple motif repetition purposeful under accumulative lens, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backwards aging with grotto-amplified trance transforms revelation trope; risk in nonlinear memory visions heightens meditative stakes organically.</comment>
