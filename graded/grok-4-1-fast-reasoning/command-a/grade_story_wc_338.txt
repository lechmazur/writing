<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Label-speak dominates traits like "methodically curious nature" and "shielded openness," reducing embodied contradiction; interiority concrete but lacks simultaneous impulses acting in digging beat. Final reverence feels earned via prior footage comparison, but competence without blind spots or struggle limits depth. Single POV voice coherent yet generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footage comparison accumulates density to discrepancy, driving excavation to on-page discovery (DC/CR) with felt time cost ("hours turned into days"). Orientation anchored early in vault/henge. Structure fits single scene defaults; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rain-scoured walls and henge shadows constrain choices (footage shadows hint hidden, guide digging site). Sensory selective via POV urgency (grooves traced, hum felt). Final fresco glow charges image, mirroring revelation; vivid integration without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover chapel via silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via footage misalignment narrowing options to dig. Agency in frame-by-frame comparison and shovel strike; cost legible in endurance ("hours turned into days"). One tightening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of bridging known/unknown emerges organically from map-tears motif to chapel discovery, reweighted in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (altar marks, silence volumes); invites reflection via ambiguity of henge shift. Protagonist arc ties to question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (curiosity filters stones/videos); diction purposeful but occasional elevated register ("masterpiece of endurance"). No head-hopping or elision issues; rhythmic modulation supports revelation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("silence" motif overused without full payoff) and figurative density in digging ("vault seemed to hold its breath") dull propulsion slightly. Strong verbs/specifics propel; no template cadence or filter stacks in peak; read-aloud rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Transforms relic-discovery trope via map framer's video method and silence/empathy lens; fresh synthesis in henge misalignment reweighting world change. Risks lyric motif (map tears) heightening stakes; no derivative template feel.</comment>
