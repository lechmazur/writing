<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's curiosity overrides solitude in concrete micro-choices like taking the leaf and cranking the phonograph, earning his shift to connection. Lira applies targeted pressure as catalyst without stealing focus. Minor slip: bloodhound trait shown via nose but doesn't deeply complicate peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup from leaf's warmth to phonograph's "tinted light" fragments culminate in CR closure ("we’re not as far apart") with leaf's glow as undeniable conceptual cost in final image. Two clean shards with legible transition; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scrapyard's "metallic tang" and factory's "dust and faint hum" selectively filter through Elias's sensory bias, constraining his path to phonograph. Wax leaf as micro-setting charges final image, reweighting ruins as connection. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (riddle's mystery) signaled via leaf tightens accumulatively in phonograph scene, narrowing to present-focused realization with foreclosed solitude as felt cost. Agency in cranking and interpreting drives deepening; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges organically from leaf's map-veins to shared glow, reweighting wasteland premise in non-literal final image without moralizing. Particulars like "veins tracing patterns" shift meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with Elias's perceptual signature (scent-sharp, tactile hands). Dialogue sparse but natural/subtextual ("You’re the only one who can read secrets"); rhythm modulates from hushed to resonant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; sensory propulsion peaks in "needle traced the grooves" without overwriting. Final line recharges leaf motif via image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-war bloodhound decodes wax leaf via phonograph for intimacy theme transforms wasteland tropes organically. Risky mystical tint on tech feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
