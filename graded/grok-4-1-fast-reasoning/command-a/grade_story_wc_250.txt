<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Guardian's motivation and calm demeanor drive subtle actions like mirror tilt and shutter weaving, earning the stranger's change, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses or internal conflict in pivotal stranger-speech beat; archetypal silence trends toward endurance without deeper flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from stillness to shutter patterns completing constellation at closure; Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with stranger's lighter departure and star reflection as felt cost of ongoing solitary duty; orientation anchored early in dock description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Slick planks, damp echoes, and shutters constrain stranger's approach and enable weaving, charging final constellation image; sensory selection (gleam, whisper, dark water) mirrors internal states purposefully without catalog; micro-setting (dock edge, mirror) guides silent interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stranger's darkness vs. guardian's light-teaching) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through approach-sit-speak-pattern beats to hope flicker; one tightening (mirror reflection during speech) narrows to Charged Poise closure with emotional cost legible in lighter shoulders.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of light-in-darkness emerges organically from shutter patterns mimicking stars and mirror's shifting reflection, reweighting stranger's regret without statement; final constellation offers non-literal resonant answer to guardian's motivation, embracing ambiguity of subtle change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on guardian with clean perceptual bias (water-gaze, calm weaving); distinct poetic texture in syntax/rhythm modulates tension; single dialogue line natural and goal-driven, implying secret without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("silent," "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension") creates synonym loops in opening/setup beats, dulling density; overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "spiralingly calm demeanor that made them seem more a part of the landscape") risks muddle without pattern payoff; propulsion solid but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of canal guardian using dental mirror and shutters for empathetic patterns transforms mentor trope; shutter-weaving into constellation feels inevitable from established calm, heightening stakes through subtle ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
