<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel conception, but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority concrete yet leans on diagnostic labels like "rejected the false comfort of nostalgia" without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with thoughts building to physical changes and CR closure at bottle's disappearance with conceptual cost of endless wandering; orientation anchored early, one tightening via glow intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "boots crunched against the gravel" and evolving lanterns constrain choices and charge final image; setting mirrors internal shift from ghost town to revival without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reimagining (not replicating) signaled early with one accumulative deepening via visions solidifying, but lacks on-page reversal narrowing options or visible price beyond declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of creation over replication emerges organically from rejection and lanterns' glow as resonant non-literal answer; subtext in "not by resurrecting the past, but by conceiving a future" lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in alchemical recall and visions; rhythmic prose modulates effectively, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel scenes, but minor paraphrase loops around "rejected the false comfort" (repeated phrasing) dull peak reflection slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mind-alchemy reviving ghost town transforms revival trope through bottle-mind link; risk in conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
