<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as expanding circles build density to resonant reconfiguration at seed's glow and roots anchoring vortex; emotional cost legible in thawing confession on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vortex as setting constrains choices through pulling currents and cold air narrowing perception; seed charges final transformed orchard image, filtering details via druid priorities like fruit-decay scent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to heal lake/discover hidden truth tightens via vortex surge as "thousand unseen hands," forcing agency in fluid surrender with admission cost reweighting options.</comment>
