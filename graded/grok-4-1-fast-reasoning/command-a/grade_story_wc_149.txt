<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to repay debt roots consistently in betrayal memory, intensifying via embodied conflict in clutching the bead amid trembling; contradictory elation/sorrow acts simultaneously without summary. Final stance shift to hope earned by prior causal anchors like bead resonance. Minor slip in reflective backstory slightly abstracts peak kneel moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bead glow to whispers chorus, tightening to collective debt realization. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page ("stepped into the endless night") with felt conceptual cost of shared chains. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse and tree roots constrain choices (kneel/bury site) and charge final threshold image; sensory hierarchy (scent, hush, shimmer) filters through spectral bias purposefully. Recurring bead glow evolves with events, mirroring internal venom/soothe. No generic placeholders; alchemical details integrate tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment/freedom) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bead surge drawing spirits, narrowing to collective confrontation with visible emotional cost in trembling grasp. Agency in deliberate steps/kneel forecloses isolation path. Legible price charges ending poise under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of personal-to-collective debt emerges organically from bead/tree particulars and whisper chorus, reweighting betrayal in final hope image without moralizing. Subtext in venomous connection invites ambiguity on freedom's price. Resonant non-literal close ties arc to question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (whispers as chorus, light flickers) biases toward spectral hush; rhythmic compression heightens bead awakening shimmer. Stable single POV with no leakage; voice modulates intensity purposefully from drift to beacon illumination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in clutch/tremble); density high but minor metaphor churn ("mournful elation" repeats conceptually) in reflective blocks dulls propulsion slightly. No loops in closure; purposeful overwriting suits lyric texture without obscuring glow surge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ghost lore via bead's venomous resonance transforms betrayal trope into collective reckoning; risk in textural haunt payoff feels inevitable. Ending's beacon path reconfigures orchard prison organically.</comment>
