<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's motivation to interpret silence as possibility drives actions consistently, culminating in earned voice recovery at the singing beat. Interiority remains poetic but lacks embodied contradictory impulses during the oasis discovery, leaning archetypal without deeper flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (fragment, bells, oasis) build density toward Resonant Reconfiguration closure via carousel awakening and pendant image with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors early in train valley; one tightening via wrong turn suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wind bells chime, blooming flowers scent, wooden horses creak) filter through carpenter's perceptual bias, with train corridors guiding wrong turn choice and oasis charging final image. Atmosphere coheres purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming silence escalates accumulatively via warming fragment, guiding bells, and singing agency narrowing to magical release with cost in rediscovered purpose. Single deepening at climax forecloses isolation path legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence as beginning emerges organically from particulars (carousel longing eyes to restored vitality), with final pendant image offering non-literal resonant reweighting without moralizing. Subtext lingers in ambiguity of memories' weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical perceptual signature (interpreting stillness poetically); rhythmic modulation heightens under pressure at song climax without leakage. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/atmosphere, but minor overwriting in climax (stacked metaphors like "whispering gleam... tapestry of forgotten dreams") risks coherence without full pattern payoff, touching closure lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist synthesis of circus train oasis and halo awakening transforms abandonment trope via carpenter's craft, with singing turn inevitable from established pull; risks bold lyricism coherently.</comment>
