<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel code clear and musician-specific via tracing notes, but over-tidy epiphanies like "Her role was clear: she was not just an orchestra pit musician but a conduit" lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, softening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from stains to shifting patterns and humming ripple; on-page RR closure via ghost vanish and program dissolution as conceptual cost of released secrets reconfigures silence to resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (water sloshing ankles, silt-buried program) constrains choices like deeper pit advance; water ripples sync with melody charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel ghost code) signaled early, deepens via humming agency that elicits lantern brighten/water ripple under accumulative lens; forecloses silence path with dissolution cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Thresholds/music-memory theme emerges from particulars like stain-notes to final peace; resonant non-literal answer in "silence replaced by lingering resonance" reweights ruins without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with musician perceptual signature (gaps/pauses as in-between); rhythmic prose modulates to swell with melody, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("wordless conversation" reprise, "felt" stems x4) and "seemed" tics dull propulsion in build beats; density high but repetition touches pre-closure hum without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Water-damage code on program offers fresh inflection on ghost trope, transforming opera ruin into liminal conduit; synthesis feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
