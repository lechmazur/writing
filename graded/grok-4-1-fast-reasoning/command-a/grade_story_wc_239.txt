<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract and declarative with no embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; final understanding feels unearned rather than compelled by micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to CR closure with conceptual cost legible in dictionary merge and temple resonance; orientation anchored early, but associative linkages lack one decisive tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Temple's shifting walls and fluid time constrain the inward/outward journey; mural and dictionary as micro-settings charge the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling illusions signaled early but no on-page reversal or deepening under lens forecloses live options; abstract pressure lacks visceral cost legibility at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of unity emerges organically from journey particulars to resonant CR without moralizing; final harmony non-literally answers cosmic illusions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with distinct perceptual signature in hushed, mythic noticing; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative tone without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative overwriting in glowing pages beat and minor hush paraphrase loops dull peak propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mythic witness premise with dictionary key offers fresh angle on cosmic quest; risk-taking in abstract lyricism heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
