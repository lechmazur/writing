<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via legacy and perceptive trait culminates in earned reconfiguration from burden to purpose when placing the film strip; interiority concrete without stock phrasing. Mild lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from passage echoes to chamber revelation; CR closure legible in mirror window showing her journey, reweighting legacy with conceptual cost of voice-chosen role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage vividly constrains via curling tendrils and closing walls, charging final image as ivy parts brighter; sensory hierarchy (humidity, moss, hums) reflects perceptual bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping unseen dreams tightens accumulatively through diary/map discoveries narrowing to hidden chamber; agency in pressing symbol forecloses ignorance with felt legacy cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of walls dreaming remembrance emerges organically via echoing chorus to mirror's non-literal answer; final pedestal placement recharges prior particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (hearing sighs, glimpsing flickers); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in narrowing passage without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors ("ivy seemed to watch") integrated into action; varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor overwriting in opening whispers touches edge of peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh premise of walls' dreams transformed via cartographer's perceptual lens and film key; risk in abstract concept grounded yields inevitable CR hindsight payoff.</comment>
