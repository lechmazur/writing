<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority generic with stock phrasing like "trembling slightly" and no flaws complicating micro-choices; final realization reads told rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building from buttons to bone key unlocking voices; on-page CR closure via wisdom reconfiguration carries felt cost of ongoing journey; orientation anchored early in warehouse and task.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting of warehouse jars and workbench constrains sorting action and charges bone-button discovery; sensory hum/vibration syncs with internal rhythm; final cliffs reprise reweights isolation to charged possibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unscrambling echo tightens accumulatively via button mosaic to bone key reversal narrowing options; agency in methodical process forecloses ignorance with cost of perpetual guardianship legible in "work far from over."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of possibility over fate emerges organically from voices' journeys and Elara's weaving; final image of wind-whispered canyon offers resonant CR without moralizing; earned through particulars like etched symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of graceful focus; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate to swelling chorus; no head-hopping or withholding; voice coherent in poetic fantasy idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "unscramble/unscrambling" and silence motifs dull momentum slightly; high density in button mosaic but repetitive stems like "felt a surge" in peak; rhythm varies well overall without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of buttons as memory threads unlocking echo wisdom transforms relic-trope into textured prophecy engine; risk in fluid-time lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight from warehouse particulars.</comment>
