<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clara's curiosity roots consistent traits and micro-choices like approaching the mailbox, but the final purpose realization feels slightly unearned, bordering on therapy-speak epiphany without deeper internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain from locket warmth to key discovery and mailbox opening; closure lands as DC/RR in reading the letter aloud, with emotional cost legible in the courtyard's sigh and Clara's steady voice amid swirling emotion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like jasmine scent and metallic clang integrate purposefully, with mailbox as recurring object constraining choices and charging the final reading; courtyard evolution mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the locket's story tightens via Mrs. Ellis's revelation of worthiness, narrowing options to using the key; agency in inserting it forecloses inaction with felt emotional cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening's healing emerges organically from letter's forgiveness and Clara's realization, but Mrs. Ellis's lines like "listening is the only way to heal" verge on explicit moralizing, softening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward objects' stories; dialogue natural and goal-driven, with Mrs. Ellis's wise idiom distinct from Clara's whispers; rhythm modulates effectively under rising curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but opening's "painted the vibrant courtyard in hues of gold and amber" shows minor overwriting; no loops, clear syntax supports causal flow to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mailbox-locket mystery transforms tropes modestly through thrift curator angle, but core premise of hidden key and healing letter feels familiar without bold risk or fresh synthesis.</comment>
