<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to save Luminara is consistent and intensifies, rooted in her role, but interior conflict and embodied emotions are summarized rather than dramatized in micro-choices; Vorin's encounter applies pressure but lacks relational crucible depth. Limited contradictory impulses shown on-page weaken the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as graffiti discoveries build density to festival closure (Charged Poise via stone placement with ongoing fight cost legible in "fight was far from over"); one tightening at festival suffices, but summary shards dilute causality over dramatized beats. Orientation anchored early in raft city description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "patchwork of barges" and "swirling pattern of symbols" filter through Lira's priorities, subtly guiding graffiti trail choices; recurring sea/raft anchors constrain community stakes without white-room vagueness. Festival barge contrast charges atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake against gentrification signaled early, escalates accumulatively via resistance and festival disruption narrowing options; agency in rallying via graffiti culminates in earned stasis with felt cost of "fight far from over." No reversal, but one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed identity vs erasure emerges organically from graffiti origins and stone finale reweighting dual allegiance without statement; resonant CR in final image shifts "hopeful desperation" tone non-literally. Avoids moralizing, embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (orderly decoding graffiti); voice texture distinct in rhythmic descriptions like "sun dipped below the water, casting...amber and gold," but limited dialogue (Vorin line natural/subtextual). No head-hopping; diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Good density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in descriptions (e.g., "warning, a call to remember" echoes stakes) and summary telling in delving/resistance dull momentum; no closure-touching artifacts. Clean mechanics overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft-city gentrification via graffiti cipher and stone talisman transforms community trope organically; festival turn feels inevitable from pattern. Bold perpetual-carnival setting risks pay off in closure charge.</comment>
