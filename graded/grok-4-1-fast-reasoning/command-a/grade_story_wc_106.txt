<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira's quietly savvy trait drives flower-reading and rearranging micro-choices under trap pressure, earning her final acceptance of the jar with felt hesitation ("Lira hesitated"). Elara applies relational pressure, revealing shared yearning that forces Lira's shift from thief to seeker. Minor telling in motives ("motives hidden beneath a veneer") slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oriented early (emerald station, Lira's target by para 2); causal chain from climb → flower trap → rearrangement → panel reveal → jar handoff holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("she felt a shift within herself... a thief no longer"). Revelation of jar as "piece of someone’s soul" deepens stakes with Elara's visible cost. Single scene fits scope; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clock tower's "cold stone," glowing jar, and floral trap constrain choices (ivy as "way out") and charge final image (jar's light "mingled with the moon’s"). Sensory details (ethereal patterns, soft chime) filter through Lira's priorities, evolving with action. Moonlight subtly mirrors internal longing, grounding poetic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (jar for destiny's path) signaled early, tightens via flower-trap reversal Lira agencies through reinterpretation, deepening with soul revelation that narrows options to wise use or refusal. Elara's admission forces stance crystallization; cost legible in mutual letting-go ("time to let it go"). Pressure coheres accumulatively to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of illuminated moments as guides vs. anchors emerges organically from jar's dual nature and Lira's shift, resonating in non-literal final image ("jar’s light mingled... casting her in a glow"). Subtext in flower codes and Elara's bittersweet smile invites ambiguity without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from seeking/letting-go tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Lira's perceptual bias (recognizes flower codes immediately); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in dialogue ("You’re not what I expected"). Subtext-rich lines advance goals (Elara's challenge met). No head-hopping; diction fits savvy thief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency (short sentences at chime freeze); density high, integrating setting into action without loops. Minor overwriting in descriptors ("luminous disbelief," ethereal patterns) borders purple in peak reveal but doesn't obscure closure. No scaffold or template cadence; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of portrait-thief trope into flower-code savvy and soul-jar premise transforms heist into resonant seeker arc; flower trap and ivy escape feel inevitable from established pattern. Bold poetic risks (moonbeams as soul) heighten stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
