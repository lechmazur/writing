<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's reluctant duty and traveler-guiding impulse drive the pivotal rescue and planting, earning her purpose shift with embodied tension in dodging birds; internal conflict leans told over simultaneous impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from nut impressions to map-rescue-planting culminates in on-page DC (bud emerges, ground trembles) with legible cost ("curse wasn’t broken, but weakening"); lens holds, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Labyrinth and birds constrain rescue choices (dodging whirring wings, alcove hide) and charge final orchard image; sensory details (gravel crunch, biting frost) weave purposefully through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant curse-breaking stake tightens via nut-map agency, escalating bird pursuit with felt risk; cost visible in self-endangering sprint and weakened-but-unbroken curse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of purpose amid curse/graceless beauty emerges organically from nut bud and bird "graceless yet precise" image, reweighting reluctance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (nut's shifting lines, glowing warmth) and rhythmic texture modulate pressure; minimal dialogue natural in "Follow me."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated sensory action; no loops, minor overwrought phrasing ("offhandedly exact") doesn't muddle closure bud image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nut-as-blueprint key transforms cursed orchard trope into fresh causal engine, with mechanical birds' functional beauty risking bold synthesis tied to closure.</comment>
