<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation deeply rooted in personal factory loss, compelling archival actions with embodied calm; interiority concrete via petal-brushing and photo-arranging, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from field entry to closure CR ("heart lighter... quiet hope"), with undeniable conceptual cost in pain-honoring process; orientation anchored early, structure fits single-scene default perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lavender scent and vine-climbed ruins constrain her kneeling/work and charge final image of embraced resilience mirroring internal healing; sensory details selective through archivist bias, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of story-recovery signaled early tightens accumulatively via photo-timeline deepening knowledge of lives; personal cost felt but lacks agency-testing reversal narrowing live options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory-honoring emerges implicitly from photo-weaving amid ruins/field contrast, resonant in final reconfiguration without moralizing; subtext in vines' whisper-to-embrace shift avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature attuned to "fragments" and "arcs"; rhythmic prose modulates gracefully, diction purposeful in archivist texture without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath (short dusk-shadow sentences propel to close); high density in integrated sensory/action lines, minor paraphrase loop in "lavender field" repeats dulled propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh archivist angle on industrial decay via photo-arcs transforms healing trope organically; earnest whimsy in vine-resilience synthesis feels inevitable, bold without gimmick.</comment>
