<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as historian of small gestures anchors her arc with concrete kinship to chessboard, but final unbinding feels diagnostic ("luminous absence") without fully embodied contradiction acting in scene. Kael applies pressure via probing dialogue, revealing his ruthless benevolence subtly. Minor epiphanic summary dilutes peak cost legibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers, chessboard tracing, and walking pattern builds to CR closure where chessboard reconfigures interregnum as possibility with felt cost of facing pain. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by ~100 words. No causal breaks; micro-turn in walking syncs stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains via echoes harmonizing with steps, charging final image; chessboard as micro-setting prompts tactile tracing that mirrors internal state. Sensory selection (whispers softening) reflects Elara's liberation. Spatial choreography clear in gallery sections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind from roles) signaled early, deepens texturally via walking words spelling emotional progression, forcing stance crystallization with cost of self-confrontation. Agency in joining steps narrows options. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures emerges organically via Elara's tracing and walking, reweighted in self-realization without moralizing; chessboard shifts from absence to potential. Subtext in Kael's faint smile implies relational ambiguity. Final image answers via non-literal symbol, lingering without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with perceptual bias (kinship to shadows); dialogue subtextual ("not every piece necessary") pursues goals. Voice texture distinct in rhythmic echoes, modulates with intensity. Clean free indirect without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("felt a... seemed to") and mixed metaphors ("nomadic penumbra") in reflective beats dull propulsion (-0.6 artifacts). Varied syntax supports ear test. No closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whispering gallery walking words and crisis actor in interregnum transforms symbolic absence into earned possibility. Risky conceptual layering (luminous absence) heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
