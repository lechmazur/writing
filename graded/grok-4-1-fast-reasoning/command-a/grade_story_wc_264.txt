<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sparse interiority lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation clear but untested by flaws or simultaneous impulses. "Freight guard" trait inert beyond initial scan. Final realization feels told rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from dune whisper to archive ignition, culminating in Charged Poise RR where shelves rearrange and role reconfigures with felt hope/cost. Orientation anchored early ("edge of the glowing dune"). No causality breaks; clock's tick marks legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (sinking boots, swirling vortex) constrains choices, e.g., sand guides path and responds to charm. Recurring light/orbs charge final diverging sparks image. POV bias filters post-fire desolation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate sparks) signaled early, tightens via dying archive needing clock—one deepening sufficient under accumulative lens. Agency in charm/clasp forecloses isolation path; cost felt in surge and role shift. Minor abstractness in stakes before archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile possibility emerges organically from embers-to-divergence arc, reweighted in final shelves rearranging without moralizing. Sparks motif accumulates resonance, tying cultivation to protection. Invites ambiguity on futures' cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (mystical noticing of pulses/whispers); rhythmic modulation builds to humming clock. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression legible under textural lens. "Occasionally everywhere" jars slightly but voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak (e.g., "glowing sands swirling... vortex of light") borders figurative muddle; "gaze occasionally everywhere" opaque phrasing dulls early propulsion. No loops; strong verbs propel to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire mysticism with archive/clock/charm transforms tropes; diverging sparks offers non-obvious inflection on hope. Risky surrealism (wave functions, frozen clock) heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
