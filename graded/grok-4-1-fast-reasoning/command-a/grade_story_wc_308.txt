<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in traits like harmonic skimming, but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority concrete yet leans abstract without embodied conflict. Final endurance of inward journey feels partially earned but unmotivated by prior struggle. Epiphany at "Kael’s heart swelled with understanding" borders on unearned without micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anticipation to flock patterns coalescing into CR closure. Orientation anchored early in Canyon details. Cost legible in final inward reconfiguration "to become one with the pulse," foreclosing external paths with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (whispers, hums, shadows) mirrors internal stillness; towers constrain waiting and charge final image of blending into shadows. POV bias shapes notice of rhythms/dust. Environment guides choice without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraise arrowhead) signaled early; accumulative escalation via pattern deciphering narrows to realization, driven by Kael's focused agency. One tightening sufficient; cost in deepened resolve alters tactics inward. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stillness/motion emerges organically from bird patterns revealing arrowhead's inner compass; final image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Subtext in silent recitation charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature in rhythms/pulses; syntax/rhythm modulate intensity purposefully. Single POV clean, no elision issues. Texture distinct and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative language consistent in taught poetic mode without muddle. Minor repetition ("resolve," "weathered") purposeful, no loops dulling propulsion. Closure image clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone skimming, bird augury, bone towers transforms mystic tropes via textural accumulation. Poetic risk heightens stakes organically. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
