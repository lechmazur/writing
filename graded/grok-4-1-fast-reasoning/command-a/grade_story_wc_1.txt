<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Adaptive trait shown concretely in frost-pattern retracing mirroring glass work, earning final resolve to rescue; lacks contradictory impulses or flaws driving mistakes, yielding smooth competence without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of discoveries tightening to grotto revelation (full ledger, apprentice captive); Charged Poise closure reconfigures purpose with legible relational cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost patterns and canyon resonance constrain retracing choices and charge final campfire image; sensory details (icy designs, bioluminescent moss) vivid and POV-filtered through artist perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover purpose/truth) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via caches to grotto; mild pressure with no on-page opposition or reversal narrowing options beyond knowledge gain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in fragments emerges organically from ledger shards, frost patterns, and glass motifs shifting to resilience; final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (light/pattern obsession); rhythmic prose modulates poetically yet legibly, suiting accumulative lyric mode without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High figurative density ("shadows danced, silence hummed") borders overwriting in reflective beats, with minor paraphrase echoes (e.g., "scorched testament"); propulsion clear but rhythm varies unevenly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artistry, frost-led tracking, and ledger fragments transforms ambush-recovery trope; canyon resonance and biolum grotto feel organic and memorable.</comment>
