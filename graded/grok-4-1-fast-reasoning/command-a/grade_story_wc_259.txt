<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in anguished pursuit of forbidden knowledge intensifies through micro-choices like tracing bronze and whispering; contradictory impulses in obsession vs. sanity feel embodied but final realization borders on tidy without simultaneous action of both.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening at erased pattern discovery (inciting to climax), delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where pagoda mirrors inner truth with legible cost of eroded innocence reframed as gift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pagoda and archive floor constrain choices (kneeling, whispering) and charge final image of glowing veil; sensory hues and cool bronze integrate purposefully through POV bias, mirroring internal pulse without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking pagoda via pattern-avoidance deepens accumulatively through erased tiles reversal, narrowing to whisper agency with sanity cost felt in light's purifying seep; escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia as inner mirror emerges organically from pagoda response and realization, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; anguished joy layers complexity with plausible ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (e.g., fragmented light as nostalgic atoms); rhythmic modulation under insight pressure purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density propels but overwriting with figurative stacks (e.g., "liquid gold" light in climax beat) muddles slightly; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "atoms of nostalgia" without payoff dull peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prismatic pagoda and erased-pattern insight transforms nostalgia trope inevitably; risk in steadily unpredictable archive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
