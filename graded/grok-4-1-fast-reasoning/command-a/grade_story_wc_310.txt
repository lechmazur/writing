<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via coin submersion, but interiority relies on labels like "quietly enthusiastic demeanor gave way" without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the distillation climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from preparation to distillation burst and coin submersion CR; orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "hands trembled slightly" foreclosing doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ambered glass and rusted metal constrain actions and charge final light burst; sensory hum and reflections mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alignment) signaled early tightens accumulatively via essence reflection changing knowledge; agency in deliberate dial adjustments and coin choice; cost felt in heavier decision pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of contraction-as-beginning emerges via prophecy unfolding in essence images; resonant non-literal close in "beacon of hope" reweights fragments without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward cosmic patterns; rhythmic modulation peaks in "deafening and silent" burst; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in Lira's reflections ("backwards prophecy" restated thrice without new pressure) dull mid-distillation; rhythm varies but some stacked modifiers like "shimmering liquid that glowed with an otherworldly light" border overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of contracted universe, coin relics, and reverse prophecy transforms cosmic rebirth trope; risk in lyric CR pays off in submergence image.</comment>
