<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to preserve methods drives consistent micro-choices like clutching the cog; weakness in diagnostic labels ("rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm") that flatten embodied contradiction during Lira's challenge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of visits building to CR closure ("threads in the same tapestry") reweighting narratives with conceptual cost of integration; summary over "days turned into weeks" dilutes on-page tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sewer and sunken ruins constrain extraction amid collapse, with cog as recurring object charging final image; sensory details like "scent of decay" and "damp stone" filter through Kael's relic priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (past vs. future) tightens via collapse news forcing trade-off, escalating density under Accumulative lens; hesitation clutching cog makes cost legible before following Lira.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emergent theme of narrative integration resonates in final realization without moralizing, reweighting clashes as "threads in the same tapestry"; subtext in dialogue implications avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in relic focus; dialogue natural with subtext in clashes, distinguishing voices though Kael's internal idiom dominates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("competing narratives," "clutched tightly") and repetitive stems in openings dull density; rhythm varies but some synonym churn in reflections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on post-plague hoarding via narrative philosophy and cog symbol; transforms trope through specific ruins integration without hedging.</comment>
