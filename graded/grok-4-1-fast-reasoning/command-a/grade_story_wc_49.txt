<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; Elara's success unfolds smoothly without flaws complicating choices or embodied struggle under pressure. Motivation is consistent but told via summary ("months studying") rather than dramatized micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from hum to song to transformation; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with vine-to-orbs shift and felt cost of ongoing work. Orientation anchored early in arbor at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Verdant arbor and vine tendril integrate vividly through action, constraining choices and charging final orbs image. Sensory details (glow, rustle, dew) selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore songs/remedies) signaled early with accumulative tightening via glowing/singing, but lacks opposition or reversal narrowing options; pressure remains low, success too frictionless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of stories healing emerges organically from vine/moon events; final orbs offer resonant non-literal answer to restoration. Emerges from particulars without moralizing, though low pressure limits depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with whimsical perceptual signature (goggles, humming); rhythmic prose modulates effectively, diction purposeful for fantasy tone. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive "golden" light/glow motifs and "stories" phrasing create minor paraphrase loops, dulling density in climax. Rhythm varies but overwrites slightly in transformation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (magical vine, moon rituals) transformed via tinkerer synthesis, but premise feels familiar without bold risk. Final orbs reconfiguration adds fresh inflection.</comment>
