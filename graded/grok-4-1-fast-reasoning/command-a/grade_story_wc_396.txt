<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via mirror visions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; sequential glimpses yield tidy resolve without embodied internal conflict. No micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure, like in the final mirror's unresisted ideal vision. Change feels earned but lacks genuine flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirror glimpses build density toward RR closure (crystal reforms, self-merge) with felt cost in self-confrontation ("saw her own fears, her doubts"). Orientation anchored early (orchard, fragment). One meaningful tightening via converging fragments; cost legible in "resolve hardening."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (salt/apple blossoms, aged wood/dust) integrated into action; mirrors as micro-setting constrain choices and charge final image (pedestal convergence). Orchard bookends mirror internal states purposefully. Lighthouse constrains via beacon placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstitute for balance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via self-revealing mirrors narrowing to action; agency in fragment-to-mirror choices forecloses doubt-path with cost ("moments of weakness"). Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive intensification sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (empathy-to-action mends fractures) emerges via anomaly visions and self-merge, but final line ("a reminder that empathy... could mend") borders Thematic Echo, stating moral overtly. Resonance from particulars good, yet risks sermonizing without full ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (intuitive whispers, shadow-laced lens); rhythmic prose modulates poetically (rippling mirror, humming air). No dialogue. Voice texture distinct, elision purposeful in visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful (rippling glass, floating fragments). Minor overwriting in peak ("glowed with radiant light") but doesn't obscure closure. Propulsion strong through action-embedded detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse orchard + mirror visions transform relic quest into self-empathy arc; mirrors' shifting patterns and anomaly blueprint offer non-obvious ingenuity. Tropes (crystal relic) personalized via internal mapping.</comment>
