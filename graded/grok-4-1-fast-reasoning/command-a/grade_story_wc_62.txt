<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied emotion (breath syncing with greenhouse rhythm) and contradictory impulses (impossible task vs. renewed chisel strokes); final etching earned via spectral guidance and ribbon insight, foreclosing static monument with felt cost of transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of images (butterflies, ribbon, stone) building to CR closure; "grief was not a single, static thing but a migration" reconfigures premise on-page with conceptual cost legible in "peace, not from closure but from understanding."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (humming glass panes, thick butterfly air) filters through meditative POV; workbench/chisel/ribbon micro-setting constrains carving choices and charges final stone humming with life.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape grief in finite marble) signaled early, tightens via ribbon-butterfly pattern insight narrowing to migratory etching; agency in "returned to her work" with visible cost in acknowledged impossibility, reweighting under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief as honored migration emerges organically from ribbon/flight/stone particulars, not statement; final image of folded butterfly wings offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting static loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (meditative noticing of ribbon pattern amid butterflies); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, prose-as-character reflects Elara's chisel precision without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, minor overwriting in "thundering calm" opener strains slightly but supports tone; no loops/artifacts dull closure image of humming stone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carving grief via butterfly migration/ribbon weaves transforms trope of artistic impossibility; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens meditative stakes organically.</comment>
