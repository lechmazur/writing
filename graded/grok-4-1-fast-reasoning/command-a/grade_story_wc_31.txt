<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in enigmatic pull of key and light, embodied in "tug in his chest"; micro-choices like descending stairs align with traits. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, making vow smooth but not pressure-tested; no visible flaws complicating peak commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of lights builds to CR vow on blank page with conceptual cost of lifelong quest ("journey had only just begun"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via key-book match narrows to personal vow without slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken library and water pressure constrain descent/exploration; recurring glows filter through Elias's bias, charging final pier image where lanterns reconfigure as vows. Sensory selection purposeful (whispers, pulses), integrated into action; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unnamed longing) signaled via sky lanterns, deepens accumulatively to book reveal forcing vow agency; cost legible in foreclosed ordinary life. Coherent pressure via beckoning light; one tightening sufficient, protagonist-driven under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vows as bridges to mystery emerges organically from key-book-glow progression; final image non-literally answers quest by reweighting lanterns without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; earned via struggle's absence creates quiet ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature biased to lights/pulses; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from hush to luminous intensity without leakage. Voice texture distinct in syntax (e.g., "meteor hush cradling the world"); purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, "glow" repetition pattern-taught as motif without loop penalty. Minor overwriting in stacked lights ("soft glow...drifting orbs...faint luminescence") in opening but purposeful, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lamplighter relic-key to surreal library quest transforms tropes; "color of sound" premise risks surrealism but commits fully, heightening stakes via vow's conceptual cost. Inevitable in hindsight from early pull.</comment>
