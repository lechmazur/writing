<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear via guilt tied to past fire and box, compelling acceptance; interiority concrete in scar/box parallels but slips into diagnostic labels like "bargained away in exchange for innocence." Final endurance earned by reflective causality without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Change forecloses isolation with felt cost of ongoing pain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via reflective density on box/scars, holds to Charged Poise RR closure where box gains purpose/weight, cost legible in "pain would never leave him." Single scene, orientation anchored by ~50 words (Elias on ridge with box). One tightening via feather visions reweights stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge/box constrain choices (sitting, sealing, leaving); recurring box charges final image as glowing "bridge." Sensory selective (silver glow, hum) mirrors internal via firefighter bias toward broken things. No white-room; spatial coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (process guilt via box) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through visions/note to acceptance; agency in handling/sealing forecloses carrying guilt alone. Cost unmistakable in heavier box with purpose, charging final image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming brokenness emerges organically from box/cracks/feather particulars, reweighted non-literally in final "hard softness" image answering pain's universality. Avoids moralizing; resonance from flawed endurance invites ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing broken relics as firefighter); voice texture distinct in rhythmic introspection modulating to charged poise. No head-hopping; diction fits calloused precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "he thought of" stems in reflection block create template cadence (−0.6); figurative coherent ("scars glowing faintly") but dense in peak. Density high overall, propulsion via image integration; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms trauma trope via responsive porcelain box holding sorrows; ridge/box/cracks feel inevitable, risk in lyric acceptance heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
