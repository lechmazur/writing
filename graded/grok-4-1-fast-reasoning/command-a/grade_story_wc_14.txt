<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in studious precision, embodied in quill hovering and swift writing; contradictory impulses (patience vs. racing heart) act in the charting scene. Minor tell slips like "studious nature served her well" avoid peak deduction as they don't touch closure choice. Final deepened connection earned with trembling hands as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via hum rhythms to pattern break in "resonant tone," yielding special story. Closure as Charged Poise in "tucked the notepad... ready to begin anew," reconfiguring purpose with legible intensity cost in trembling hands. Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth constrains path to "heart of the forest where the hum was strongest," charging final "trees whisper approval." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hum over town noise); evolves causally with flicker shadows mirroring anticipation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture hum histories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via insistent hum to flood of "images and sounds." Protagonist agency in charting narrows options; cost felt in "heart raced... quill barely keeping pace," charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of preserving lost narratives emerges from invented-to-memory shift; final descent with "hum still echoing" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Complexity in "not just invented... a memory" lingers via forest approval image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (hum vibrations, tree whispers); voice texture in "refracting textures" modulates rhythmically to intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "quill hovered... ready to capture"); rhythm varies, no loops despite hum recurrence (purposeful accumulation). Minor overwriting in early descriptions doesn't dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stationer charting lamp hums in bonsai labyrinth transforms surreal history-collection premise; risk in fluorescent lamp amid ancient trees heightens stakes organically. Final "rare smile" reweights particulars inevitably.</comment>
