<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism conflicts with curiosity in micro-choices like pocketing the shard despite laughter at the message, driving progression; arc to liberator earned via box's testing glow syncing with doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as breadcrumbs build density to pattern break at mirror reflection; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly when box clicks and fountain flows, reweighting city's heart with legible conceptual cost of unsticking past.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Forgotten fountains constrain path and charge final image as they awaken; sensory details like cobblestone whispers and mossy basins filter through Elara's priorities, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking box tightens accumulatively via personal changes (glow-heart sync) and mirror reversal narrowing doubt; cost felt in demanded proof of worth, charging city-scale payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of liberating trapped past emerges organically via breadcrumb inscriptions and memory-spill climax; final image of whole box as beacon offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in "realistically imaginative" lens on illusions; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically, though minor elevation jars in peak reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload ("liquid starlight," "stone lips") in opening risks coherence; minor loops like repeated "forgotten" slightly dull mid-quest rhythm without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scavenger-hunt fable with self-mirror twist transforms memory-prison trope; risk in poetic city-revival pays off via irreplaceable box mechanics.</comment>
