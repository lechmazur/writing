<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in Elara's mission, intensifying via fraying memory signs; interiority concrete in "heart steady" and "mind racing" at creature confrontation. Limited embodied contradiction or flaws complicating choices, with heroic steadiness feeling archetypal rather than struggled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dream clue leads to ridge, creature confrontation tightens via riddle, planting yields DC closure as tree withstands monsoon with felt cost of preserved memory vs. dissolution risk. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening at peak suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "blooms opening and closing as if in rhythm with her heartbeat" integrate with action, mirroring internal states; ridge constrains climb and charges final "ridge bloomed brighter" image. POV bias shapes notice of "luminous doubt."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save memory pre-monsoon) signaled early, escalates causally via creature's challenge narrowing options; agency in riddle answer forecloses failure path with legible cost in burden acknowledgment. No major slips touching climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of fantasy-reality balance emerges organically via riddle and seed's role in grounding stories; resonant CR in tree's endurance reweights memory's fragility without moralizing. Elara's direct answer line articulates thesis slightly overtly, muting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in whimsical observations like "air thick with luminous doubt"; dialogue natural and goal-driven in creature exchange, advancing proof. Rhythmic modulation supports rising pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism, varying rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "vines on a trellis" and "ink in water" in opener slightly muddles early propulsion but spares closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fresh inflections in "reality checker" role and riddle synthesize tropes, but standard quest-guardian-seed arc lacks bold transformation, feeling templated despite whimsical details.</comment>
