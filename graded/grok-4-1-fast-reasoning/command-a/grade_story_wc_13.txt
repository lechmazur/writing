<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via embodied pendant sensations and pull drives motivation, with earned change in sketchbook lightness and drawing grace; mild contradiction in seeking impossible without deeper risk aversion keeps it from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from rooftop pull to cavern pool realization (CR closure via "time...a tapestry to be woven"); cost legible in "couldn’t stay; the giant’s nap was ending"; orientation anchored early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and cavern pool constrain choices (ledge walk, pendant-to-gate); recurring infinity carvings charge final image; sensory hierarchy (warmth, scent, stillness) reflects illustrator's rhythm bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Heart via pendant) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via blurring time and gate barrier narrowing options; agency in descent/dip forecloses staying with felt cost; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinity motif shifts from key to reminder, offering resonant answer ("honoring its rhythm") to interrupted cadence without statement; emerges organically from pool realization reweighting prior flatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic observations ("interrupted cadence," "shadows that danced"); lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure; diction modulates with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "currents bending to her will"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful without muddle in peak cavern beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rooftop canals, giant's nap, time-weaving transforms tropes; illustrator's rhythms ground magical elements organically; risk in solo surreal journey heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
