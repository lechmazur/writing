<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation shifts from survival to discovery but relies on unearned epiphanies like "sense of peace, a lonesome splendor" without deep embodied contradiction; interiority generic with stock trembling fingers and deep breaths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from vial visions to temple shifts culminating in CR closure (fear to wonder reconfiguration) with felt cost of overriding solitude; one tightening via memories suffices, linkages soft but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Temple carvings and crystals constrain unsnarling choice and charge final peace image; sensory glow and heavy air purposeful, mirroring internal hush to splendor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant survival stake signaled early with time pressure tightening to discovery via vial, but escalation abstract—oxygen dwindle not viscerally felt in climax unsnarling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral beauty in solitude emerges organically from vial memories and crystal chamber, resonating in final vial-as-gift image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent literary texture, but uniform syntax and minor register drift to poetic elevation dull perceptual bias under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("gathered hush," "lonesome splendor," "unsnarl") create paraphrase churn across ending, dulling closure image; template cadence in vision descriptions adds −0.6.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Familiar trapped-explorer trope with memory vial mildly infuses ephemeral concept, but lacks bold transformation or fresh synthesis.</comment>
