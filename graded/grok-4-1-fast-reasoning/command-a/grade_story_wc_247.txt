<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in forgotten legacy compels signing choices; contradictory joy/sorrow embodied in bittersweet smile and energy spent. Interiority concrete via anchored reflections tilting present gestures. Final endurance of aloneness earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: gesture density builds to camera click as pattern break tightening stake. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (harbor, Elara, moonlight). Closure as Charged Poise/CR: silence reconfigured from empty to alive, cost in "energy spent but spirit alight" legible at final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Moonlight and camera lens refract to charge gestures, mirroring internal mapping; harbor stones "listening" subtly guides atmospheric pressure. Recurring camera as micro-setting constrains final shaping and glow fade. Sensory selection (shimmer, prisms) purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice legacy via silence) signaled early, textural escalation via hum/click narrows to shaping triumph under agency. One tightening (camera response) forecloses doubt with energy cost. Final image crystallizes trade-off: alone but meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-language emerges organically via signing-to-click progression; final harbor change offers non-literal answer reweighting emptiness. Bittersweet ambiguity lingers without moralizing. No token motifs; camera reprise charges without shouting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward silent magic (vibrations, prisms). Rhythmic prose modulates from fluid to slowed gestures matching intensity. Distinct texture in luminous diction; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Repetitive hand-action stems ("moved fluidly... danced... moved... move once more") create mild template cadence across buildup (−0.4). Varied rhythm overall, high density integrates image/action. Minor "seemed to" stacks in peak but no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language and film-less camera transforms silence trope into tangible symphony. Risky lyric buildup inevitable in hindsight; no template echoes. Bold conceptual commitment heightens quiet stakes.</comment>
