<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; stock embodiment like "heart raced" in map reveal undermines particularity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain from arrow pulse to map projection to grove insertion delivers on-page DC closure; felt cost in "journey far from over" commitment legible at final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating arches and river flow constrain navigation choices during inversion; emerald-glowing walls charge the pivotal anchoring moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens via fading echoes revelation, narrowing to grove action; pressing arrow forecloses uncertainty with agency-driven restoration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges from echo memories and chaotic growth without statement; final "planet’s song" image resonates as non-literal answer to balance question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature attuned to "planet’s whispers" and rhythms; diction modulates effectively with inversion tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in pulsing/warming descriptors dull density; strong propulsion and varied rhythm support closure image without artifacts there.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-echoes in accelerated flora transforms sci-fi tropes; gravity inversion ingeniously heightens stakes through organic constraints.</comment>
