<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in accident and vow drives polishing and final resolve to share; interiority concrete via tracing sea glass and embodied joy. Mild contradiction in resurfacing memories resolved tidily without simultaneous impulses acting in peak beat. Earned endurance of scars into peace with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: polishing and memories densify to Charged Poise closure as glass glows and memories reconfigure from burden ("no longer felt like burdens"). Orientation anchored early in grotto. One tightening via mist thickening and moonlight sliver holds to legible cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto and mist constrain solitude and charge polishing; sea glass as micro-setting evolves tactilely, mirroring internal healing. Sensory hierarchy (glow, damp scent) filters through Lira's priorities. Recurrent mist cocoons and parts purposefully without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentle light-sharing) signaled early but escalates minimally via memory deepening, lacking reversal narrowing options under accumulative lens. No live trade-off or antagonist pressure; agency in polishing endures without foreclosing high-cost path. Stakes feel abstract, resolved via epiphany over visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of light in brokenness emerges organically from mother's words and glass transformation, resonating in final sharing image without moralizing. Subtext in scars-to-resilience via polishing particulars. Tidy counter-readings absent; ambiguity lingers in "light that was both hers and not hers."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward light/glow; diction poetic yet controlled ("colors shifting like captured twilight"). Rhythm modulates from steady polishing to radiant close. No head-hopping; elision of accident backstory anchors to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in polishing focus); density high in integrated sensory action. Minor overwrite in mist metaphors ("clung like whisper," "wrapping like cocoon") risks muddle but stays voice-consistent. Rare paraphrase in memory summaries ("memories resurfaced") avoids loops; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scarred vow, sea glass polishing, and fireless light-sharing transforms introspection trope. Final "zephyr bloom" inflects gentle triumph organically. No template echoes; risk in lyric closure heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
