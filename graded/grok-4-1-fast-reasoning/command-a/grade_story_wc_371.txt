<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in gardening actions, but interiority tells via summaries like "motivation was simple yet profound"; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in plaque scene, leaning serene without peak stress degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from bread to plaque discovery as meaningful deepening; charged poise closure in tea house crystallizes fragile peace as legible conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (damp earth, bread warmth) filter through Elara's noticing bias and guide gardening choices; plaque as recurring micro-object charges closure image under courtyard/tea house anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Gentle accumulative pressure signals quest early and tightens via plaque deepening, narrowing to endurance of fragility; cost felt in "fragile, this feeling" but lacks agency-driven trade-off beyond persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in ordinary emerges implicitly from gardening/plaque events, with final tea house image as non-literal resonant answer reweighting decay-to-renewal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in subtle shifts (bread in flowers); rhythmic prose modulates serene texture effectively, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory without loops, varied rhythm propels accumulative beats; minor courtyard repetition purposeful but borders redundancy in reflective passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening in ruins with vanishing bread transforms renewal trope organically; plaque discovery as fresh inflection grows from particulars, committing to quiet lyric risk.</comment>
