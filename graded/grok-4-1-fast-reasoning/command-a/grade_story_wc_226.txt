<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in rebellion drives her to the spire and final declaration, with embodied emotions like trembling voice and pounding heart; however, interior conflict relies more on stated poetry than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, diluting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as poetry accumulates density in mist/echoes toward CR closure ("path forward—one she would walk alone, but unburdened") with legible cost ("shard of her heart"); orientation anchored early in bone towers/canyon; single tightening from shadows suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "cold, damp stone" and swirling mist integrate purposefully, with spire/canyon constraining her ritual choice and charging final image of parting mist/path; POV bias filters through artist's eye without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract forgiveness) signaled early tightens via poetry-shadows-deepening under accumulative lens, with agency in continued recitation foreclosing burdened path; cost felt in heart-shard realization, though one escalation suffices without micro-turn overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness's price emerges organically from refracted poetry/shadows into resonant CR final image without moralizing; poetry lines like "shattered mirror" border overt statement but earn through struggle, reweighting prior echoes non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct poetic texture/rhythm matching defiant artist, modulating from soft lilt to urgent declaration; perceptual signature in refracting mist/echoes biased toward artistic longing; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in glow/shadows beat; however, figurative density in opening ("skeletal fingers," "forged hush") risks overwrite without pattern payoff, and minor echo-repetition loops in mist descriptions dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic refraction in bone-tower world transforms forgiveness trope through spire's soul-bending logic, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes organically; final path image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
