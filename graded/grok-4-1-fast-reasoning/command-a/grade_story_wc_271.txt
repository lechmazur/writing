<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like heart slowing and inching forward during the cliff slip, reveal trauma-honed traits; final sketching endurance earned by prior causality with felt cost of unhealed grief. Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing ("a pearl of stillness amidst the storm") borders therapy-speak but stays grounded in somatic response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wind snatch incites, cliff teeter deepens density, sketching/sketchpad-left closure lands Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of enduring pain legible in "not healed, not entirely." Orientation anchored early in arboretum/cliff; single scene causality tight, no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (salt/jasmine wind, crashing waves) mirrors internal chaos/tranquility and constrains cliff-edge choice; recurring cliff charges final ocean image. Lighthouse keeper legacy subtly guides thematic endurance without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve photo amid trauma freeze) signaled early, tightens via slip narrowing options; somatic agency forecloses fall-path with visceral cost in teetering flashback. Accumulative escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Resilience-in-loss theme emerges organically from photo chase to sketching reprise, final smile offering non-literal answer; ambiguity lingers in partial healing. Minor overtness in "anchor optimism in realism" line slightly undercuts subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with trauma-biased perceptual signature (somatic details, grief-filtered beauty); rhythmic modulation heightens cliff tension to sketching poise. No dialogue; voice distinct without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from wander to cliff crisis; minor paraphrase loop in "pearl of stillness" repetitions purposeful for motif, not scaffold. Clean syntax, no heavy artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via somatic cliff peril and arboretum resilience transforms survivor trope; photo-sketching turn inevitable from setup. Bold risk in quiet CR closure heightens without gimmick.</comment>
