<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in underachieving traits, driving perseverance at climax with harness use; embodied panic ("trembling hands") grounds emotion. Internal conflict present but leans summary ("efforts often ended in failure"); epiphany at keystone touch feels slightly unearned, told over shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: trap triggers harness/mist walking, leading to keystone touch and RR closure (clarity surge reconfigures belief). Orientation anchored early (Eli in spire); cost felt in effort/risk, legible in emergence before pedestal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Icebound spire vividly sensory (breath crystallizes, footsteps echo), constraining choice (ice outcropping anchors harness). Glow evolution mirrors internal shift, charging final descent image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove manual magic) tightens causally at trap ("walls began to close in"), forcing agency via mist walking; visible cost in weightless risk alters options, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of heart over automation emerges organically via perseverance, but final paragraph moralizes ("sacred... in the simplest of acts"), triggering -0.6 penalty; resonance diluted by direct statement replacing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable, perceptual bias mage-specific (forgotten arts); rhythmic control modulates tension in mist step ("weightless... sea of brilliance dimness"). No dialogue; minor generic phrasing under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Solid propulsion, but "lingering luminance" loops 4x without payoff (-0.4); "brilliance dimness" muddles twice in climax, dulling image. Density high otherwise, no heavy scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated magic vs manual heart, transformed via mist walking/keystone; risk in "impossible geometry" pays off without gimmick.</comment>
