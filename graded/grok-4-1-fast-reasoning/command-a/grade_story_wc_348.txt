<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority ties grief to polymer metaphors, embodied in chrysalis handling and foam observation; micro-choices like crouching and walking deeper reveal values under pressure. Earned change via insight forecloses isolation with felt cost of integration. Minor tidiness in epiphany slightly undercuts contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure in "the world felt different—not perfect, but whole," reweighting grief with undeniable integration cost shown in purposeful climb. Single scene oriented early; no shards or transitions violate defaults. Waiver on any disorientation as foam/chrysalis pattern pays off precisely at ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>River foam and chrysalis as micro-settings constrain insight choice and charge final image, mirroring internal separation/reconnection. Sensory details (foam swirl, damp earth scent) selective via chemist's perceptual bias, evolving with twilight shift. No white-room; spatial choreography clear in crouch-to-climb progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief-to-connection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via foam insight narrowing options to integration. Agency in embracing change forecloses escape path; cost legible in "weight of loosened grief" persisting as guide. No reversal needed under lens, but internal pressure coheres without abstract drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of separation-to-connection emerges organically from polymer/river/chrysalis particulars, resonating in final chrysalis reprise without statement. Subtext in foam's "chaotic beauty mirroring turmoil" invites ambiguity on grief's full integration. No moralizing; counter-reading of ongoing ache lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with chemist's perceptual signature: "symphonically attuned to molecular bonds" biases noticing of foam patterns. Voice texture modulates rhythmically from turmoil to poise; no head-hopping or withholding. Prose reflects embodied mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., foam observation advances plot/atmosphere/character); varied syntax propels to closure. Minor metaphor density ("weave the pieces," "symphonically minded") purposeful, not overwriting in reflective mode. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling insight beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer grief via nature's foam/chrysalis transforms introspection trope; divergent insight feels inevitable from established perceptual bias. Bold lyric risk in single-scene reflection heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative templates; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
