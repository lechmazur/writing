<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to anchor ideals intensifies through chipped resolve and voice-break speech, earning the signing with felt personal cost; contradictory weariness versus hope acts in negotiation persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (celestial dance, clipboard scars) tightening to silence and signing as Charged Poise RR; cost legible in final terrace image reconfiguring fragile peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details (jasmine, fires, ink stains) selectively mirror internal states and constrain via terrace vantage/ritual; clipboard as micro-setting charges final image, narrowing reflective choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end war) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through grueling talks to voice-break reversal forcing crystallization; agency in speech forecloses failure with her eroded ideals as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Emergent theme of redemption's price via particulars (treaty ink, chipped ideals), but speech line "The price of redemption..." delivers overt Thematic Echo in climax, replacing subtext with statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (war-weary lens on beauty/flaws); rhythmic modulation peaks in voice-break dialogue, natural and subtext-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but repeated "slow dance of celestial bodies" creates minor template cadence across beats; no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transforms peace-negotiation trope via clipboard's scarred evolution and ritual descent; fresh synthesis in flawed beauty payoff, but inspirational arc hedges bold risk.</comment>
