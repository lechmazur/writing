<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in dissatisfaction with mechanical precision drives concrete micro-choices like counting backwards; embodied realization ("heart pounded") earns change, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-building discoveries (inscription to scroll) yielding on-page CR closure ("understanding...would never be the same") with conceptual cost in reweighted time perception; single scene causality tight, orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection ("fjord quiet" pressing ears, mist clearing) filters through Elias's priorities, subtly guiding gaze to horizon in charged final image; recurring clock constrains handling and revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (true measure of time) signaled early accumulates via pattern break in scroll discovery, narrowing to renunciation of precision; one tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens, but low external pressure limits visceral cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's "spaces between" emerges organically from particulars until scroll's direct statement ("Time is not measured in seconds...") triggers Thematic Echo penalty, replacing resonant image with articulated moral in final act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (clock/history focus) and rhythmic modulation under realization; diction controlled, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure, but minor paraphrase loop ("squinted" twice early with brow/notch) and repetitive "razor edges" echoes dull a high-pressure beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of horizon station and clock philosophy transforms time trope via peculiar key's grounded discoveries; risk in abstract quest pays off in hindsight inevitability.</comment>
