<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to understand names intensifies through hesitation at furnace, with embodied fear and resolve; internal conflict shows in contradictory pull of coin versus fear, but lacks deeper flaw-driven mistake before visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with vision density tightening to CR closure ("the coin now still... her own zodiac sign"); orientation anchored early; cost legible in softened regret carrying forward as reminder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Foundry's furnace mouth constrains pivotal choice to step inside, charging visions; sensory details (damp metal, herbs) filter through alchemist bias, evolving with flames to moonlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem coin/names) signaled early, escalates via agency in confronting furnace under Accumulative lens; one tightening (visions force stance crystallization) with felt cost in confronted regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of balance/redemption emerges organically via kintsugi flask and coin's reconfiguration, resonant in final image of stars as "fragments of a greater whole" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (mystical harmony in noticing coin's pulse, furnace hum); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Smooth propulsion with varied rhythm, but "luminous regret" loops thrice dull closure image slightly (−0.6 artifact); high density integrates setting/action without major scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of zodiac mysticism and kintsugi philosophy transforms tropes via coin's visions; risk in furnace-step yields inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
