<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation as death certificate survivor compellingly drives collecting and final guardianship realization; interiority particular through pattern-seeing but edges into abstract epiphany without full embodied contradiction at peak letter moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering discoveries (label to container to letter), with CR closure in "texture of memories... in the act of remembering itself," legible cost in echoed namelessness; orientation anchored early in port labyrinth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Containers and tides constrain movement and supply relics, charging final moonlit pause; selective sensory details (salt air, crane hum) mirror internal layering without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming erased histories tightens texturally via container discovery deepening self-echo; cost felt in letter's desperation but lacks agency-driven narrowing beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from fragments to letter, resonant CR in final symphony image reweighting quest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature of filtering patterns/whispers; lyrical diction consistent, modulates to charged poise at close without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety supports textural build, high density in image integration; minor "layered" loops purposeful but paraphrase echoes in discovery beats dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glitch-survivor as memory guardian transforms port maze into erasure archive; container symbol and poison label reprise risks bold lyricism heightening stakes.</comment>
