<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction via self-deception about garden's futility, embodied in gnarled hands and deliberate polishing; final realization earned through ritual buildup. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "mended deception" reflection, bordering on unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds from discovery to daily placement, tightening to CR closure where final marble placement reconfigures self-doubt with acceptance cost. Orientation anchored early in estate/garden; time elision legible via "days turned into weeks."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden maze vividly filters Elias's priorities, with vines/marbles constraining ritual choices; final image of marbles at maze heart charges closure. Sensory selectivity sharpens paradox (vibrant blooms amid flaws); no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (prove value to garden/self) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual response (garden "alive"); cost felt in acceptance of flaws. Lacks sharp reversal, pressure mostly reflective rather than narrowing live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience in flaws emerges organically from cracked marbles/garden parallels, reweighted in final whisper without moralizing. Resonant CR ties to realization; ambiguity lingers in paradoxical beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with garden-biased perceptual signature (vines as "tapestry of flaws"); rhythmic modulation suits reflective intensity. Voice distinct in deliberate syntax mirroring Elias's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid images (marbles casting "tiny rainbows"); rhythm varies naturally. Minor paraphrase loops in reflection ("cracks...flaws," "not as flaws but markers") dull two beats; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck, cracked marbles as resilience symbols, and garden reciprocity transforms introspection trope. "Fortuities" quirk adds non-obvious angle; risk in quiet CR pays off.</comment>
