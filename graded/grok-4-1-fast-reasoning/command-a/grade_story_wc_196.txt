<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to magnify kindnesses roots actions in her broken past, intensifying to the earned purpose shift; contradictory hope vs. fracture embodies well in "heart quickening" and trembling fingers. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphany ("found her purpose") avoids deeper deduction as embodied cost lands at close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust/button discoveries build density to CR closure where room reconfigures from sorrow to sanctuary, cost felt in "mend her own brokenness." Orientation anchors by para 1; one tightening via letter match suffices, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust patterns and sagging shelves constrain method and charge final shimmer image, mirroring internal shift; sensory selection (old paper smell, grime) purposeful through archivist bias. No white-room; evolves causally to "sanctuary."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake to find meaning tightens texturally via relic links, narrowing to write-or-not with agency in piecing; cost legible in kinship realization foreclosing isolation. One deepening suffices under lens, charges poise at draft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of small kindnesses bridging loss emerges organically from relics to Elara's arc, resonating in dust-shimmer without moralizing; final image reweights fragments non-literally. Complexity in endured separation avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with archivist perceptual signature (dust as storyteller); rhythmic modulation builds to lighter heart. No dialogue; compression in discoveries purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image; minor paraphrase loops ("story of... story of") in reflective beats but no closure touch or template cadence. Rhythm varies, vivid specificity replaces generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dust-pattern method transforms lost-child trope freshly; button/ribbon synthesis feels inevitable from particulars. Risks archival forensics organically without gimmick.</comment>
