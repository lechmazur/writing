<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to collect burdens intensifies through embodied conflict, with grip on lamp revealing contradictory hold to purpose; shift to self-weaving earned by figure's challenge. Interiority concrete via soul calcification and fissure. Minor abstraction in "shingled hush" slightly dilutes without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of emotional threads builds to RR/Charged Poise closure in "patterns were different... for herself," reconfiguring purpose with felt soul-crack cost. Single scene anchored early (grotto, Elara, snowmelt). Figure's arrival one decisive tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bronze grotto's metallic tang, starlight mosaic, and lamp constrain choices—lamp grounds against figure, pulses mirror breathing, brighter flame charges final self-weaving image. Sensory selection POV-specific, urgency-narrowed. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose vs. self-burden) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via figure's "Purpose can be a trap" into choice, narrowing to self-weaving renunciation with legible opportunity cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of burdens as self-trap emerges organically from calcified soul and weaving shift, final image resonant non-literal answer to "understanding begins with myself" without moralizing. Subtext in figure's hand and smile implies ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in fractal patterns and emotional embodiment; voice texture distinct via "whalebone reverie," modulates rhythmically to closure poise. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (questioning purpose), idiom distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to closure; minor figurative density ("fractal map," "shingled hush") consistent in poetic voice without muddle or loops in peak beats. No scaffold; precise syntax in choice moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-weaver premise synthesizes poetic fantasy organically; risk in boundary-less trap and soul-weaving payoff feels inevitable, transforming purpose trope via specific calcification and self-turn.</comment>
