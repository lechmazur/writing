<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eliara's methodical traits constrain cautious actions like preparing soil before planting, but interior conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous impulses in pivotal seed-planting moment; final peace earned through nurturing persistence with felt cost of prior void lightened.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as seed planting surges energy and visions, tightening to tree growth and fruit-plucking CR where understanding reconfigures ambitions with emotional cost legible in "bridged the gap"; orientation anchored early, one meaningful deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's hum and shimmering energies selectively constrain choices like planting in prepared soil and mirror internal growth in branches reaching sky; recurring glow motifs charge final fruit image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding transition signaled early via mentor's clues, escalates accumulatively through planting reversal flooding visions that deepen knowledge and force nurturing commitment; plucking bears agency with cost of "haunted ambitions" reconfiguration felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as lived connection emerges organically from seed patterns paralleling cuneiform and tree's growth; final fruit-plucking image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting transition physics without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature biased toward pulsing symbols and visions; rhythmic prose modulates from precise translation to surging energy in arbor-thickening beat, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose propels with varied rhythm and sensory integration into action, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "glowing/shimmering" in growth beats dull density slightly without touching closure; high info density in visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform translation and knowledge fruit growth transforms tropes into organic pattern of analogical insight; risk in spirit-guided visions pays off in inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
