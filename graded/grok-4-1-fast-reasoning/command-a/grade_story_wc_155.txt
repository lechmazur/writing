<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to rediscover joy roots consistently in her drained passion and unused vials, compelling the climax painting; interiority particular via artist gaze on fresco but slips into abstract epiphany ("her art had never truly been about the pigments or the canvas") without embodied contradiction acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with fog-parted discoveries linking fresco to film to network projection as tightening density toward CR closure where painting reconfigures joy with emotional cost legible in "tears streaming down her face"; orientation anchored early in ruins/fog; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog as micro-setting constrains pathfinding/projection and charges final illuminated canvas image, mirroring internal renewal; selective sensory details (damp earth, stone warmth) filter through artist's priorities without catalog; evolves causally as it lifts post-painting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early via unused pigments, escalates accumulatively through deepening discoveries narrowing to projection/painting agency with felt emotional cost in soul-deep renewal; one tightening sufficient as film warmth forces network pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of art preserving joy emerges organically from projected memories blending with her light-painting, resonant in fog-canvas finale reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "daydream folded back into reality" inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with artist-perceptual signature in light/fog noticing; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm from wandering calm to swirling climax intensity; purposeful compression in "hours passed, or perhaps only moments" taught early as daydream fluidity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with lines multi-tasking image/action (e.g., "fog seemed to shift, revealing a faint path"); minor figurative density in projection beat ("scenes of laughter... danced across the mist") but pattern-consistent without muddle; no loops, strong propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of light-painting on fog-memories via ancient film projector transforms artist-burnout trope into fresh orchard-ruin reverie; risk in fluid daydream frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight as fresco sparks cascade to glowing creation.</comment>
