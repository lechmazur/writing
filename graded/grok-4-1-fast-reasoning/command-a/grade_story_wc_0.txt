<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear in stripping drama via experiments, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "kindled humility" and "quiet reverence" without embodied contradiction in pivotal dust observation; no deep flaws complicate choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with dust patterns building to CR closure via butterfly emergence reweighting decay-to-creation; orientation anchored early in greenhouse post-flood; summary time jumps ("days turned into weeks") fit lens without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse vividly sensory (chill, shattered glass, damp soil) mirroring internal decay, subtly guiding experiments; recurring dust/soil constrains patterns but lacks pivotal choice constraint at butterfly moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transformation via dust escalates accumulatively through purposeful pattern shifts to butterfly; one deepening (dust responding to thoughts) narrows interpretive options with emotional humility cost, but stakes feel abstractly intellectual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gradual change theme emerges from dust-to-butterfly arc, but final paragraph's direct articulation ("the dust had stripped away the needless drama") is Thematic Echo replacing resonant image with stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature blending scientific precision (dust patterns) and awe; rhythmic modulation suits reflective accumulative drive; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("dust wasn’t just... it was" twice) and repetitive "decay" phrasing dull density in pattern description; rhythm varies but synonym churn on "shimmering" drags propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star decay with butterfly dust catalyzing greenhouse rebirth transforms tropes organically; butterfly emergence as macro/micro bridge feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
