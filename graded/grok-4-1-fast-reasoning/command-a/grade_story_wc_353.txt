<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, rooted in pure ambition to voice silence, but lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating micro-choices; competent execution without genuine struggle reduces depth at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from analysis to completion; on-page RR closure in final sculpture image with trembling hands as felt cost; orientation anchored immediately in grove and Elara's role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid tactile details like bark hum and porcelain smoothness constrain her hand-attuned work; grove's canopy and hush charge the silent music final image, meeting 9-gate via recurring setting-object interplay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering sculpture's song signaled early, escalates via textural deepening as insulator amplifies and connection palpables; agency in chiseling forecloses silence with hands' tremble as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of music in stillness emerges organically from cracks-as-notes and final lingering melody; resonant non-literal closure reweights silence without moralizing, though some counter-readings limited by pure resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual bias to tactile silence and symphonic wood; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate to trembling, distinct signature in hand-focused noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrought throughout working beats ("whispered secrets," "orchestra of shadows") without crisp propulsion; repetitive silence/music phrasing creates minor synonym churn, dulling peak chiseling rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synesthetic premise of crack-reading as sculpture-song transforms nature tropes; risk in lyric accumulative design heightens quiet stakes, inevitable in hindsight via particulars like insulator conduction.</comment>
