<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to safeguard town's soul clear and intensifies via discoveries; actions like exhibit setup align with vigilant traits. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with interiority leaning generic like "heart full."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as photo density builds to bottle discovery and exhibit; closure as RR (town resurfaces emotionally) legible with cost in reclaimed memories. Orientation anchors early; one tightening via trail suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "boots sank slightly into the damp earth" and "stars pricking... pinholes" filter through warden's vigilance; recurring reservoir mirrors charge final reflection. Ridgeway constrains path to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming memory signaled early, deepened accumulatively by final photo/bottle; no on-page reversal narrows options or tests commitment visibly. Smooth success lacks agency-driven trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of resurfacing forgotten past emerges organically from photos/exhibit; final framed label and chime reweight without moralizing. Complexity in flood loss lingers; capped by Q4 escalation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in "mirrored hush" and "glassy surface"; rhythm modulates discovery to resolution. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels via image integration; "resurfacing" motif purposeful without loop excess. Minor density slip in stacked figuratives like "pinholes in a dark cloth" but coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Photo trail to liqueur as memory catalyst fresh synthesis of rediscovery trope; organic under accumulative lens. Transformation via warden's humane spin avoids template satisfaction.</comment>
