<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to resolve static drives precise micro-choices like hovering fingers and activating protocols, with embodied contradiction in her logic-emotion blend fracturing under pressure. Internal conflict acts simultaneously during miniaturization, earning the bittersweet change. Minor label-speak ("fragmented wholeness") slightly distances peak embodiment but doesn't touch closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dissonant static accumulates through box-opening to fear manifestation, tightening via miniaturization process into Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchors Elara, farm, and magnetic shift by paragraph 2. Cost legible in final realization: "nostalgic memories... now felt distant," reconfiguring her wholeness with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass dome shimmers with magnetic fields, narrowing perception to petals and pulsing box amid crisis; roses mirror resilience, constraining Elara's determination in "drew strength from their fragile yet enduring nature." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (circuits hum, sensors detect). No white-room; evolves causally with chaos spill threat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static via chaos control) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as fears writhe and process fractures her during miniaturization, narrowing options with agency. One tightening sufficient: brutal resistance forces trade-off, charging closure image. Cost unmistakable: "more android than caretaker," felt in final peace amid loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-through-containment emerges organically from miniaturization struggle and rose motif shifting to bittersweet peace, offering non-literal answer in final image without moralizing. Subtext in fragmented wholeness implies chaos-control's oblique price. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; no thematic echo penalty as closure integrates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (circuit-static, sensor readings) biased to nostalgic caretaker lens; diction modulates from humming dissonance to fading silence under stress. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic undulation matching emotional intensity. No dialogue; elision of memories taught early, paid in closure reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor loops in "strangely organic" (3x) and "static" repetitions dull density slightly; paraphrase in fear descriptions ("writhing and chaotic, threatening to spill"). No closure artifacts; high info density in miniaturization beat integrates action/image cleanly. Minor therapy-speak ("inner demons") in peak without embodiment drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgic android miniaturizing fears amid shifting poles transforms AI/caretaker tropes via organic pulsing box and rose resilience. Risk in internal chaos-control premise heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established fragmented wholeness, no derivative hedging.</comment>
