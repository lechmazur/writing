<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, rooted in family downfall; interiority concrete via sensory grip on crank but slips into stock phrasing like "heart pounded." Final change to "keeper of a hidden truth" earned by visionary process with felt pain, but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density builds from melody to standing waves vision to journal CR, reconfiguring role with painful cost legible in "truth was painful, but it was hers to bear." Orientation anchored early; visionary shard transition motivated by crank turn, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gramophone and crank handle as micro-setting constrain choice (turning activates waves) and charge final image (resting beside her). Sensory details vivid/selective (scent of aged paper, brass gleam), integrated into action; visionary bridge evolves consistently, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via music-vision-deepening to journal with agency (crank turn, journal grasp). One tightening forecloses revival option; cost felt in "mind racing" realization, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sound-truthed legacy emerges organically from waves/journal, final image resonant non-literal answer (keeper role) reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures; earned insight from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable, perceptual signature poetic/selective (noticing carvings, vibrations in soul). Voice texture distinct in syntax/rhythm ("sepia reading room bathed in golden shadows"); brief figure dialogue natural/subtextual, advances revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some overwriting in purple clusters ("golden shadows deepened as evening turned to night") dulls high-pressure vision beat; minor paraphrase loops ("eloquently silent" twice). Rhythm varies, density high, but repetitive motifs border template cadence without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gramophone/sound waves as temporal bridge transforms legacy trope; standing waves intuition feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in visionary pivot heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
