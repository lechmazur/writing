<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear in solitude vs. action conflict, embodied in hesitation before entering alley; earned resolve at tower dialogue. Internal impulses contradict (integrity demands solitude yet curiosity pulls), shown via micro-choices like timing patrols. Masked figure applies pressure effectively but briefly; traits particular via storm-pattern intuition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tube discovery therefore investigation, patrol intuition therefore entry, figure revelation therefore purpose shift. Closure as Charged Poise in final tube lightness and courtyard return, with solitude cost legible ("life would never be the same"). Orientation anchored by ~100 words; one tightening at zone entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details purposeful (damp earth, hum, floodlights), constrain choices (patrol patterns, spiral stairs). Courtyard dusk mirrors internal tranquility, recharges closure image; industrial wasteland vivid via POV bias. Spatial choreography clear from alley to tower.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel message vs. solitude) signaled early, tightens causally at zone slip-in narrowing options. Agency in lateral progress and climb; cost felt in "compromising the solitude he cherished." Figure confrontation forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of integrity evolving from solitude to action emerges via events, not statement; final image reconfigures premise non-literally. Subtext in tube's shifting weight; ambiguity in threat lingers without tidy moral. Resonance from particulars like erratic storms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern intuition); dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("someone who’ll act with integrity"). Rhythm modulates tension; minor filter verbs but voice-motivated. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density, vivid propulsion; rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in slip-in). Minor paraphrase loop in "curiosity...credible" variants dulls slightly; no closure touch, strong verbs dominate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm recorder + analog tube in digital era + engineered storms; transforms mystery tropes via lateral intuition. Risk in quarantine breach heightens stakes organically; no close echoes.</comment>
