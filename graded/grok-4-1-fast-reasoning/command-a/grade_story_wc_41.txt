<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to capture the sound is clear and rooted in traits like precognitive forgetfulness, shown when he wonders if moving backward; embodied via tactile chalk-grime contrast. Internal conflict mild—contradictory impulses (future-sight vs. present-sieve) don't act simultaneously in pivotal marking beats. Final acceptance earned but lacks deeper micro-choice hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: markers accumulate density to circle at pond, yielding CR closure as he hears the hum and chalk slips ("didn’t need it anymore"), with felt cost of time's weight legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (garden, Elias); no shards, single scene coherent. One tightening via driftwood find suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sculptures (loops, spiral, stone figures) constrain path and charge choices, fog hides/reveals mirroring doubt, pond enables final damp line—recurring micro-setting (ground-marking) shapes tactics and final image. Sensory hierarchy vivid/tactile under POV urgency; fog evolution causal with movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate sound) signaled early, accumulates via markers to cadence shift at hum; one deepening (fog-thick → lift → circle) narrows perceptual options under Textural lens. Agency in endurance (marking despite forgetfulness) forecloses doubt path with chalk-drop cost. Mild pressure, no reversal beyond density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of echoes vs. new moments emerges organically from markers/sculptures shifting to acceptance; final hum/image reweights clinging without moralizing. Subtext in sculpture readings (archway as childhood) layers ambiguity. Resonant non-literal answer: sound anchors present amid future-pull.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sculptures as regrets/memories); lyrical voice modulates rhythm to pressure (short sentences at hum). Compression purposeful/legible; diction biased to Elias's prophetic sieve-prism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm/read-aloud flow; minor paraphrase loops ("closed his eyes" x2, kneel/mark repeats) but pattern-taught as method, not obscuring closure. No heavy artifacts; propulsion weaves image/action seamlessly to chalk-slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophetic forgetfulness + sound-hunt in fog-garden transforms aging trope via markers' circle; risk in lyric wandering pays off at hum-realization, inevitable in hindsight without gimmick.</comment>
