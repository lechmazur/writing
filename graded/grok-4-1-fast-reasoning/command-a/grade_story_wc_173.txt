<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via felt weight of threads' stories during untangling, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; smooth intuition over genuine struggle flattens interior conflict at pivotal door-opening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from thread vibrations to harmonizing note and echo release; Charged Poise closure in snow carrying fragments reconfigures complacency with conceptual cost to city's awakening and her role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of snow, crystalline refractions, and humming threads constrains delicate untangling choice; recurring snow charges final image, mirroring internal defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to awaken city tightens accumulatively via loosening threads to resonant door glow; agency in tracing/dancing forecloses conformity path with legible role-change cost at ending smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of individuality vs. conformity emerges organically from echo harvest and thread stories; final snowflake fragments offer resonant non-literal answer, reweighting defiance as creation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature in embodied grace and thread perceptions; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel most beats, but figurative overwriting in opening ("each flake seemed to whisper") risks minor muddle before tightening; no loops touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh chaste-courtesan rebel unlocking memory-threads in poetic fantasy transforms tropes; echo-snow synthesis feels inevitable and risks bold lyricism heightening stakes.</comment>
