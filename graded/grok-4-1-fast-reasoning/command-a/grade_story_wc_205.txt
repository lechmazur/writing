<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in redemption via temporal plasticity, shown through her unorthodox ritual and bittersweet tears during visions; interiority concrete via shard's rainbows and "burnished sorrow." Internal conflict subtle in obsession vs. ridicule, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in the climactic Hall scene. Earned endurance of unhealed wounds forecloses vengeful triumph with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from backstory shards to storm visions, culminating in CR via holographic evidence on shard with bittersweet cost legible in "wounds remained unhealed." Orientation anchored early (Zahir-7, Elara by para 1). One tightening in Hall entry and visions suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's spires, canals, light-storms vividly constrain choices—sealed Hall forces sneaking, mirrors/shard align with luminescence to enable visions. Shard as micro-setting charges final pocket image, reweighting broken beauty. Sensory hierarchy (light-dominant) fits crisis; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove theory for redemption) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dispute backdrop to Hall visions confirming plasticity. Agency in slipping in and arranging shard forecloses failure path; cost felt in "burnished sorrow" tears and unhealed wounds on page. Coherent pressure without reversals fits lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining emerges organically from visions of flux-civilization and Elara's arc, resonant in final shard-as-reminder image reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in shard's evolving symbolism (talisman to evidence) avoids platitudes; complexity in bittersweet triumph lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic perceptual signature ("shimmering ribbons," "torrents of luminescence") biases toward visionary details. Voice modulates rhythmically, diction controlled and character-specific (poetic under passion). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., shard facets advance character/atmosphere), varied rhythm supports propulsion. Minor overwriting in figurative stacks ("gilded spires and obsidian canals," "ethereal radiance") during buildup slightly dulls peak visions; no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, temporal plasticity, and baroque sci-fi archaeology transforms tropes via shard ritual; risk in poetic voice/lyric closure heightens stakes. Final poem whisper feels inevitable from "poetically inclined" setup, no derivatives.</comment>
