<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in trembling hands and instinctive sorting, with contradictory control/chaos impulses acting in the card-gathering beat; change earned via prior despair causality. Minor slips in diagnostic phrasing like "luminescent pulse" verge on therapy-speak but don't flatten pressure. Final ascent choice reveals values hierarchy with visible cost of accepting imperfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: card-sorting density increases to pattern break at new tapestry emergence, yielding Charged Poise RR/CR closure in ascent with felt cost of foreclosed control. Orientation anchored by para 1 (Elara, library/lighthouse, broken box). One tightening via rearranged cards narrows options without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (aged paper/salt, groaning walls, roaring sea) mirrors internal fragmentation and constrains choices via dust/decay isolation. Lighthouse lantern faint glow charges final image, receding walls evolve causally. POV bias filters professionally (artist tracing card edges).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative despair) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as card rearrangement deepens knowledge of chaos/beauty, forcing renunciation of control with on-page cost in steady hands/lingering ache. Protagonist agency in redesign forecloses prior path; cost legible in "ache...no longer a burden."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness-to-renewal emerges organically from card shards/tapestry shift, final image ("ache...her muse") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting light/dark premise. Minor overtness in grandma quote and "Art is not about perfection" borders moralizing but ties to prior cue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (artistic noticing of symbols/colors/edges); voice texture modulates rhythmically from echo-whispers to purposeful ascent. No dialogue; purposeful metaphorical compression taught early (threads/shards) legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., Tower card traces destruction-to-renewal); rhythm varies for propulsion. −0.8 for "luminescent" loops (pulse/ache/glow/question) and paraphrase redundancy in fragmentation shards/mirror/tapestry without pattern payoff, dulling peak sorting beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh lighthouse-library/tarot-artist synthesis transforms epiphany trope via grounded card mechanics and texture-build to CR closure. Risky metaphorical extension (walls/threads/light) heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
