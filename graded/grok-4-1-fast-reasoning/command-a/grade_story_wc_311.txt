<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to name fears roots clearly in her heartbreak, driving micro-choices like placing the page and naming monsters. Embodied grief (tremor in heart, dulled scythe) shows contradiction without labels. Final transformation feels earned via ritual causality, foreclosing aimless wandering with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from page hum to voices weaving and names etching air. Orientation anchors immediately in observatory with Elara's state. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in realization ("heartbreak had not been in vain"), reweighting loss with undeniable conceptual cost in final scythe image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's platform and runes constrain ritual choice, flaring light to enable crystallization. Sensory details (creaking dome, thickening air, glinting fins) mirror internal sorrow purposefully. Final fading light charges closure image, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears for purpose) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via voices settling weight on shoulders. Agency in placing page and naming narrows to reconfiguration, with felt emotional cost legible in kneeling realization. One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo of sacrifice emerges organically from voices' stories and Elara's loss, reweighting grief as enduring light. Final image offers non-literal answer: scattered light persists post-dissolution. No moralizing; ambiguity in transformation lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward sorrowful echoes and light. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, incantatory phrasing (e.g., "Through scattered light"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally with ritual intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, interiority without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in crystallization beat. Minor overwriting in metaphors (tapestry/ripples) stays purposeful without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper myth, atlas lore, and light-ritual transforms grief into creation. Naming nameless fears via observatory mechanics feels inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
