<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in diary-clutching and parley declaration, compelling higher-stakes ritual; interiority concrete in breath-catching at code but leans tell-y with "searing reverie" phrasing. Internal conflict mild—grief/determination blend lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on page. Final hope earned via prior persistence without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from diary traces to debris ritual to lagoon stir, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("glimmer of hope—a promise...set free") with felt cost of ongoing journey. Orientation anchored immediately in zeppelin/dunes. One tightening via figure's emergence reconfigures options legibly; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (boots sinking, sun's golden glow, water's ripple) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal tension; obsidian lagoon constrains ritual choice and charges final image. Atmosphere purposeful, evolving with descent; spatial choreography coherent in dunes approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth via diary/lagoon) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through doubt-creep to figure's nod, forcing stance crystallization with agency in parley; cost legible in "journey far from over." Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution; one decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silenced voices/truth emerges organically from diary echoes and debris pleas, resonating in final "truth...set free" without moralizing; subtext in figure's ancient eyes reweights erasure motif. Complexity lingers in painful promise; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in history-attuned noticing (journal spine, crumbling letters); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating to terse at parley. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing closure; no head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, propulsion strong in ritual build; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("shadow stretching like a dark whisper," "symbols...danced") dulls one high-pressure beat without closure touch. No loops/scaffold; density high, info multi-jobbed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of zeppelin archive, debris signals, lagoon guardian transforms civil-rights trope into ritual parley; risk in smoky figure payoff feels inevitable from debris setup. No derivative echoes; bold world-logic commits fully.</comment>
