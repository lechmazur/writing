<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in past failure drives choices like following markers and playing flute despite hesitation; interior conflict embodied in trembling hands and flashing memories. Final purpose feels earned via hesitation resolved with cost awareness. Minor stock phrasing in reflections slightly undercuts particularity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: failure backstory motivates quest, markers lead to flute, playing triggers DC into new world with felt risk from past. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Charged Poise reconfigures options with undeniable stakes in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hush and thunder constrain path via markers and deepen alcove tension; canyon walls closing mirrors internal pressure. "Avalanchingly quiet" and evolving silence charge hesitation beat. POV-filtered details purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (master flute without repeating failure) signaled early, tightens via hesitation at pedestal into agency-driven play. Past rift cost legible, new world crystallizes trade-off. Escalation coherent under causal lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of harvesting failure emerges via orb memory shifting to flute purpose; final image resonant without moralizing. Subtext in silence vs hum reweights power's peril. No tidy epiphany, ambiguity lingers in "true challenge."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual hush signature; voice modulates from heavy silence to shimmering release. Rhythmic diction fits relic-keeper's driven texture. No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "canyon hush" and "trembling hands" create minor paraphrase loops (−0.4); some overwriting in "avalanchingly quiet" jars rhythm. Density strong overall, propulsion via image integration. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh hush motif transforms relic quest via silence-weaving tension; driftwood markers add specific ingenuity. Trope of magical artifact subverted by failure lessons. Risks bold atmospheric build without gimmick.</comment>
