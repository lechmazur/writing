<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to rescue arts rooted in traits and intensifies via lens strangeness; embodied "rosewater dread" concrete. Internal hope/fear conflict acts in baking choice. Final realization slightly told, lacking micro-choice contradiction at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motifs (lens, bread, honey) builds to square RR closure with communal thaw as reconfiguration. Cost legible in "weight of her mission" final image. Orientation anchored early; no penalty. Minor summary in "days that followed" softens on-page decisiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto setting (damp air, mist "clinging like dread," bioluminescent fungi) selectively sensory, POV-filtered by historical eye. Waterfall charges final image, mirroring internal thaw. Micro-setting (workshop oven, stone altar) constrains baking/square choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive tradition) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lens "chime" and square gathering that reweights communal options. Agency in baking/sharing forecloses loss path with felt dread cost. No major reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving displaced heritage emerges from bread initials/lens motifs shifting to revival. Final image (lens reflecting waterfall) offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars avoid platitudes; irony in "forgotten" thawed by artifact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with historical perceptual signature (artifacts "tell a story"). Rhythm modulates from dread-tinged reflection to communal lift. No dialogue; diction controlled, biased to relics/traditions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; sensory propulsion in "fragrant...crisp and golden." Minor paraphrase loops ("emerald tint" thrice, repetitive lens handling); synonym churn in dread motifs dulls slightly but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (honey/lens catalyzing tradition) transforms refugee tropes via grotto specificity. Risk in subtle supernatural without explanation heightens stakes. No derivative templates; bread initials ingenious pivot.</comment>
