<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to prove "scars can sing" roots deeply in father's legacy and firefighter role, driving the grafting act with embodied contradiction (calloused hands, hardened heart). Internal conflict shows via refusal to seek atonement, instead embracing transformation, earning final peace. Minor reflection on villagers feels diagnostic but anchors present choice without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from arrival to grafting to standing back, with tightening in the act itself creating Charged Poise closure: "scars...sang" reconfigures her burden with felt cost (possible failure, throbbed scars). Orientation anchors Elara, lagoon, dunes by para 2. Single scene holds without shards or transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon, black sand, migrating clouds constrain choices (kneeling edge, digging sterile soil) and charge final image (kelp-drift peace mirroring heart). Sensory hierarchy (cool water touch, wind scent, rippling surface) filters through Elara's priorities, evolving with clouds' peak. Micro-setting via sand/coin enables graft payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform sterile life) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via wind/roaring clouds deepening hope vs rejection risk, narrowing to graft decision with agency. Felt cost legible in "might fail" and throbbed scars foreclosing easy atonement. Climax act forces stance crystallization without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of damaged beauty emerges organically from coin/seeds in sand, culminating in resonant final image: scars "sang...echoed the resilience," reweighting premise without moral. Particulars (father's legacy, wildflower seeds) avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in fragile hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature fluid/graceful (e.g., "movements as fluid as the kelp"). Voice modulates rhythm with intensity, diction biased to resilience motifs. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short prayer para breathes, longer grafting builds density); info-dense lines integrate setting/action (e.g., "fingers brushing the cool, smooth surface"). Minor paraphrase loops ("resilience" x3, black sand motifs) in mid but purposeful, not obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arsonist-daughter firefighter grafting coin/seeds in volcanic sand transforms redemption trope via "scars can sing" synthesis, organic to setting/motifs. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early legacy burden. Risks lyric quietude heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
