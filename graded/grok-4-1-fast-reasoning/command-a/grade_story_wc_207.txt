<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandfather's note and psychometry visions compels descent effectively; micro-choices like dipping fingers reveal curiosity under mystery's pressure. Internal conflict emerges mildly in compass loss acceptance versus prior seeking. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to CR closure: compass sinking ("some things were meant to be lost") reconfigures seeking into embrace of unknown with conceptual cost of forfeited answers. Orientation anchored early at factory edge; single-shard causality tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Limestone cliffs and glowing lagoon constrain climax dip and charge final image, with petrichor recurring tactilely through action. Sensory hierarchy (scents prioritized) reflects petrichor collector's bias; vivid integration avoids white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find explanations' failure) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via psychometry flashes and compass stilling, narrowing to lagoon realization. Visible cost in compass forfeiture alters ascent; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of infinite mystery over answers emerges organically from descent particulars, resonant in rain's final petrichor image repricing prior seeking without moralizing. Lagoon as "hinge" subtly reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with scent-biased perceptual signature ("air smelled of rust and rain"); rhythmic modulation builds mystery without leakage. Prose texture distinct, lyric without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels descent; minor tell in epiphany ("understood now") slightly dulls peak image. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Petrichor collector premise fresh-synthesizes sensory occupation with psychometry for non-obvious mystery arc; transforms abandoned-factory trope via compass constraint without gimmickry.</comment>
