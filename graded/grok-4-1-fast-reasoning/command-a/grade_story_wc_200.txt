<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to heal through laughter is consistent and drives harp-playing choices, but interior conflict feels summarized rather than embodied until late "ache in her own chest." Figure's confession reveals traits under pressure effectively. Minor slip in archetypal "modestly fearless" label without strong contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of whispers, notes, and grief building to RR closure in "figure dissolved into light, tooth falling" with felt emotional cost. Single scene anchors orientation early in gorge descent. No causality breaks; micro-turn at confession tightens stakes legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge's "jagged rock and echoing whispers" integrates tactilely via steps and sounds, constraining pursuit and amplifying confession. Harp as micro-setting charges final alignment image. Sensory selection reflects Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gathering confession escalates accumulatively through note intensity and unfolding memory, narrowing to release with visible cost in figure's weeping and dissolution. Elara's agency in listening/playing drives deepening. One tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-release via laughter emerges organically from memory image and faint echoes, reweighting "sorrow and hope" without statement. Final "laughter, faint but undeniable" offers non-literal resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity in Elara's lingering ache adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature in "distorted notes humming faintly." Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in "I'm here to listen," advancing confession. Rhythm modulates with intensity; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering like "tapestry of sorrow and hope," but minor paraphrase loops in "echoed softly/echoing whispers/echoes carrying" dull propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies for ear; closure image clear. No heavy artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fantasy premise transforms soul-collection via harp frequencies and tooth relic organically. Fresh synthesis of grief/healing in gorge setting avoids tropes. Risk in luminous tone heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
