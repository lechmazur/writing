<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's warmly observant eyes and pocketed sea glass habit ground motivation early, with micro-choices like rearranging stones earning his resolve; internal conflict between fascination and unnamed ache layers credibly. Minor slip: final epiphany on safety feels slightly told via letter rather than fully embodied in pivotal dark-room actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as mysteries (flicker, glass, stones, letters) densify to on-page Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias lights the lamp at dawn, reweighting his ache with resolve and felt emotional cost in the warming sea glass. Orientation anchored immediately in lighthouse/criffs; one tightening via stone rearrangement suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea glass and lantern room details constrain choices (e.g., finding etched glass in dark, stones in corner) and charge final image of warmer pocketed glass mirroring resolve. Sensory hierarchy via Elias's priorities (waves/gulls/glow) integrates purposefully without catalog; spatial choreography coherent in single room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decipher/protect light escalates accumulatively via each message beat, narrowing to stance crystallization in dawn lighting with legible emotional cost (ache replaced by resolve). Protagonist agency in rearranging stones drives key tightening; no coincidences resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of bottling safety via understanding threats emerges organically from message chain, culminating in resonant final image without moralizing; subtext in luminescent ache's shift carries emotional honesty. Minor overtness in letter's "To bottle the feeling of safety..." borders thematic echo, softening peak resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in observant noticing (e.g., "waves crashed below, the gulls crying overhead") modulates rhythm under darkening stress; diction fits reticent skipper without register drift. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene acceleration (short sentences in dark discovery beats); high density integrates action/atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Minor paraphrase in repeated "message" motifs (glass/stones/letters) slightly dulls one mid-beat, but purposeful under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes lighthouse tropes via precise message chain (3-1-2 stones to letters) into fresh accumulative mystery; risk in cryptic puzzles pays off in charged poise closure. Transformation of sea glass from ache-symbol to resolve-anchor feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
