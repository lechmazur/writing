<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, intensifying through revelations, with embodied emotions like heart quickening and chest tremor. Interiority concrete and particular to her ghost-whisperer role. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or flaws driving on-page mistakes, yielding smooth competence over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream visions build density to pattern break and Conceptual Repricing closure as globe clears ("its murky liquid clearing just enough to reveal the village"). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. Cost legible in whispered names and silent promise foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (humming ice walls, flickering flames) filtered through Elara's priorities, with shrine enabling ritual and globe as recurring object charging final image. Atmosphere tensions cold isolation against connection. Spatial choreography clean in altar-focused actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover globe's story) signaled early; accumulation of dream shards deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, narrowing to family revelation. Agency in focusing and assembling tests commitment. Stakes viscerally mild—no live opposition or foreclosed option beyond felt emotional tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging voices from loss emerges organically from visions and final glow, offering resonant non-literal answer in dawn-painted sky contrasting cold. Subtext in warped beauty enduring. Avoids moralizing; particulars like child's laughter reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (shadows dancing, ancient energy humming). Poetic diction and rhythm modulate effectively with intensity, apt for mystical tone. No head-hopping or elision; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, with high density integrating action, image, and interiority. Figurative language consistent and voice-motivated (e.g., "weave truth"), no muddle or loops. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors slightly dulls propulsion but spares peak visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diver and dream-analysis transforms ghost story tropes into textured ritual. Dream cameos as method offers non-obvious angle. Risky poetic compression heightens mystical stakes organically.</comment>
