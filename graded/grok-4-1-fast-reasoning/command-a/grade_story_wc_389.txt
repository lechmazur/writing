<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in prophetic drive, embodied in trembling hands on radio/portico; internal conflict mild but contradictory impulses surface in hesitation before activation. Stock phrasing like "weary, gleamed with determination" borders cliché without deeper contradiction under peak stress. Final change as prophet earned via prior sacrifices but lacks raw embodied cost in bittersweet smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: radio frequency builds density to portico activation (DC via fracturing light), yielding RR (Elias reconfigured as prophet) with felt cost in sacrifices/journey. One tightening via weeks of deciphering narrows to "night of the prophet’s rise." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and cobalt portico vividly constrain choices (hand on humming surface guides activation) and charge final image (etched symbols, parted clouds). Sensory hierarchy fits visionary POV: lightning/radio whispers prioritize prophetic urgency over mundane. Portico evolves causally from pulsing to fracturing/whole, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape new dawn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intensifying visions/voice to portico command; activation agency forecloses old order with storm-pull cost. One deepening (voice from faint melody to insistent "Unfold it") reweights knowledge/options. Moral calculus in "old order or new one" sharpens peak without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of bridging past/future emerges organically from portico visions/choice, resonant in final dawn image reweighting sacrifices without moralizing. Subtext in "variant allegiance" implies ambiguity lingering post-reconfiguration. No tidy binary; bittersweet hope embraces complexity from particulars like ancient shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with visionary perceptual signature (radio whispers as "melody," portico "rippling like water"); rhythmic modulation heightens storm climax. Lyrical diction purposeful and consistent, no head-hopping or withholding. Voice texture distinct in prophetic phrasing like "weave the past and future."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "portico seemed to pulse in rhythm" advances setting/pressure); varied rhythm suits accumulative build. Minor artifacts: paraphrase loops in vision summaries ("more vivid, more urgent"), but not in closure; no filter stacks or template cadence in peak. Closure image propels cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Transforms prophet trope via radio/portico synthesis, fresh in "variant allegiance" choice amid gritty storm mysticism. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established visionary pattern. Risks lyrical grandeur without gimmick, committing to premise implications in etched symbols/dawn.</comment>
