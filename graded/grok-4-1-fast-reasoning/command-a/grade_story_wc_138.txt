<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in driving experimentation to closure change, but interiority relies on abstract tells like "endless, aching void" without embodied contradictory impulses acting in pivotal storm-channeling beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore from fragment pickup to shatter-induced RR (Charged Poise) at "power now a part of him"; cost legible in wreckage and unleashed mutiny; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains via dimensional ripples and storm energy channeling in climax; selective sensory details like "colors twisted into chaotic patterns" mirror internal shift and charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of breaking monotony escalates causally through magnetic manipulation to shatter, narrowing options with uncontrolled mutiny cost; agency in pressing on despite resistance tightens effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of purpose from chaos emerges via particulars like fragment integration; final "spark of purpose" reconfigures immortality premise non-literally with resonant wreckage image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with dimensionally aware perceptual signature; voice texture modulates rhythmically from calm to "blinding flash" peak without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density overloads high-pressure climax ("kaleidoscope of dimensions," "hushed thunder") with mixed vehicles dulling propulsion; minor synonym loops in void/emptiness phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny infuses fresh angle on immortality boredom trope via magnetic/dimensional synthesis; lacks bold risks as arc follows familiar artifact-transformation without hindsight inevitability.</comment>
