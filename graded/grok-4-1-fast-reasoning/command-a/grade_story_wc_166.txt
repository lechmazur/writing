<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to pen verse intensifies via embodied risk in trembling hands and defiant stance; contradictory urge vs. erasure fear acts in scene, earning final hold-out. Minor abstraction in "singular motivation" slightly dilutes particularity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to charged poise closure—sentinel's pause and retreat reconfigures defiance with erasure cost legible in "discovery meant erasure." One tightening via footsteps suffices; orientation anchored early in garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's dewy petals, obsidian flowers, and earth rooting constrain dance/writing choices and charge final exhale image; sensory hierarchy (cool air, wind's pauses) reflects tide dancer's bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden verse vs. erasure) signaled early, textural escalation via dust activation to footsteps narrows flight option; agency in showing arm forecloses path with on-page risk felt in hovering weapon.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory in gaps emerges via verse line and sentinel reconfiguration, reweighting ban without statement; final flowers' whisper offers non-literal resonance on exile's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in cosmic voids/gaps; rhythmic prose modulates from stillness to spin, texture distinct and pressure-heightened without slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via image integration, rhythm varies with dance; minor metaphor stack ("shadows stretched like whispers across dewy petals") in opening slightly risks overwrite but stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nostalgia ban, tide-to-starlight dance, skin-verse synthesis transforms tropes organically; gaps method and fledge arc feel inevitable, bold lyric premise risks pay off in charged poise.</comment>
