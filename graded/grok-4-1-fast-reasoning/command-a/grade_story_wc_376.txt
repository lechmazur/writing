<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's gift creates embodied contradiction—gilded leaves wilt in chamber despite glowing brighter elsewhere—compelling her to inscribe despite bitterness, earning final hope. Interiority concrete via trembling hands and racing mind under pressure. Minor summary of backstory flattens one micro-choice but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: map fragments accumulate to chamber revelation (DC tightening), culminating in CR via new plate and water trickle with conceptual cost of sacrificed oasis. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Verdania greenhouse). Closure cost legible in "chamber trembled, and a faint trickle of water echoed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zinc plate and gilded leaves constrain choices (alignment, wilting reaction) and charge final image (new plate beside fragment). Sensory details purposeful: undercity's "scent of decaying plants and rusting metal" mirrors decay theme. Greenhouse domes and toxic sky pressure artificial reliance without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore oasis via truths) signaled early, tightens via chamber betrayal revelation forcing trade-off (accept dishonesty's cost). Agency in inscribing despite wilting forecloses easy renewal path. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens; cost felt in wilting leaves and "bitter" truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of candor renewing despite cost emerges via wilting/glowing leaves and final "hope...built on truth." Resonant non-literal answer in water trickle reweights lost conversations as "seeds." No moralizing; ambiguity in betrayal lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with calligrapher's perceptual bias (etchings "hum," scripts "pulsate"). Rhythmic modulation under stress: short sentences in chamber ("She stepped back, her mind racing."). No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate action, sense, interiority (e.g., "traced the lines...feeling a faint hum"). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in opening ("towering glass domes pierced") doesn't dull closure. Clean propulsion to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: candor-sensitive calligraphy revives world via postal "lost conversations"—non-obvious premise transformed through wilting constraint and chamber payoff. Risk in quiet CR heightens stakes without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
