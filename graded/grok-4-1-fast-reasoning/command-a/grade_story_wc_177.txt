<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract with unembodied epiphanies like "heart raced as they realized"; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in ritual beats to earn the final insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from ritual setup to symbols dancing and seal pulsating; CR closure lands on-page via resonance realization with conceptual cost in seal's dissolution and endless wonder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (storm's howl as heartbeat, shifting wall patterns) mirrors internal expansion; bunker/wafer seal as micro-setting charges final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher directive for path-walker mystery) signaled early; accumulative deepening via intensifying focus and pulsating symbols narrows to resonance insight with felt transcendence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonant paths emerges organically from symbols weaving connections; final CR image non-literally answers central question, reweighting prior ritual without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in interpretive mysticism; rhythmic texture modulates from preparation to peak insight, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in bunker/mind reflections and stacked figurines (labyrinthine, precisely playful) dull density in mid-beats; rhythm propels but overwriting fringes closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of directive code as reality-map transforms mysticism tropes; name/concept inflections like "Foresight Hindsight Only" feel inevitable to resonance payoff.</comment>
