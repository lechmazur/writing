<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's weariness and stubbornness motivate searches effectively, embodied in "weight of years... like a second skin," but traits like "inadvertently stubborn" lean tell over contradictory impulses acting in scene; final purpose feels earned yet lacks micro-choice hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: package → library → book discovery → piece hunts → assembly → signal (DC/RR at "lens... glowed... city sent out its signal"); orientation anchored early ("underwater city library"); closure cost legible in "weariness lifting like a tide receding."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration ("breath fogging... lantern," "pages... pulsing faintly") mirrors internal states and guides choices (aisles, algae waterfall); recurring lens charges final image, constraining assembly amid "seaweed-choked" decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete lens for city's soul/signal) signaled early, tightens via causal piece discoveries narrowing options; agency in "dove into the depths"; cost felt in effort and "final... even if too late," charging climax without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice/rest to restless emerges organically from particulars (unburyable dead → lens signal); final image ("water... part, revealing the stars") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (undertaker's burial lens on "restless," "permanent address"); rhythmic prose modulates tension ("flickering shadows... danced"); no dialogue, no issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but "chased stillness" loops twice without payoff and minor paraphrase ("give rest... permanent address") dull minor beats; no closure harm, strong propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker in drowned library transforming lens trope into soul-conduit; "impossible spaces" like "coral-encrusted statue" feel organic, risking surreal payoff without gimmick.</comment>
