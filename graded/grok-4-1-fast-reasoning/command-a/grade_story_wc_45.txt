<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism and yearning create contradictory impulses shown in maze navigation and fountain hesitation; dropping the stone earns change with felt cost. Forgiving nature toward changeling revealed in satchel thoughts. Minor label-speak ("forgiving skeptic," "shrewdly innocent") slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from maze to fountain revelation; CR closure via stone sacrifice reconfigures certainty with warmth cost on-page. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Elara, tooth, maze). One tightening at woman's demand narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fountain and maze constrain choices (guides tooth placement, tests resolve); gravel crunch and jasmine scent integrate purposefully. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities under yearning pressure. Final garden shift mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend mistakes via garden) signaled early, tightens at "piece of your certainty" demand forcing trade-off; agency in stone drop forecloses control with embodied warmth cost. Escalation via accumulative revelation coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of reshaping mistakes emerges organically from tooth-to-star and stone sacrifice; final image resonates without moralizing, reweighting certainty via "cleft." Subtext in woman's echo of Elara's guilt adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (skeptic noting maze illogic); voice texture poetic yet grounded, modulating at "heart pounding." Dialogue subtextual, advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in fountain cascade; minor overwriting in garden glows ("flowers glowed softly") risks muddle but doesn't touch closure. No loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore and internal healing via tooth-star; transforms tropes through certainty cost. Maze-to-constellations arc feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
