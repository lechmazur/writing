<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via cloth-handling but lapses into diagnostic labels like "confidently uncertain" as curse without embodied contradiction acting in scene; epiphany feels unearned as impulses summarize rather than clash simultaneously. Final folding lacks prior micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("the scrap wasn’t just a relic... a bridge"); cost legible in "echo valley longing... always be there" as felt endurance. One tightening via window moment suffices; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quarry trailer and dust/diesel evoke isolation mirroring void, with cloth as recurring object constraining reflection and charging final fold/pocket. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (appraiser on relics); no white-room, integrates via action like pressing cloth to glass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose post-loss) signaled early; accumulative deepening narrows via cloth from "mock" to bridge, forcing renunciation of fact-insulation with felt cost in acceptance of longing. Pressure coheres internally without agency-driven turn touching external test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-created purpose emerges organically from cloth evolution and quarry echo, culminating in resonant non-literal CR without moralizing; subtext in silence/applause contrast invites ambiguity on loss. Minor directness in "wrest meaning from the chaos" slightly abstracts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (relic facts vs. emotional rawness); voice texture modulates rhythmically in reflection, diction POV-plausible without filter excess. Perceptual bias sharpens on speaker details over generic grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "void/hollow/emptiness/echo" across reflection dull density (-0.5); figurative density ("thundered like a storm," "scar on the earth") overwrites without pattern payoff in peak realization. Rhythm varies but template stems ("He... felt") recur mildly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie/appraiser relics in quarry void transforms loss trope via cloth bridge; internal arc risks quiet CR over confrontation. Specifics like "frayed edges of a speaker grille cloth scrap" anchor originality without gimmick.</comment>
