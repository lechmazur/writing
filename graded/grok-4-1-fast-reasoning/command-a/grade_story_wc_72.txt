<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's telepathic intervention reveals incisive kindness through gentle warning, earning its purpose with felt cost in shifted resolve. Elara's fragile certainty shows contradictory impulses in hesitation after "hand tightening around the vessel." Minor abstraction in "tapestry of whispers" limits embodied depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations density-build to CR closure: empty ampoule buried reconfigures purpose with conceptual cost in "embracing complexity." Orientation anchored early in garden and diver arrival. Single tightening at telepathic warning fractures certainty without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Underwater garden's "tangled seaweed and crumbling stone fountains" mirrors internal fracture, constraining Liora's immovability and charging final image of buried ampoule. Sensory details selective via telepathic bias, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of infallible serum vs fragility tightens via revelation, narrowing Elara's options with on-page cost in "hesitation, her mission now complicated." Agency in Liora's warning and Elara's testing decision coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of nuance shaping certainty emerges organically from telepathic thread into "fracturing like the garden’s ancient stones," resonant non-literal answer in statue's guardianship without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited via Liora's perceptual signature in telepathic "senses threading"; poetic rhythm modulates with intensity, dialogue sparse but subtextual in murmured desperation and firm warning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with purposeful compression, high density in revelation beats; minor paraphrase loop in repeated "testament" dulls final lines slightly (−0.4). No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue animating diver's certainty via fragile ampoule transforms isolation trope; risk in stillness-as-agency heightens stakes organically.</comment>
