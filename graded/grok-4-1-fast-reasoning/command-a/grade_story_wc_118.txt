<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; smooth competence without blind spots or micro-choices under pressure leaves change unearned, as in ritual performance without prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with discovery density tightening to ritual DC/RR closure; cost legible in "weight of centuries pressing upon her," but minor summary of diaries softens one linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" motif anchors atmosphere and evolves to charge final image, constraining ritual via altar and hidden panel; sensory integration vivid and purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore dreams via displaced axis) signaled early with accumulative deepening through discoveries; one tightening (scrolls to ritual) narrows options, but lacks visible trade-off beyond felt weight at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of imagination's fracture/repair emerges organically from particulars like tapestry and ritual; final golden light offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature ("probing" past) and rhythmic modulation; poetic diction controlled, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with motif-driven rhythm ("bronze quiet"), but minor loops ("sensitively perceptive," "probe/probing") and occasional overwriting in descriptive beats dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh post-dream world with tapestry ritual synthesizing myth and history organically; risk-taking in accumulative discoveries heightens stakes toward charged reconfiguration.</comment>
