<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's featherly determination and micro-choice to leave the logbook earn a credible renunciation with embodied cost ("heart heavy yet strangely at peace"); interiority concrete via tracing codes and memory pull. Minor archetypal simplicity in lost-child quest prevents 9+ as impulses feel harmonious rather than sharply contradictory in pivotal intuition beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from codes to intuition/memory to CR closure; cost legible in logbook left as "final offering" reconfiguring distances. Orientation anchored early ("drifting prism terrace"); one tightening via terrace shift suffices, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism terrace constrains intuition ("glass groaning," "prisms rearranging") and charges final fade; sensory hierarchy POV-biased (colors wash during eyes-closed intuiting). Micro-setting (logbook pages fluttering) mirrors internal fracture purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshold secrets) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via code intuition and memory deepening that narrows to renunciation; agency in feeling code forecloses search path with peace/loss cost. Pivotal terrace shift forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds emerges organically from maze memory callback and logbook as distances, reweighted non-literally in closure realization without moralizing. Final image of leaving logbook offers resonant answer to initial question, charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (codes "whisper secrets," prisms "dance"); rhythmic modulation builds to hushed clarity. Neologism "featherly" voice-motivated and consistent; no elision issues, diction biased to quest.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful repetition ("fractured hush" deepens tone); no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("sky fractured by light") coherent but dense without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal prism-maze-pilot elements transforms lost-child trope via textural distances; risk in poetic compression pays off in inevitable CR hindsight. Bold neologism "featherly" heightens specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
