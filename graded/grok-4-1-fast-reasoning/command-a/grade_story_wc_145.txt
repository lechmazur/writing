<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to find river sources intensifies through embodied pursuit (heart quickens at vibration), earning peace at climax; subtly confident trait shown in purposeful walk, but dry-witted aspect label-only without witty micro-choices or contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from falcon/pattern to fissure discovery as CR, with legible cost in tears/understanding at "This was the singular convergence"; orientation anchored early, single scene holds to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake constrains choices (thinner ice, mist path) and charges final image (stream emerge); sensory details (crunching boots, biting cold) selective via map-POV bias, mirroring internal quest without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens accumulatively to discovery reversal narrowing options (outpost left behind); agency in following mist/kneeling dips hand forecloses prior life with emotional cost legible at tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of origins emerges organically via phrasebook/river, resonant CR in adding language "of the river itself" reweighting quest without moralizing; ambiguity in "tears...of understanding" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (map-veins in condensation) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from heavy tranquility to peace, diction purposeful without withholding or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (mist "in the real world"), varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops/artifacts, though minor overwriting in "singular convergence" repetition contained pre-climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographer's quest with hidden river source via falcon/phrasebook transforms trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at irreplaceable stream moment without gimmickry.</comment>
