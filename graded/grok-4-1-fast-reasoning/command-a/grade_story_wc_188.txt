<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through actions like spinning fire and building mosaic, earning communal cheer; interiority concrete ("heart ached, but her resolve deepened"). No deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it resolute rather than conflicted; minor archetypal sheen in hope-bringer role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: approach to courtyard builds density from personal chants/fire to communal mosaic/chorus/cheer. Closure as Charged Poise in "fortress felt alive... battle far from over," with cost legible in ongoing fight and smoldering rag. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dry fountain and wilting gardens constrain mosaic placement and mirror despair, evolving to glow via firelight; rag knot as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory details purposeful (flickering shadows, smudged hands), filtered through Lira's hopeful bias. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via chants to fire-spin gathering people to mosaic/cheer tightening communal buy-in. Agency in Lira's precise actions forecloses isolation path; cost felt in "first time in months" breakthrough charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of igniting hope emerges organically from fire/mosaic/rising sun images shifting despair to beacon without statement. Final "blooming fortress at dawn" reweights premise non-literally; subtext in playfulness amid seriousness avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: sees "canvas" potential via ambient awareness. Voice textured, rhythmic ("chants... cadence syncing"); no dialogue to judge, but whispers/cheers natural. Minor elevated diction ("weave through the stillness like a thread") fits poetic aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short cheers vs. flowing descriptions); density high, sentences multi-job. Minor figurative density ("gravity of hopelessness," "floodgate opening") in buildup but purposeful, not muddling closure; no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks designer using rag/mosaic/chant alchemy for hope transforms savior trope via "ambient awareness." Risk in lyric accumulative build to communal pivot feels organic; no derivative templates, memorable final beacon image.</comment>
