<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with myth buster's logic clashing against intangible pull, embodied in urgent cello playing and bittersweet smile; contradictory impulses act in scene ("myth buster... sought something different"); final realization earned via prior causality with visible cost of forsaking concrete proof.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from cello hum to shell glow and CR closure; orientation anchored early at cliff edge; cost legible in "no concrete proof, no tangible artifact, but... courage to embrace the ephemeral."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cello as micro-setting constrains choice (plays it instinctively) and charges final image (glance before leaving); sensory details selective (salty tang, dust, resonant hum) mirror internal states via POV bias; spatial choreography coherent in single room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early, deepens via agency in playing ("fingers moving instinctively... more urgent") narrowing to CR under accumulative lens; cost felt in bittersweet realization foreclosing myth-busting proof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of embracing impermanence emerges organically from particulars (hum, glow, blur of sea/sky); final image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting compass as lived state; grandfather's recalled words integrate without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (logic-tinged lyricism: "dismantling legends... intangible currents"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity (short urgent sentences in playing); no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bow moving faster... summon the answer"); rhythm varies naturally, no loops/artifacts dulling closure; purposeful telling in reflection anchors present without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting cello epiphany transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry; final reconfiguration ("riddle... to be lived") inevitable from priors.</comment>
