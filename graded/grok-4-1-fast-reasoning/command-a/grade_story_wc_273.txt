<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in brother's death compels choices like following the drone and touching the vial, with embodied anger ("burned deep within her") transforming to resolve in tears and resolve. Interior contradiction shows in controlled stance amid flaring anger. Woman's presence forces relational pressure, altering Elara's understanding. Minor slip in stock epiphany phrasing at closure, but earned by prior buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as drone path, tent encounter, and vial touch build density to CR closure: patterns reveal brother's moments, reweighting control to understanding with emotional cost ("Tears welled... didn’t look away"). Orientation anchored early (Elara post-eclipse encampment). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Desert encampment and micro-settings (drone on wrist, vial) constrain choices—drone guides to tent, vial triggers visions—and charge final image ("wind-carved encampment stretching... canvas waiting"). Sensory details selective via tracker POV (glinting wings, scent of ink). Post-eclipse glow recurs purposefully, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover time via ink for brother's crisis) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to vial vision narrowing options from control to confrontation. Agency in pursuit and endurance of vision forecloses rewrite path with felt cost (tears, resolute carry-forward). One deepening sufficient under lens; coherent pressure to Charged Poise end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of confronting inescapable past emerges organically via ink visions reweighting premise, final image ("horizon glowed... courage to face") offering non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in woman's "mirror" line and Elara's transformation avoids tidy binaries. Particulars like patterns drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (wild intensity scanning horizon). Voice texture poetic yet grounded, modulating rhythm in vision ("room seemed to shift"). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("isn’t just a tool... mirror"), distinct voices. Minor elevated diction fits serene tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops or scaffolds. Selective figures ("time spirals," "ephemeral patterns") purposeful without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening descriptions, but integrated into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tracker-drone-ink transforms time-manipulation trope into revelatory mirror, with ink patterns and visions inevitable from setup. Risk in quiet CR payoff heightens emotional specificity over control fantasy.</comment>
