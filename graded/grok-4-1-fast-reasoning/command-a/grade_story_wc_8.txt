<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("emotionally rational") and lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously flatten interior conflict; no micro-choices under pressure reveal flaws, making epiphany feel unearned despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Oriented early with single scene and causal chain from letter to archive; Accumulative/Textural lens holds to CR closure in "deeper understanding" with conceptual cost of truth's nuance legible in final sifting beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ivy-overgrown station and rosebush constrain navigation (debris-buried door, loose floorboard) and charge final image; sensory details (damp earth, decay) weave purposefully into goal-directed action without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early with accumulative deepening via riddle-solving and archive discovery narrowing to stance reconfiguration; cost felt in "fragile balance" realization alters prior certainties.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges implicitly from letter/archive particulars, reweighted non-literally in "humanity behind them" insight; rosebush reprise offers resonant answer to truth/lie tension without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with analytical perceptual signature ("mind worked like a loom") and rhythmic prose modulate effectively; no head-hopping or withholding, diction suits historian.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through discoveries, but minor overwriting (e.g., "loom, weaving together threads") and truth/lie repetitions create slight paraphrase loops in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh inflection on noble lies via historian's solo quest transforms abandoned station tropes; rosebush/letter synthesis feels inevitable, with risk in quiet CR closure heightening nuance.</comment>
