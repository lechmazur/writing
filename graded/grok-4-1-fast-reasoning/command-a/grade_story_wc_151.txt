<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation told flatly ("Her motivation was clear") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in the decoding beat; interiority lacks embodied conflict or micro-choices under time pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with chalk discovery building density to mailbox payoff and CR closure ("futuristic nostalgia wash over her"); legible cost in raced dawn and foreclosed mailing; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Golden arcade, chalk, dawn dew constrain choices (time pressure, coordinates) and charge final image (muted chalk); sensory details selective via Lyra's priorities, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode before mailing) signaled early, tightens via chalk-to-coordinates under Accumulative lens; agency in deciphering but cost (quickened heart, ticking dawn) legible yet low visceral bite at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in margins emerges organically from chalk/letter particulars, reweighted non-literally in nostalgic close; avoids moralizing, lingers via physical-digital contrast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (deliberate chalk); rhythmic texture modulates but elevated diction occasionally drifts from Lyra's inventive lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive clipboard mentions (4x) and code synonyms create minor loops dulling mid-beats; figurative density ("ethereal glow," "masterpiece") overwrites pressure without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Chalk codes as decoding method transforms mail trope freshly; premise synthesis of analog secrets in digital era feels organic and hindsight-inevitable.</comment>
