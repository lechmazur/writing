<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in hesitation over box's "aliveness," but contradictory impulses mostly summarized rather than acted simultaneously; final understanding feels earned yet lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from stranger's box to tether unwind to DC closure ("tether snapped...light returned") with felt cost (chip dulled); journey summary qualifies as motivated ellipsis without breaking options narrowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Covenant cavern's massive gears and rust dust constrain climax work and charge renewal image; sensory details (iron scent, red dust) selectively POV-filtered through repairman's tactile notice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore light) signaled early, tightens via tether/map discovery narrowing repair to journey/freeing; agency in final unwind forecloses tether path with chamber tremble cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Restoration theme emerges organically from "mend what isn’t torn" riddle to climax freeing, reweighting decay/creation balance in final dawn image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with melodic rhythm and gear-focused perceptual signature stable in single POV; sparse dialogue (stranger's gravel voice, tinker's lore) carries subtext and distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates sensory/motif without loops; minor figurative density ("waterfall of stars") in climax but coherent and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosopher's stone chip in rust covenant transforms alchemy trope into balance restoration; risk in "wilts near dishonesty" detection pays off uniquely at closure.</comment>
