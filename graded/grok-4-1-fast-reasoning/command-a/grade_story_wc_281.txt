<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic traits root motivation to create healing art, shown in geode pressed to chest embodying resolve; micro-choices like adjusting equipment reveal values. Interiority concrete in somatic responses but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning to summary epiphanies like "her skepticism was her shield."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: unease builds density through creation to dawn realization as Charged Poise CR, reconfiguring mind pathways with cost in "work was far from over." Orientation anchored early in studio post-static shock; single scene tightens meaningfully via painting's emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Studio vividly integrates: LEDs refract geode patterns constraining composition, charging final "swirling tapestry" image. Sensory hierarchy (shimmer, hum, coolness) reflects Elara's unseen bias; geode as micro-setting enables choices without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to illuminate telepathy fractures escalates accumulatively via night-long creation, deepening to view fractures/potential narrowing options to "call to action." Agency in deliberate setup forces trade-off endurance; cost felt in unresolved healing need charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness-to-resilience emerges organically from geode/painting particulars, final image reweighting fractures as "glowing threads" without moralizing. Subtext in innate vs. flawed telepathy invites ambiguity on human potential; no tidy resolution, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: fractal/unseen bias shapes noticing (geode edges, light whispers). Lyrical voice modulates rhythm with intensity, prose texture distinct in "ethereal hum" diction; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, density high in action-integrated details; minor repetition ("fractally precise," shimmer synonyms) creates subtle pattern without loops. Overwriting in stacked metaphors ("swirling tapestry of blues and silvers that seemed to pulse") borders muddle but ties to light motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light painting as telepathy map post-pill recall, geode/willowglass hope transforming metaphor tropes organically. Risk in invented "willowglass" charges fragile resolve; no template echoes, premise non-obvious.</comment>
