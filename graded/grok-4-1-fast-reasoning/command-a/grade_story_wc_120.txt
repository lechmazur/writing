<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like mapping specific memories onto the shell and whispering despite exhaustion; interior contradiction in longing for unreal time earns the final slump. Minor abstract phrasing ("unheard symphonies") borders stock but ties to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from inscription to harp vibration; on-page Charged Poise closure in shell slipping post-symphony reconfigures homesick soul with felt exhaustion cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake as mirrored horizon and glass spire constrain choices (gazing, fogged breath) and charge final soul-reflection image; sensory details selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphony before exhaustion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via memory-mapping to whispering agency; cost legible in slump, though escalation leans textural over sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mirrored possible-selves emerges organically from shell inscription and horizon pulses; final image resonant reconfiguration answers homesickness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual bias toward spirals/mirrors; stable single POV modulates rhythm for emotional peaks, compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, purposeful figurative layering (shell chambers as heart); minor paraphrase loops in horizon motifs purposeful for textural build, no muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune writer, shell-harp symphony, and mirrored homesickness transforms tropes; risk in lyric activation pays off inevitably at emotional release.</comment>
