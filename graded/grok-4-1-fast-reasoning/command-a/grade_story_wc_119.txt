<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Abstract interiority dominates with stock epiphanies like "sudden surge of clarity" lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation told via metaphors rather than shown through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. No genuine flaws complicate the tidy shift to "conductor of fate." Final decision feels unearned without prior causal buildup of internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via recurring images (fortunes, specs, lighthouse) to Charged Poise closure in "Li Wei's journey began," reconfiguring routine life with conceptual cost of abandoning the known. Orientation anchored early in kitchen. Weak linkage in "accidentally brushing" specs to full awakening lacks motivated ellipsis, but one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kitchen details like "clatter of dishes, the hum of the refrigerator" integrate tactilely into action, mirroring internal shift; lighthouse as recurring image charges final image without overt symbolism. Sensory selection reflects calm urgency narrowing to prophetic sounds. No spatial incoherence despite dream intrusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel mysteries via lighthouse) signaled early but escalates accumulatively via density without narrowing options or agency-driven turn; "surge of clarity" deepens internally but lacks visible trade-off under lens. No opposition tests commitment; cost felt obliquely in life-transposition image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically from particulars (fortunes mirroring specs/dreams), culminating in resonant final image where "fortunes...whispering secrets" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in prophetic accidents invites ambiguity on fate vs. choice. Avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in enigmatic noticing (e.g., "whisper secrets that only a select few could decipher"); rhythmic modulation suits accumulative build but drifts to elevated diction. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("seemed to," "as if") and paraphrase loops (lighthouse "calling"/"beckoning"/"guiding" across paragraphs) create template cadence, dulling propulsion; mixed metaphors (orchestra/maestro/symphony/key) muddle in peak clarity beat. Density fair but overwriting obscures some cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune writer + spy specs + dream lighthouse transforms espionage tropes into metaphorical self-discovery; "microdot film specs" as open-secret metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold metaphorical risk heightens without gimmickry.</comment>
