<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (fear of release vs. leaf's urging) build to earned surrender; micro-choices like pressing leaf to chest reveal values under pressure. Minor diagnostic slips ("reluctant metamorphosis") feel unearned in peak realization. Final rearrangement forecloses control path with felt lightness/cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and pattern (storm mirroring turmoil) tighten to Charged Poise closure where leaf dissolves and nursery shifts, reconfiguring stance with emotional cost legible in "drenched...lighter." Single scene oriented early (nursery edge, storm); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mossy trellis evolves from barrier to gateway, constraining release (leaning at end recharges it); rain, wet earth scents narrow perception purposefully under crisis. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's priorities; details propel via tactile integration (shimmering leaf edges).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. surrender) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via leaf pulse/storm intensification forcing rearrangement agency; cost felt in resolve cracking and drenched lightness foreclosing safe cage. One deepening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis emerges organically from particulars (leaf as mirror, plants whispering); final image (sunlight smile) resonantly reweights control premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on change's fear/liberation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (nature as chaotic solace) biases noticing; diction/rhythm modulate with intensity (short sentences in rain peak). No dialogue; clean free indirect avoids leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax matches emotional cadence; high density in sensory lines. Minor paraphrase loops ("chaos" early, "control" repetitions) drag slightly but avoid closure; no artifacts dull ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nursery control as cage with leaf catalyst transforms epiphany trope via textured nature immersion. Risky lyric accumulation heightens internal stakes without gimmick.</comment>
