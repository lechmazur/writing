<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength in Kael's embodied reactions like trembling hands and surging emotions during duel; weakness in diagnostic labels like "emotional rebirth" and listed feelings ("fear, anger, sadness, joy") that feel unearned mid-crisis, flattening interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds: Lira's approach and swords propel duel to decisive change at "Kael shattered the jar," with legible emotional cost as numbness lifts; single scene anchors orientation early, one tightening via intensifying duel suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective details like dojo's hum, jar's cool glass, and dissolving walls to void constrain duel stakes and charge final merger image; sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's fractured focus without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of integration vs. numbness tightens via duel agency, narrowing to shatter/merge with on-page cost in emotional waves; coherent pressure under causal lens forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites emerges organically via yin/yang swords and self-duel, resonating in non-literal merger without moralizing; final image reweights premise of duplicate autonomy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with consistent mystical texture; Lira's dialogue carries subtext and distinction ("life cannot exist without death"), advancing goal without expository ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to peak, but minor paraphrase loops around "battle" (custody, internal, timeless) and elevated diction like "slices through pretense" drag momentum slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego-death clone duel in timeless dojo transforms tropes via grounded merger; risk in brain's responsive "movements" heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
