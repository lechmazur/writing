<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eliard's earnest persistence and naive belief drive consistent choices, embodied in steady hands despite "plausible impossibility." Internal conflict emerges mildly through doubts about family fragility, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal rebuild beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density to cadence shift at waves rising; closure as Charged Poise with cost in "work far from over" and trembling hands legible on final page. Orientation anchored early at viaduct edge; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's dew dripping and glow constrain method and charge final intensified hum, mirroring internal hope. Sensory details selective via POV urgency, evolving with sun's climb; micro-setting as tool integrates fully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to right imbalance signaled early, tightens accumulatively via faint ring forcing world response under lens. Agency in ritual endurance forecloses doubt with visible cost in scarred bell and ongoing task, but lacks sharper option-narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Brittle devotion and restoration theme emerges organically from bell's scar and waves, offering non-literal resonance in "one dripping rate at a time." Complexity lingers in partial mend without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in dripping rhythm and hum; voice lyrical, modulating with ritual intensity. No head-hopping; diction biased to naive pattern-seeking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, propelling rebuild; high density integrates sensory into action. Minor "brittle" repetition doesn't obscure closure image of hanging bell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Understanding dripping rates" synthesizes fresh magical ingenuity from tactile patterns, transforming cosmic restoration trope via grounded persistence to inevitable quiet shift.</comment>
