<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's rational traits drive precise foraging and hesitation with the eye, earning the ritual choice; internal conflict embodied in clamped mouth after blurted truth. Minor therapy-speak like "cultivate psychological safety" feels diagnostic rather than dramatized mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery causes truthfulness therefore village quest therefore ritual DC with eye graying and calm return as legible cost in foreclosed control. Orientation anchored by ~100 words in orchard; one tightening via Mara's lore narrows to dawn ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard roots/shadows constrain digging inciting incident; ravine damp air and storm-battered branches mirror fractured states, charging final exhale. Sensory hierarchy via forager's soil-brushing and bee hum selective to Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (neutralize eye's curse) signaled early, tightens causally via blurted truth and Mara's warning forcing ritual agency; cost legible in "weight lifted" reweighting safety. No reversal overload, but village shard escalates knowledge without new complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of chosen truths emerges from eye's burden to final lesson without statement; orchard's "fractured grace restored" reconfigures premise non-literally. Resonance in truffle smile tying safety to buried secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual bias (scent-focused, rational weighing); dialogue natural/subtextual in Mara's whisper and hesitant ritual words. Rhythm modulates from deliberate precision to ritual calm without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like trowel strike uncovering eye; varied rhythm in ritual chant. Minor paraphrase loop in "fractured grace" repetitions dulls closure image slightly (−0.4 non-closure cap applied).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-virus world, truth-curse eye, and orchard ritual transforms relic trope via forager's grounded choices. Risk in Latin ritual pays off without gimmick.</comment>
