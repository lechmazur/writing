<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Traveler's motivation rooted in talisman thread and purpose compels micro-choices like intimate approach and obituary-writing; woman's waiting reveals blind spot endurance. Strong embodied emotion in observations, but minor archetypal mysticism hedges flaws. Exchange earns change with relational cost in tears and gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to obituary-reading, culminating in thread exchange as Charged Poise RR with legible emotional cost in woman's weeping and traveler's enriched tapestry. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Autumn garden details (crisp air, fallen leaves, filtering sunlight) selectively mirror absences, constrain choice of site, and charge final starry image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (scents evoke loss). Shadows evolve, guiding intimate encounter without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explaining absences via obits) signaled early, deepens accumulatively in woman's revelation to writing/reading, narrowing to mutual transformation. Cost felt in tears and foreclosed waiting; agency in traveler's projection and gift acceptance. Minor abstractness in "geography" but charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformed absences emerges via obituary and threads weaving tapestry, reweighting premise in final image without statement. Subtext in silences and gift implies healing complexity. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like palace threads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in vivid, biased noticing (shadows as secrets). Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm to emotional peaks. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in woman's waiting admission.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels accumulatively; metaphors consistent (tapestry, threads) without muddle or loops. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs, but purposeful for tone and untouched at closure exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise of living obituaries transforms loss tropes via thread exchanges and garden witness; non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable in tapestry finale. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes organically.</comment>
