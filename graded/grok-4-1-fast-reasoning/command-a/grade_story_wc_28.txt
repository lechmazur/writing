<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via mosaic actions, with gentle radicalism earning final endurance; interiority concrete in embodied warmth at end, but diagnostic labels like "retrocognitively trapped" and "cradle empathy in arms of steel" reduce contradiction to telling over simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with early anchors (plaza post-fire by para 1); closure via CR in final mosaic image reconfigures aberrant mercy with felt cost of "tireless" resolve; one tightening from reflection to rearranging suffices, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic tessera as micro-setting constrains choices (tracing to rearranging) and charges final image; sensory details (acrid tang, dust on hands) selective via POV past-bias; evolves causally from chipped/ashed to renewed without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rename mercy essential) signaled early, accumulates via deepening reflection-action loop under textural lens; agency in rearranging forecloses force-rebuild path with visible effort cost, but external pressure abstract without on-page test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from mosaic shift (broken sky to healing), final image offers resonant CR reweighting mercy without moralizing; subtext in fleeting past mercies layers complexity, avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (past overlays present objects); voice texture modulates rhythmically from reflective to purposeful in peak rearranging; purposeful compression of reflection legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and high density propel via image integration; minor paraphrase loops on "renaming" and "mercy" (-0.4) not obscuring closure; no filter stacks or figurative muddle in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh non-obvious synthesis of mosaic-renaming transforms post-fire renewal trope; "retrocognitively trapped" and "aberrant mercy" particularize emotional arc; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
