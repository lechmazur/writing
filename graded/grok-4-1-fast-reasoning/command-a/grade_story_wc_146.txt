<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in patience drives actions, but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; Elias reads as stock mystic without internal conflict shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build via town responses culminating in RR closure (bell rings with felt patience cost); orientation anchored early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (pine scent, cobblestone echoes) integrate with action; archway and stones constrain starting ritual and charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival via rhythm) signaled early with accumulative tightening through vine retreat and clearer echoes; agency in patient steps, cost legible in time endured but lacks sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via patience emerges organically from rhythmic actions and town reawakening; final bell offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of subtle vibrations; rhythmic prose fits mystical tone, no head-hopping, though some elevated diction borders opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("rhythm," "steps") across walking beats dull propulsion (−0.6); otherwise varied rhythm and density support lyric accumulative drive, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist premise transforms ghost town trope via footsteps-as-revival; tuning fork and rhythm synthesis feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
