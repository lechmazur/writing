<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in yearning to mend connections, embodied in trembling touch; weakness in abstract epiphany ("empathy was not about erasing boundaries") lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to surge and CR closure in dawn image; cost legible in "struggled to ground himself" and dimmed fragment; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Workshop shelves and open starry ceiling constrain experiment and charge final dawn shift; sensory glow pulses with heartbeat, mirroring internal chaos purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake of deciphering emotion math tightens via deliberate touch into overwhelm reversal; endurance agency forecloses total dissolution with ragged gasps as on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of expanded empathy emerges organically from surge and realization; final cradling image offers non-literal reweighting of boundaries without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature of blurring identities; lyrical diction modulates intensity at "edges of his identity soften."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak with stacked metaphors ("chorus of voices... tapestry") slightly dulls surge clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Halo fragment transforms letterpress mysticism into fresh emotion conduit; borrowing personalities inflects disorientation uniquely toward CR.</comment>
