<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hesitation between logic and intuition at the flame effectively embodies internal conflict and compels the altar choice. Final shift to harmony feels earned by prior micro-choices like tracing starling patterns. Sentimental trait is told early without constraining a pivotal action, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds from starlings to flame-crystal interaction, culminating in CR closure ("boundaries...softening") with legible internal cost. Single scene coheres with no orientation debt; pattern-taught progression to altar tightens without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's dew-kissed grass, ancient tree roots, and waterfall constrain path to grove and altar, charging final "sigh in approval." Sensory details selectively mirror Elara's pursuit, evolving causally from golden glow to shimmering vibrancy without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harmonize logic/intuition signaled early and deepens via flame interruption forcing agency at altar. Accumulative escalation reweights through pattern intensification (starlings return), with felt cost in internal boundaries softening. No agency-driven reversal but cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges organically from crystal-flame union and starling symphony, answered non-literally by final image of woven wonder without moralizing. Particulars like spirals/arrows avoid platitudes; resonance reweights premise via Elara's shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV with alchemist-specific perceptual bias toward patterns and symbols. Rhythm modulates from quiet footsteps to shimmering climax; purposeful compression in realization beat enhances immersion without elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Purple flourishes like "kaleidoscopic waterfall" and "dew-kissed grass" verge on cliché, with mild paraphrase loops in ending ("logic and intuition" repetitions dull propulsion). Density high overall, but figurative density in climax risks overwriting without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms alchemist quest via starling code and flame-crystal alchemy into harmony metaphor. Risky lyric Accumulative design heightens stakes through environmental agency without gimmickry; irreplaceable particulars like dew crystal avoid template tropes.</comment>
