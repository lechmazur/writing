<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in tangential traits, intensifying to internal shift; warmly observant trait enables absorption of time layers without judgment. Interiority concrete via cicada sensations (warm, hum in chest), but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal cicada beat. Change credible but borders unearned epiphany in "realized the cicada was... a key."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observation to overlapping fragments to cicada activation. Closure as CR via motivation shift ("no longer sought... but to become"), with felt cost in metamorphosis analogy and heartbeat sync in final lines. Orientation anchored early (grotto, cicada); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory selective (stars pulsing, moss, cicada cool-to-warm); grotto mirrors internal breath-holding and whispers encouragement. Jade cicada as micro-setting constrains revelation and charges final image (hum synchronized with heartbeat). Details purposeful, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (validate tangential vs. linear) signaled early, textural escalation via deepening layers ("fragments... coexisted") narrows to realization. Agency in closing eyes/expanding senses forces trade-off (internal validation over direct focus). Cost legible in shift foreclosing prior pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (truth in detours/tangential tapestry) emerges organically from cicada patterns and time strata, resonating in final image without statement. Subtext in criticized method proving strength via revelation. Complexity lingers in Kael gap bridged prospectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable, perceptual signature warmly observant (tracing carvings, sensing shifts). Voice textured with rhythmic modulation (short sensory bursts to expansive insights); diction purposeful, lyric without opacity. No dialogue; elision of conversation pause taught early, paid in return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring insight buildup; rhythm breathes with scene (calm observation to pulsing stars). Minor figurative density ("celestial tapestry," "strata") in opening risks overwrite but patterns texturally without muddle. Slight paraphrase loop in "foresaw" repetitions across revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chronicler mysticism and cicada-time unlocking transforms introspection trope. Tangential method as strength subverts criticism organically; bold textural lens on time feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in abstract premise grounded by cicada specificity.</comment>
