<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to break free intensifies credibly through discoveries, culminating in earned shift at photo reveal; interiority concrete via embodied quickening heart and faltering calm. Contradictory impulses (calm exterior vs. internal storm) act in scene without alternation. Minor stock phrasing like "fortified vulnerability" slightly genericizes but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries (fissure, journal, symbols, photo) tightens knowledge toward Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early (Elara in tunnel post-collapse). Cost legible in "treacherous road ahead" with conceptual price of freedom reconfiguring stance; no Orientation Test penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lantern as micro-setting constrains choices (reveals scratches, flickers responsively) and charges final image brighter at emergence. Sensory hierarchy vivid/selective: rust/damp anchors urgency, shadows mirror internal states through action. Spatial choreography coherent in single tunnel progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover pattern/break mentor control) signaled early, escalates via photo tightening that forces stance reconfiguration under Accumulative lens. Agency in prying/pushing walls forecloses doubt path with felt cost (faltering calm). One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of past warnings enabling freedom emerges organically from journal/photo particulars, resonating in final dawn smile reweighting mentor control without moralizing. Subtext in shifting shadows/lantern implies entangled pasts charging closure. No Thematic Echo; ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (empirical scrutiny of marks/residue) biased by profession; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences in fissure pry). Elevated diction consistent/voice-motivated, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but overwriting via figurative density ("fortified vulnerability," "reverberation deafening") in discovery beats dulls slightly (−0.4); minor paraphrase loops (calm repetitions). High density integrates action/atmosphere; closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of investigator trope via Underground Railroad lantern and mentor photo betrayal transforms familiarity; final emergence reconfigures independence organically. Risks poetic tone effectively without gimmickry; no close famous echoes.</comment>
