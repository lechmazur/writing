<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in mapping dreams to uncover "what trees witness," but interior conflict relies on summary realizations like "Elias realized the sextant was a mirror" rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream fragments build density to CR closure: sextant whole and labyrinth "lighter" with conceptual cost of acknowledged sorrow legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlight and sextant as micro-setting constrain healing action and charge final image of gleaming brass, with sensory details (silver stone, soft glow) filtered through Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovery tightens via dream coalescence and sextant mending under lens, narrowing to reweighted knowledge with felt weight of sorrow; agency in deconstruction drives deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of quantified sorrow healing emerges organically from dream fragments and sextant, resonating in final "sorrow made whole" without moralizing, though borders platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature on patterns/dreams; rhythm modulates effectively, as in whispering walls thickening air.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "sorrow" repetitions (e.g., "vessel of sorrow... sorrow of every dreamer") slightly dull peak density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphorical "trees witness" via dream-labyrinth synthesis transforms relic trope organically, with risk-taking in accumulative healing arc feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
