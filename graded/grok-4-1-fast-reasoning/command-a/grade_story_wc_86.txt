<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choices with the drawer pull and empathetic dialogue reveal consistent traits under pressure; Kael's nod feels earned through relational crucible. Internal conflict is embodied via cold air and hand-turning ritual. Minor label-speak ("uncommonly thoughtful nature") slightly abstracts embodiment without peak harm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmospheric density and symbolic beats build to Charged Poise closure with drawer pull handoff and Kael's reserved nod as felt cost ("I do not forgive lightly"). Orientation anchored early in parapet/mist setup. Single scene causality intact, no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist and storm-worn parapet constrain negotiation via biting wind and swirling witness, mirroring internal tension; drawer pull charges final image as micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy (visual lantern flicker, tactile cold) filters through Elara's priorities. No white-room; evolves causally with mist parting/thickening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging mistrust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dialogue reversals narrowing to Kael's nod; agency in Elara's proposal forecloses blame cycle with relational cost legible in his "not lightly." One decisive deepening suffices. Pressure coheres without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes emerges via drawer pull's reprise, reweighting apology/forgiveness; subtext in silences and shadows. Direct articulation ("recycle our mistakes into wisdom") echoes thesis, flattening resonance in pivotal proposal line. Complexity lingers in Kael's reservation without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (moon-aligned rhythm, object-grounding); dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishes voices (Elara poetic, Kael rough). Rhythmic modulation builds tension. No head-hopping; diction fits thoughtful negotiator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for storm cadence. Minor figurative density ("mist clung like forgotten secrets") risks overwrite in opening without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Moon phases and drawer pull as treaty relic transform diplomacy trope via textured symbolism; fresh "seeds in neutral territory" angle. Risk in poetic staging heightens stakes. Organic synthesis feels particular, not template.</comment>
