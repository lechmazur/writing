<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength in embodied micro-choices like boots sinking and trembling hands revealing motivation under subtle pressure; weakness in tidy emotional progression lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses, with final restoration reading as summary ("sense of belonging, a purpose") rather than dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of discoveries tightening to tomb opening as RR/CR closure; cost legible in "shattered by years of wandering" reweighted by mural image; orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard with roots snaking bones constrains wandering choices and charges final chamber image; sensory details (soft earth, golden hue) selective via POV bias, mirroring internal restoration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (faith restoration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern-deepening (roots shifting, hollow discovery) narrowing to base placement; cost felt in interrupted doubts foreclosed by on-page agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical restoration emerges organically from orchard roots, sundial symbols, and mural cycle answering interrupted journeys without statement; final tracing lines recharges particulars with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of curious attunement to land's rhythm; diction modulates poetically under growing enchantment without register drift or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("purposeful wandering," "warmly curious" repeated across beats) dull density slightly; strong rhythmic variety and propulsion in discovery sequence, but overwriting in descriptive peaks ("whispers growing louder, shadows softer").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard as life-death continuum transforms ancestral return trope; mural as faith map offers non-obvious cyclical reweighting grown from setting particulars.</comment>
