<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eli's motivation rooted in curiosity and engineering traits drives consistent actions like experimenting with vents, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority tells "stoic wonder" without embodied conflict in pivotal idea-strike beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to transformation; clear orientation by para 1; CR closure lands in dawn final image with implied all-night effort cost, reweighting hope via reinvention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "cracked tiles and torn banners" and "air flowed through broken vents" filter through engineer's systems view, constraining choices in experimentation; recurring shadows/mirrors charge final vitality illusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of puzzling hope tightens accumulatively via idea strike ("what if he could redirect the flows"), narrowing from assessment to resurrection with visible effort cost by dawn; agency in rigging vents/speakers forecloses passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of navigating intentions emerges organically from sextant/engraving to terminal-as-story realization, with final image offering non-literal answer on resurrection's hope equation; ambiguity lingers in deferred dreams without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "systems, networks of cause and effect"; rhythmic prose modulates from fascination to wonder; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "patterns" and "maze of intentions" across experimentation beat dull density slightly; rhythm varies but elevated diction like "labyrinth, its corridors and gates" borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ruin exploration into active resurrection via engineering flows transforms abandoned trope; risk in spaceport/carnival collision feels organic, charging closure hindsight.</comment>
