<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's acoustically perceptive nature and drive for beauty in the unfinished root clear motivation, with embodied hesitation in hesitant notes evolving to decisive play and speech. Internal conflict surfaces in itch to play held back by hush, resolved with earned realization. Minor summary in family backstory slightly dilutes micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory hush density builds to pattern break in swelling notes awakening shipwrecks/greenhouse, culminating in Charged Poise RR where hush reconfigures as muse. Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene coherent. Cost legible in "weight of those memories" and bowl's deliberate return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (creaking shipwrecks, fractured glass humming, ashen soil) filter through Elara's acoustic bias, constraining play (hush swallows sound) and charging closure image of bowl reburied. Environment evolves causally with music, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fill chronic hush, find beauty) signaled early; Accum lens escalation via density increase from hesitation to swelling tapestry awakening world, narrowing to verbal unbinding. Agency in violin retrieval/play/speech forecloses fear path; felt cost in memory weight, but no secondary loss sharpens further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished/resilience emerges organically from hush-as-canvas, bowl memories, and final expectant silence reweighting loss. Resonant non-literal closure in Elara's smile and departure answers premise without moralizing; particulars like bonfire tradition layer complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with acoustic perceptual signature (whispers of wind, hum of insects, groaning shipwrecks); lyrical rhythm modulates from tentative to swelling without head-hopping. Prose texture distinct in sensory bias and purposeful compression; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion (short hesitant sentences to swelling clauses); minor overwriting in "tapestry of sound" and "dance of reflections" in peak play beat slightly muddles without obscuring. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; clean grammar and specificity propel to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire silence, acoustic violinist, and mendicant bowl transforms tropes into organic post-apocalyptic lyricism; shipwreck-greenhouse setting and hush-muse turn feel inevitable from particulars. Risky quiet closure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
