<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via discoveries, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; analytic trait shown in untangling journal and map, yet epiphany at letter feels diagnostic rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artifacts build density to CR closure when Elara places globe down, reweighting silence with conceptual cost of impermanence; orientation anchored early in sunken library.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (damp plank, silt-buried box, colder air) selectively guide choices via map; recurring snow globe as micro-setting constrains final release and charges ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding letting go) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through artifacts; realization forces renunciation with on-page cost as library shifts from tomb to lullaby.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from sailor’s artifacts; final globe shake and placement offers resonant CR without moralizing, though letter’s phrasing borders overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias toward analytic details; voice modulates melancholic rhythm effectively, prose texture distinct in sensory filters like "brittle and faintly luminous" pages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/description; minor paraphrase loop in reflective blocks ("not sadness, exactly, but...") but no closure harm or artifacts in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken library artifacts and Bermuda sailor transforms letting-go trope; globe-Bermuda link and Earhart backstory yield non-obvious premise without derivative echoes.</comment>
