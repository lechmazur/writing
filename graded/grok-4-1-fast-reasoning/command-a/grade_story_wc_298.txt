<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's reckless idealism drives planting and carving despite warnings, with contradictory reverence in her "fiercely gentle" hands; shadow confrontation forces earned renunciation of freedom. Minor slip in tidy epiphany at "This was her purpose," but micro-choices under pressure (tremor vs steady tone) reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wandering to chamber encounter, culminating in Earned Stasis closure where Elara forecloses escape with felt cost ("until there’s nothing left of me"). Orientation anchored early; pattern of roots/card ties causality without breaks. Cost legible in final choice line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots constrain choice (tug resists sapling, forms pattern), charging final image of walls/roots as woven meaning. Sensory selection (earth/decay scent, reluctant glow) reflects Elara's priorities, integrated via action. No white-room; spatial coherence in corridors to chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend souls vs binding debt) signaled early, tightens via shadow's accusation forcing stance crystallization; agency in "I’ll stay" with visible cost under Accumulative lens. Escalation coheres without reversals needed; moral calculus between self-sacrifice and freedom sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-as-currency emerges organically from inlaying actions and barter nexus, reweighted in figure's "destinies…meant to be lived" without moralizing. Final image of carving/planting answers choice-over-barter question resonantly. Subtext in shadow as unflinching alternate self adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (earth/decay grounding her); voice modulates dusky resolve in dialogue subtext ("Isn’t that what we agreed?"). Natural dialogue pursues goals, distinguishes selves; no head-hopping, rhythmic control under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, propulsion via image-embedded action; minor paraphrase loop in "fiercely gentle" phrasing but no closure touch. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard as living nexus transforms bartered-destiny trope via roots-as-veins and shadow-self crucible. Risk in quiet stasis closure heightens stakes organically; no derivative hedging, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
