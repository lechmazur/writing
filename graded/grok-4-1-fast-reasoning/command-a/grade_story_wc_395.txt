<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via discoveries, compelling the lie and final decision; brightly attentive trait enables pattern-spotting but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Final choice to expose feels earned by escalating commitment, with career cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (numbers, song sync) builds to CR closure in final paragraph where Elara memorizes coordinates and steps out, reweighting absence with personal cost (exposure risk). One tightening post-lockout via bypass; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Archive as micro-setting constrains via lockout and forces offline bypass; patch recurs to charge final image in hand. Sensory hierarchy (digital scans, song melody, static) reflects attentive POV bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover deleted files' truth) signaled early, tightens via lockout reversal narrowing options to lie/bypass; agency in micro-choices forecloses safe routine path, with job/exposure cost felt in decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of filling voids emerges organically from patterns and "sensed absence" mirroring crew's disappearance; final image ("across the echo of forgotten songs, the truth would finally be heard") offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-attuned noticing; rhythmic control modulates from scanning calm to "heart raced" stress. No dialogue; purposeful elision of supervisor exchange keeps focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops on "numbers" and "sensed absence" but no scaffold obscuring closure image. Propulsion clear in action-integrated details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archive as cosmic message board via numbers/song sync transforms cold case trope; risk in elliptical discoveries pays off in hindsight at CR ending.</comment>
