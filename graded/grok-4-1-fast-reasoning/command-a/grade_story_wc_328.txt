<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like clutching the arrowhead amid chaos; earned shift from bitterness via laughter moment. Minor abstract phrasing ("harmony untamed") dilutes interior specificity slightly. Final renunciation of control feels motivated by prior grief anchors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from search to phone trigger to alcove CR via laughter resetting garden with legible emotional cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherence intact. Closure CR reconfigures stance undeniably on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (ozone scent, rippling walls) constrains choices, like arrowhead pull to alcove; garden evolution mirrors internal shift, charging final reset image. Micro-setting (pool reflection) forces confrontation payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove cryptid origins amid grief) tightens via phone/metamorphose reversal, narrowing to internal endurance; laughter crystallizes stance with foreclosed control path. Cost felt in "letting go of the bitterness"; lens escalation via density suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of untamed harmony emerges organically from cryptid connection and laughter epiphany as non-literal answer to bitterness. Final image reweights quest without moralizing. Subtle ambiguity in cosmic joke lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (e.g., arrowhead as "alive and whispering"); rhythmic prose modulates tension. Distorted phone dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing plot without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor overwrite in metaphors ("frostbitten hope," repeated "shift") creates slight template cadence in mid-beats. Closure image clear; no loops dulling peak laugh. Varied rhythm supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid lore, dimensional arrowhead, and static phone transforms tropes into emotional ingenuity; laughter as cosmic joke turn inevitable from particulars. Risky surrealism heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
