<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in past silence, intensifying to compel reading own letter; embodied emotions like skin prickling and heart racing ground her. Interior conflict told more than shown simultaneously acting. Final wholeness earned via shard's energy at climax, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of shard interactions, messages, spirits' songs builds to RR closure when Elara reads her letter and feels whole, with legible emotional cost in confronting regret. Orientation anchored early in mangrove under moonlight. Single continuous scene with meaningful deepening at pedestal recognition; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like twisted roots and humming air filter through Elara's purpose; mangrove subtly guides to clearing and grove, constraining path. Moonlight pools and fogged windows charge key beats. Spirits' songs evolve causally, mirroring internal shift at silent note.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock regrets signaled early, tightens via map to own letter recognition narrowing options. Agency in pressing shard and breaking seal drives escalation under Accumulative lens. Visible emotional cost in raced heart and wholeness reweights stake at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apologies emerges organically via messages like "You were never too late" and own letter; final image of shard dull but warm offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids tidy morals but quotes verge on platitude. Protagonist arc inextricable from evoking regrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct lyrical texture in syntax and biased noticing of shard symbols, spirits' melodies. Rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure; purposeful compression legible under lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing mood and action; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor figurative density in opening (roots as fingers, air hummed) without muddle, but "singing spirits" recurs without new pressure. Clean grammar, no loops obscuring closure image of warm shard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical shard unlocking personal regrets in mangrove transforms apology trope via concrete messages and own handwriting turn. Risks lyric accumulation paying off in wholeness; no derivative templates, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
