<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove her theory drives consistent micro-choices like hovering hands and communing, culminating in an earned shift to humility with embodied trembling and aching heart. Interiority feels particular through mystic lens on frost patterns, avoiding stock phrasing until the realization's slight diagnostic edge ("lesson in humility"). No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, blocking 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from preparation to resonance to grief discovery, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in "emotions absorbed... were stories, lives, memories" with humility cost felt in trembling hands and changed stance. Single scene oriented early (arbor, mist, prism by para 1). No orientation debt; lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor's hum and mist amplify energies, constraining her communion by muting sound and grounding her at center; prism facets charge final image as she cradles it on bench. Sensory hierarchy mystic-specific (frost patterns, refracted hues). Details evolve causally with mist clearing, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove emotion absorption) signaled early tightens accumulatively: silence to faint resonance to intense grief narrows options, forcing realization trade-off with emotional cost in "heart aching." Agency in persistent communing drives deepening; cost legible in duality of beauty/pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of objects bearing human stories emerges organically from prism's grief reveal, reweighting premise in final "truthful lies" image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like creator's loss inferred through her fragments. Invites ambiguity in enduring imprints charging quiet ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with mystic perceptual signature (emotions as frost language, resonances). Voice modulates rhythmically from steady breath to snapping eyes under pressure. No elision or head-hopping; diction purposeful in poetic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax and sensory integration; high density in communion beat ("faint resonance... whisper"). Minor figurative density in peak ("shadows," "rainbows") risks overwrite but pattern-taught as mystic lens without muddle. No loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic empiricism (frost as emotional map) transforms inanimate communion trope into profound CR on "truthful lies." Risk in abstract premise paid via embodied discovery and prism reprise. No derivative echoes; ingenuity in grief backstory emergence.</comment>
