<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via cork inhalation to following the figure, earning realization; embodied emotions like chest ache show contradiction. Interiority concrete but slips into abstract "screaming tenderness" without full embodiment. Final change credible endurance of silence with cost of prior doubts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (scent/vibrations) builds to CR at "He had proven what he needed to prove," reweighting intent with felt cost of overcome doubts. Orientation anchored early (lighthouse/dawn/Elias). One tightening via inhalation changes perception/options; holds to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details selective (jasmine/damp earth guiding to grove) constrain choices like following; dawn light/shore evolve with action. Lighthouse/sea charge final image of beacon as intention. Mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers&gt;shouts) signaled early, deepens via cork/figure to crystallize stance; cost legible in purified doubts foreclosing noisy path. Under Accumulative lens, density reweights with agency in inhaling/following.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of subtle intent emerges via particulars (cork/scent/figure), but woman's direct line "Whispers travel farther than shouts" is thematic echo, flattening subtext in climax. Final image resonantly reconfigures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with scent-biased perceptual signature; voice modulates rhythmically from quiet ascent to urgent descent. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, advances realization cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in descent); density high, but minor overwriting in "screaming tenderness" and repeated scent phrasing dulls peak. No loops/artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical cork/lighthouse solitude transforms quiet epiphany trope; risk in surreal guide heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from vibrations motif.</comment>
