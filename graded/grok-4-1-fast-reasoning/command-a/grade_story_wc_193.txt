<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pyramid scheme backstory anchors motivation to rebuild but remains a told label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; virtuously mischievous trait surfaces in final grin but lacks simultaneous impulses in pivotal portal entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through message → portal → machine chain with on-page CR closure in return and gleaming bolt reconfiguring past pressures into hope; one tightening at bolt fitting slot narrows options with felt hesitation cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm and concept-physical dimension vividly constrain choices, as mushroom pedestal enables portal and pressure wall tests Elara; final farm return with bolt charges image under causal lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to translate pressure emerges early via messages, tightens at machine activation forcing trade-off with invisible wall; cost legible in crystallized promises but lacks deeper agency-driven reversal beyond compliance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing past pressures into diamonds emerges organically from machine output and future-self reveal without statement; final grin and work setup offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with whimsical perceptual signature suits tone; dialogue sparse but subtextual in messages and being's chorus advances plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varying sentences but minor overwriting in "towers of time beside rivers of memory" mixes metaphors without payoff; no loops, high density integrates action with glow/pulse details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mushroom farm portal and concept-physical world transforms portal trope via bolt-machine causality; risk in parallel self pays off at closure without gimmick.</comment>
