<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via vibrations and heat-map colors; contradictory melancholy/hope/determination layer credibly; earned shift from rectification to embrace, compelled by Kael's collaborative pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density building to CR closure; Kael's knock provides one meaningful tightening; final fork strike makes conceptual cost (accepting muffled thoughts) legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (damp earth, frosted ferns) filters through Elara's priorities; winterglass dawn charges final image, subtly mirroring defiance; coherent choreography in single scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, tightens via Kael's pattern discovery under accumulative lens; agency in endurance to harmony forecloses rectification path with felt impossibility cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of marvels in silence emerges implicitly through failed attempts and emotional harmony; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (vibrations over sound); rhythmic modulation suits lyric tone; signing described naturally as goal-driven action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Varied syntax propels with high density; purposeful figuratives (frozen waterfalls) integrate without muddle; minor "silence" repetition purposeful but borders loop in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh post-Noise premise transformed via heat-mapping and felt vibrations; conceptual repricing feels inevitable from established patterns; risks silence-world specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
