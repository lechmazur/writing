<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's grip tightening on chain during Kael's news reveals embodied resolve under pressure, earning her shift to communal action; minor abstract tells like "balancedly curious" dilute contradiction depth without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as personal curiosity densifies to communal ritual and final resonance CR, with chain's vibration as charged poise reconfiguration bearing conceptual cost of inward expansion; time jumps legible without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chain link recurs tactilely from warm relic to pedestal symbol to bone-resonating vibe, constraining harbor rituals and charging closure image; benthic city's edge geometry filters via Elara's star bias purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Council decommissioning signals dominant stake early, texturally tightening via her ritual that hybridizes old/new with felt fear cost; one deepening suffices but lacks sharper option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emerging hybrid geometry from star-alien patterns reweights stars/depths tension non-literally in ritual and final resonance, tying protagonist arc to thematic bridge without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature prioritizes stellar constancy amid abyssal glows; Kael dialogue carries subtextual pressure naturally, distinguishing voices without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and sensory propulsion build density without loops; minor fig-lang density in opening ("veins", "compass needle") borders overwrite but integrates without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aliens-from-abyss unfolding benthic-star navigation transforms discovery tropes via hybrid geometry synthesis; chain's resonance inflects fresh inward horizon angle organically.</comment>
