<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied grief (hands stilled, trembling unfold) with contradictory craft-vs-feel impulses acting in basilica scene; earned change via prior denial culminates in crane unfolding. Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing ("man he was becoming") avoids deeper flaw impact on closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density tightening to basilica RR (shadow as shield realization reconfigures grief); orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "unfurl[ing] crease a memory" with island's rise. One meaningful deepening via Lira's prompt suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Basilica constrains pivotal choice (reveals shadow) and charges final image (light softens embrace); sensory hierarchy (mist rustle, gem dullness) filters via Kael's priorities, mirroring internal descent without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform vs. feel grief) deepens accumulatively via Lira dialogue and basilica visit, narrowing to renunciation; agency in unfolding forecloses craft-escape path with felt emotional cost on-page. Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief's release emerges organically from origami/crane particulars, reweighted in final lantern honor without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in island's rise and smile recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (light as judgment/mockery); voice rhythmic and biased (craft hollow); Lira dialogue subtextual ("not meant to be folded"), natural and advancing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but dense figuratives ("mist clung like lover’s whisper," "paradoxical motion") border overwriting in opening without obscuring closure; no loops or scaffolds dull basilica propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-lantern craft, origami grief, detached shadow in floating isle world transforms loss trope; risk in lyric accumulative closure (crane unfold) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
