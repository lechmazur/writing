<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in clock-maker traits drives methodical actions to the climax; neatly inventive mind shown in yoyo disassembly aligning with stone symbols. Interiority concrete via "bleak exhilaration" and trembling hands post-flash, embodying unease. Final endurance of consequences feels earned without unmotivated epiphany; minor flaw in under-shown internal contradiction caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens: dismantling yoyo therefore matches symbols, glow therefore escalates to flash and lighthouse reversal as tide turns. Orientation anchored early (Elias at lighthouse base, low tide). On-page DC closure via "gears turning counter-clockwise" with cost in "no going back"; single tightening sufficient but lacks hairline constraint for 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory (salt/decay, rocky spine exposed) filters through Elias's inventive gaze, constraining via embedded stone and tide's return. Lighthouse interior (rusted gears, shattered glass) mirrors his clocks and charges reversal image. Environment subtly pressures ("island resisting") without overt symbolism; recurring stone/tide evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock stone to bend time) signaled early, tightens via stone pulse/shudder to flash reversal under causal lens. Agency in final adjustment forecloses normalcy with cost ("trembling... no going back"). Escalation coherent but single turn lacks deepening trade-off for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of defying fate emerges via clock rebellion and visions, reweighted in final "possibilities and dangers" without moralizing. Subtext in shifting symbols/stone glow contrasts triumph with unease. Resonant CR in reverse shadows; ambiguity lingers plausibly but lacks motif recharge for 9.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (symbols "shift when stared at," gears as rebellion). Prose texture via rhythmic clauses matches inventive mind; no dialogue. Diction modulates to compression in flash ("waves that seemed to ripple through time"); perceptual signature consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in action-integrated details, varied rhythm accelerates to climax flash. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("ribs of some ancient beast," "broken tooth") during setup dulls early propulsion; "bleak exhilaration" reprises twice without loop penalty as it charges tone. Clean syntax, no major artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yoyo reverse-engineering hunger stone bends time premise organically via clock-maker logic. Tropes (mysterious relic) transformed by counter-clockwise defiance; risk in island "resisting" heightens unease payoff. Non-obvious yoyo-stone match feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
