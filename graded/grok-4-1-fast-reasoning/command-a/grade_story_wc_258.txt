<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's steadily curious trait drives consistent micro-choices like using the tape to quantify manipulation, embodied in her finger-brushing the tape amid Mira's story; Mira applies relevant pressure as foil. Minor weakness: interiority leans toward summary ("her mind already multiplying paths") without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via card shuffles and data density building to CR closure in dawn mural image reweighting collapse as blueprint with measured financial cost legible ("each inch representing a million dollars lost"). Single scene fits defaults; Mira's knock incites without orientation debt. Escalation tightens meaningfully once through collaboration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rain, skylight loft, and tape constrain choices tactilely—rain as rhythmic reminder, tape quantifies scale altering tactics in analysis beat. Sensory details selective via Elara's priorities (glinting tape, pulsing ink); evolves causally with data spread. Final mural integrates setting into charged image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping manipulation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via data-card weave narrowing to control revelation; agency in Elara's reverse engineering forecloses ignorance with felt cost in quantified losses. No major reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at mural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of patterns reversed emerges organically from Tower motif shifting from warning to blueprint, charged in "from its ruins, something new could rise"; subtext in tape-data fusion avoids statement. Final image reconfigures premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (ink patterns, tape glint); voice modulates poetically yet controlled. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("I need to confide"), distinct (Mira trembling, Elara faint smile). No head-hopping; diction fits cartomancer lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sentences advance via integrated image-action ("fingers brushed the measuring tape"). Minor overwrite in repeated "onyx-ink" and "swirling" metaphors, but no loops or muddle touching closure; propels to dawn cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy with blockchain forensics via tape quantification transforms crypto crash trope into cultural mapping; risk in symbolic cards pulsing alive heightens stakes organically. Turn to hope from Tower feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
