<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve songs roots choices like pigeon messages and dust mapping; interiority concrete in meteorite handling, but final self-preservation epiphany lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for full earn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: letter breaks dust chaos pattern, tightening to deliberate mapping; closure as Charged Poise CR in final image reconfigures options with conceptual cost of trust via "symphony of blooming and withering."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dust motes under skylight constrain mapping choice and charge final swirl image; attic tactile via musty air, coos, books integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of song preservation signaled early, deepens accumulatively via dust-map realization narrowing reinvention to truth; cost legible in "withered parts reviving" charging ending poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dust from chaos to map reweights paper trails of lies to truth thematically; final meteorite/dust image offers non-literal resonance on preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias to swirls/melodies stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from fragmented to clear song cadence under realization pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density weaves motif recurrence without loops dulling propulsion; minor "balance" paraphrase across paragraphs motif-driven, not templated; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dust-as-song-map synthesizes pigeons/meteorite into fresh textural arc; lyric accumulation risks pay off in inevitable CR without gimmick.</comment>
