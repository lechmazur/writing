<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus's observant trait and ghost-seeing gift root choices like dust analysis and ceiling climb, earning the closure lift of his "weightless burden." Embodied emotions (chill, pounding heart, warmth) show contradiction between curse/calling. Minor tell in "His motivation was clear" weakens pivotal drive without embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers/dust/cracks density tightens to clock insertion (RR closure), reconfiguring facade with felt peace/cost hint ("cracks always reappeared"). Orientation anchored early (Marcus enters ticket office). One deepening via barrel fit suffices; no slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory selection (sawdust scent, dust touch, whispers) filters through tech's bias, constraining climb via counter/tiles. Recurring cracks/barrel charge final healing image. Atmosphere pulses with ghosts' materialization, mirroring internal pull without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover ceilings' secrets) signaled via whispers/pull, deepens accumulatively to agency in insertion foreclosing unrest. Cost legible in trembling hands and future cracks hint. Pressure coheres without reversal need; ghosts complicate via pointing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden fractures healing emerges via literal cracks sealing post-clock, reweighting "facade" without moralizing. Final clock image/CR resonates with burden lift, inviting ambiguity on recurrence. Particulars (ghost girl, barrel) drive without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tech perceptual signature (dust like elevator faults). Rhythmic prose modulates tension (short clicks echo at climax). No dialogue; minor filter in "he felt a pull" but voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory; rhythm varies (short groan at tile loose). Minor paraphrase loop in cracks motif purposeful under textural lens. No artifacts dull closure's click/relief.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tech's observation meets ghost-clock fix in circus, transforming tropes via barrel-ceiling logic. Risky supernatural healing feels inevitable from dust/pull buildup.</comment>
