<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to resurrect stories is concrete, rooted in her diligent traits, and compels the final resolve to piece together lyrics; interiority particular via quill pauses and frantic transcription. Embodied excitement in heart quickening and skin warmth under pressure. Final endurance of mystery's gift feels earned without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from radio hum to spreading glow and vibrating air, culminating in Charged Poise closure where room reconfigures as "threshold" with cost of gnawed questions pushed aside ("the questions gnawed at her, but she pushed them aside"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ember alcove details (parchment scent, damp wood, mist veil) selectively sensory and constrain choices via radio proximity; recurring radio glow charges final image as silent watcher. POV bias in noticing glow's spread mirrors internal shift; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect stories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via song emergence and glow spread narrowing transcription focus; agency in frantic note-taking forecloses symphony work with felt excitement cost. Subtle but coherent pressure to final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of story resurrection emerges organically from broadcast fragment and dust-telling resolve, resonant in final image of forgotten quill without moralizing. Ambiguity in "how? And by whom?" lingers productively; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing ("mist clung like a veil"); rhythmic texture modulates from methodical calm to vibrating intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; voice coherent and biased toward mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "cloak itself in mystery") taught early without muddle in peak transcription beat; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase in glow descriptions but no loops obscuring closure; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of story famine world with pirate lyrics as narrative spark transforms tropes into inevitable "threshold" reconfiguration; risk in lyric poise heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
