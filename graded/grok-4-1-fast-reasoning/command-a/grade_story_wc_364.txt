<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eli's meekness and determination drive key choices like accepting the barter despite fear, with hesitation showing contradiction before resolve steels him. Interiority concrete in "mind raced" and embodied fear, but lacks deeper flawed impulses acting simultaneously. Final change earned via prior causality, though slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: stranger's offer therefore quest; weaving silk causes planet's healing DC and Eli's RR (changed self). Orientation anchored early in forge/orchard. Closure costs legible in "both more and less himself—caught between understanding and confusion," with tightening via treacherous descent narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches constrain path and evolve from "menacing" shadows to "humming with life," charging final image. Sensory blend of fruit/molten metal purposeful, filtered through Eli's forge bias. Micro-setting (mines crumbling) guides deliberate steps; vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (planet renewal via silk) signaled early, tightens via unstable shafts risking death, forcing endurance agency. Barter cost (awakening) felt on-page at climax weaving and end realization. Coherent causal pressure culminates in trade-off without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience/duality emerges from barter to changed self, final arches/vines reweighting meek-to-miracle arc non-literally. Azure motif shifts from stranger's eyes to sunset, charging closure without moralizing. Subtext in elusive awakening invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Eli's perceptual bias (cautious steps, glowing silk guidance). Voice texture consistent in rhythmic, forge-honed precision; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Your awakening"). No head-hopping, diction matches simple blacksmith.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short descent sentences building tension, but overwriting in "shimmering like liquid light" and repetitive "quiet but unyielding/deliberate" dull peak weave beat. Density high, no major loops, but minor purple strains coherence. Propulsion clear to azure-glow climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard planet/arches with silk-core weaving transforms standard quest via bartered self-change. Risk in abstract awakening payoff heightens stakes organically. No template echoes; particular defiance tone feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
