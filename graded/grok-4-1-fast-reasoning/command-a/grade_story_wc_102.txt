<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied sensations like trembling hands and warmth seeping into skin; motivation clear and intensifies through past-life flood tying to present choices. Final change earned as memories integrate without tidy epiphany. Minor label-speak ("spiritually curious") lacks embodied tradeoff, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (breath, spark, glow) links to RR closure where pendant placement reconfigures past weight into internal wellspring with felt cost ("reminder of the love she had once withheld"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via spark-to-alcove suffices. No slips; constraint (pendant path) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (wisteria scent to damp stone, blossoms humming) filtered through artist's gaze; viaduct constrains via sparks/compartment guiding to alcove, charging final image of glowing blossoms. Mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (pendant hollow) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via pendant memories narrowing to self-healing; agency in kneeling/following/placing forecloses haunted past with on-page cost (emotional integration). One tightening legible; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. Minor abstractness in stake phrasing pre-pendant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stored love as internal wellspring emerges organically from dream-spark-pendant arc, reweighting premise in final image ("wellspring waiting to be shared") without moralizing. Subtext in unkept promise payoff lingers plausibly. Resonant non-literal answer ties to Kwan Yin compassion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (ethereal beauty, hazy dream fragments); lyrical diction ("sky bled into hues") modulates fog to clarity, fitting tone. Rhythmic control heightens revelation without elision issues. Voice particular to spiritual artist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; rhythm breathes with escalation (short sentences at spark discovery). Minor paraphrase in "hands trembled" echoes, but spaced/non-closure. No loops, muddled metaphors, or artifacts dulling alcove climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist-pilgrim quest on wisteria viaduct transforms spiritual trope via jade tear mechanics and spark guidance. Risk in accumulative lyricism heightens closure resonance without gimmickry. Non-obvious pilgrim angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
