<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist trait labeled but shown in continued ascent despite loss; motivation clear and rooted in dice relics, compelling the final endurance. Internal conflict emerges in die slip reaction but leans summary over simultaneous impulses. Epiphany at "the rupture had occurred...within her" feels earned yet borders tidy rationalization without deeper embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via staircase imagery and proofs, pattern breaks at chipped die slip ("tumbling down the steps"), tightening to CR closure in realization of letting go with emotional cost of impermanence. Orientation anchored early in staircase/dice setup. Single shard fits scope; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains choice (can't retrieve die) and charges final image of boundless ascent; vivid sensory details like "boots scuffed," "clatter echoing," "walls pulsed" mirror internal chaos selectively through Elara's priorities. Atmosphere tensions philosophical quest without overt symbolism. Spatial coherence in shifting geometry tests resolve effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing missed opportunity's texture via perpetual motion) signaled early, escalates texturally with die loss narrowing options to single roll and realization; agency in rolling remaining die forecloses retrieval path with felt loss. Cost legible in "heart pounding" and lighter dice weight. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of perpetual motion as embracing impermanence emerges organically from dice loss and proofs, reweighting regrets in final image without moralizing; resonance in "weave into the fabric of her perpetual motion" offers non-literal answer to central question. Subtext in duality of dice avoids platitudes. Minor pseudo-profundity in "philosophical ideal" but earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in math-tinged noticing ("unproven theorems"); rhythmic prose modulates from steady breath to pounding heart under stress. Poetic diction purposeful and consistent, no head-hopping or withholding. Voice distinct without dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy sentences at die slip ("Elara froze, her heart pounding"); high density in integrated setting/action. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("ruptured the boundaries," "labyrinth of choices") dulls one peak beat slightly; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh sideways infinite staircase conceit transforms perpetual motion trope through dice duality and math relics; risk in surreal geometry heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early metaphors, no derivative echoes.</comment>
