<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to act on compassion is consistent and intensifies through letter exchanges to the meeting risk. Interiority feels concrete in locket sensations (heavier to lighter), earning the final change. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses under pressure; idealized without strong flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from envelope find to letters to meeting realization. Closure as Charged Poise in "locket photo... lighter now, as if its purpose had been fulfilled" with felt emotional cost. Multiple shards fit Mosaic Track with legible transitions; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "breeze carried the scent of salt and pine" filter through Elara's seaside bias, guiding library choice. Breezy library under stars charges final image, mirroring internal release. Spatial choreography clear across shards; selective economy fits length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to kindle connection signaled early via envelope compulsion; accumulative tightening in inviting Clara despite "risk." Agency in drafting/enclosing photo forecloses isolation with relational cost felt at parting. Low visceral pressure; stakes lean abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges organically from envelope detour to grandmother reveal, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like locket reprise; ambiguity in "just the beginning" invites reflection. Protagonist arc inextricable from theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in noticing overlooked (elderly man, silent contributors). Voice modulates warmly across shards; minimal dialogue natural ("Is everything alright?"). Rhythmic control supports reflective tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in integrated sensory/action lines; rhythm varies with scene needs. Minor paraphrase loops like repeated "cycles of compassion" dull momentum slightly. No artifacts in closure; clean propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh inflection: mistaken envelope links cargo broker's noticing to librarian's stories, transforming kindness trope via locket grandmother tie. Organic synthesis; avoids templates but hedges in idealized resolution.</comment>
