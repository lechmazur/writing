<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to capture a spark intensifies through her precise work on the traveler, culminating in an earned shift to embracing stillness with trembling hands and softened gaze. Contradictory impulses act in her pause before pressing the chip and kneeling to learn. Interiority concrete via embodied reactions like pounding heart, though occasionally poetic over particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build to chip's infusion reviving traveler, whose words trigger CR closure ("realized... true motivation... understand the stillness"). Cost legible in foreclosed spark-chasing path, charged final image of steady chip and stepping forward. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora and crystalline grotto recur to mirror internal states, constraining via sanctuary pull and final gateway shift; charges closure glow. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (eyes scanning walls, chip's cool surface). Micro-setting (emerald chip as tool/object) enables pivotal infusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early, deepens via traveler's words ("sparks are fleeting... stillness endures") forcing stance reconfiguration under Accumulative lens. Agency in infusion and kneeling forecloses prior path with felt fear-cost. One tightening sufficient, pressure coheres to CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness over fleeting sparks emerges via chip's glow/fade, traveler's words, final realization reweighting premise without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in "patterns... in the quiet of her own heart," lingering ambiguity on oblivion. Organic from conflict, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (lucid scanning, pattern-seeking bias). Poetic diction/rhythm modulates intensity, distinct from brief traveler dialogue carrying ancient/new subtext. No head-hopping; voice texture purposeful for fantasy hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in infusion, lengthening in silence); high density integrates sensory/action. Minor repetition ("patterns," "stillness") purposeful under lens, no loops or muddled metaphors touching closure. Propulsion clear, no scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Beautician mortician premise ingeniously synthesizes beauty/death with emerald chip revival, transforming tropes via grotto's hush-to-gateway arc. Fresh CR on stillness feels inevitable from particulars; bold fantasy risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
