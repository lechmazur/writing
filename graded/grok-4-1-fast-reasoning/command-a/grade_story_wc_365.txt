<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shift to guardian role lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, with realization told via orb projection rather than earned micro-choices; interiority concrete but epiphanic summary weakens pivotal close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to Conceptual Repricing in orb image with "weight settled" cost; shard pulls provide causal shards, orientation anchors early in repair bay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory maps like "rust and old grease" to "scent of blooming flora" filter through Elara's bias, constraining forest navigation and charging orb as nexus hub in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake from personal truth deepens accumulatively to multiversal duty via woman's warning and shard merge, foreclosing prior life with shoulder weight cost; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of maps as fragile lifelines emerges organically via weaving actions and orb projection reweighting premise without moral; resonant counter-reading in "heavier than you imagine."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sensory-perceptual signature like "weave the sounds...into a mental map"; brief dialogue natural, goal-driven exposition advances to merge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates action-image; minor "felt" repetition but no loops dull closure orb beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory map maker guarding multiverse weaves transforms portal trope via shard-orbs and cyclic anomalies into fresh conceptual charge.</comment>
