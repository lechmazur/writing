<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (breath catching, warmth like shawl) and earned change via apology pulse root motivation in grandmother's loss; mild deduction for subtle rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hum/scent to resonant reconfiguration (archive glows, bottle lightens) and legible emotional cost in imperfect forgiveness; on-page closure with before/after (tangled threads to lighter heart).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perfume bottle as micro-setting constrains channeling choice and charges final image (placed back fulfilled); vivid sensory integration (aged paper smell, rustle) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology via bottle) signaled early with accumulative deepening (currents personal, vision fragments to pulse); one tightening forecloses regret path with felt relational cost, charging orchard sigh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles theme emerges organically from bottle cracks/vision fragments to resonant end image (roots remain, current forever) without statement; reweights prior material non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (metaphors as currents/smoke); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (scent blooming, pulse flows) in peak beats; minor deduction for hum/whisper paraphrase echoes mid-build, but rhythm varies and propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcism via currents/perfume transforms haunting trope through personal orchard loss; risk in lyric accumulation heightens ethereal grit without gimmick.</comment>
