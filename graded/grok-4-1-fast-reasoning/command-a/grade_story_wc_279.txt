<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via unease, but traits like "socially perceptive nature" and "whimsical spirit" remain diagnostic labels without full contradictory impulses in pivotal mandala shift; final endurance earned but tidy without deeper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from flake interjection to mandala dissolution; CR closure lands on-page as unease reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost in "lilac unease remained... a guide"; orientation anchored early in grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist, damp stone, and tile flake vividly constrain choices, charging final fade; sensory hush and sand curls mirror internal states purposefully without catalog; micro-setting (mandala/flake) shapes inciting incident and closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in chaos) tightens accumulatively via hush growth and hand emergence, narrowing to purposeful whisper; agency in interjections forecloses tidy discovery for created meaning, cost felt in deepened unease.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of honoring silence emerges organically from grotto's story and mandala response; final image reweights premise non-literally as Elara carries hush outward; ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in energy attunement; voice texture poetic and consistent, modulating rhythm with hush intensification; no dialogue, elision purposeful in abstract patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("mist clung like a reluctant lover") and "lilac unease" repetition dull propulsion slightly; no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mandala ritual and silenced history transforms discovery trope; tile flake/unlearning angle non-obvious, risks lyric abstraction payoff in CR; organic to voice without hedging.</comment>
