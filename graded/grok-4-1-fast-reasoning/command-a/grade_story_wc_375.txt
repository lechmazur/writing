<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between mechanical repetition and suppressed passion shown in trembling hand and mnemonic chains; final painting choice earned via discoveries. Minor therapy-speak in "auroral sorrow" epiphany slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories and symbols builds to pattern break (forgotten painting/note) and RR closure in self-portrait completion with legible cost (shattered chains symbolized by lock). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal cave vividly filters through artist's priorities (shimmers as cage/womb); recurring crystals constrain discovery (alcove) and charge final prismatic dance mirroring rebirth. Sensory selective (drips, cool touch) without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creativity vs fear) signaled early; Accum lens escalation via deepening discoveries narrowing to painting decision, with agency in strokes and felt cost in years' rectification. One tightening sufficient, charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-revelation emerges organically from lock/painting symbols shifting meaning; refrain reweights premise in final womb image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal close ties arc to question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with artistic perceptual signature (strokes/shadows); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity to charged poise. No dialogue or slips; elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; minor paraphrase loop in finger-stain/lock reflections and refrain reuse dulls slightly mid-beat. No artifacts at closure; rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic artist in crystal cave transforms suppression trope via symbol evolution; bold internal risk heightens rebirth stakes organically.</comment>
