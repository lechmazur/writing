<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's spatially gifted trait and protective motivation drive navigation and hesitation effectively, with micro-choices like loosening grip on laser pointer revealing internal shift under intruder pressure. Interiority concrete in mapping farm but edges into abstract epiphany at "physics of letting go" realization. Father backstory anchors reflection without flattening stakes, tilting her final acceptance with felt cost in worldview expansion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup from disturbance to footprints to figure accumulates to CR closure in mushroom acceptance, reweighting protection as connection with conceptual cost of abandoning old role. Single scene oriented early ("bioluminescent mushroom farm," her role); no disorientation debt. Pivotal trail-following and dialogue tighten options legibly toward Charged Poise in clearing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow selectively mirrors internal shift, constraining navigation ("maze-like rows") and charging final image where farm "seemed to shift... brighter, warmer." Sensory hierarchy (visual hum, damp soil, air ripple) reflects professional urgency without catalog. Mushrooms as micro-setting evolve causally, guiding intruder pursuit and epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (detect intrusion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via non-human footprints and figure's familiarity, forcing stance shift from confrontation to acceptance. Agency in questioning and taking mushroom forecloses protective isolation with felt cost in "new role." One tightening suffices: ripple to clearing crystallizes options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges organically from footprints ("ripple... through permeable barriers"), dialogue implications, and mushroom image reweighting protection as expansion. Subtext in figure's familiarity invites ambiguity without moralizing excess. Final whisper "familiar strangers... bridges" resonates non-literally but borders explicit thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (spatial mapping, glow urgency); diction selective ("ethereal light," "quiet wildfire"). Dialogue subtextual ("boundaries... bridges") advances goal, distinct from narration. Rhythmic modulation under stress clean, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in pursuit); high density in glow integrations advances atmosphere/action. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("quiet wildfire," "scalpel") at non-peak but no loop/synonym churn touching closure. Propulsion clear, no scaffold in pivotal clearing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion specialist in bioluminescent farm confronts philosophical intruder, transforming security trope into perceptual revolution via mushroom bridge. Risk in quiet, image-driven CR pays off without gimmick; "familiar strangers" inflects organically from face glimpse.</comment>
