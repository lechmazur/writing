<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve memories is consistent and ties to closure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during rope-weaving; regrets are summarized pre-process rather than complicating micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (melody awakening names, her own included) with felt cost of thawed regrets; orientation anchored early in sanctum; one tightening via time-compressed labor suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora pulses in sync with movements and flares at closure, constraining and charging final image; glacial walls and pine-frost scent filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate memory) signaled early with accumulative deepening via labor escalation narrowing to success; internal regret pressure coheres but external opposition absent, keeping agency endurance mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory as bridge emerges organically from card-to-melody arc; final realization reweights preservation as connection with lingering ambiguity on loss, non-literal via singing names.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (echoes/memories in objects); rhythm modulates from tender precision to humming potential, fitting wax-caster idiom without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative density ("frozen cathedral," "snowmelt ardor") pervades labor montage without variation, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops in praise of rope/secrets trigger scaffold deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax-casting relic with organ card and mythic rope transforms memory trope into audacious craft; risk of solo lyric fantasy pays off in charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
