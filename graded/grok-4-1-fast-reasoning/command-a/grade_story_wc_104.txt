<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liberator's traits like purpose and sharpness feel told via stock phrasing ("eyes burned with purpose," "mind...honed") rather than shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict or blind spots complicate the arc, yielding a competent but archetypal hero.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links (decode arrow → vault access → escape via paths); orientation anchored early; closure DC via escape and chains shed, but magical "chains fell away, as if...never been there" lacks causal buildup, softening cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (rusted creaks, dust, earth scent) integrate via action; carnival's labyrinth constrains escape choice and charges final "launching point for hope" image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeds before wall) signaled early, tightens causally via decode/chase/escalation; agency in wits and paths forecloses direct fight with felt chain/time costs, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from decay-to-hope arc, seeds/chains motifs shifting via escape; final image plants defiance with non-literal resonance reweighting premise, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with consistent poetic texture ("staggering grace," "macabre rhythm"); perceptual bias via strategic focus under stress; no dialogue, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density advance beats, but repetitive chain motifs ("rattled," "dragging," "clinking") create minor paraphrase loops across three beats, dulling propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival decay, seed vault, chained hero transforms tropes via puzzle/chase; final chains-shed inflects resilience organically, risking symbolic convenience but earning hindsight inevitability.</comment>
