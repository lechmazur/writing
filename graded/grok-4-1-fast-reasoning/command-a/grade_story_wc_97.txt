<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via piano, clock, and film memories, but leans on labels like "steely longing"; final endurance earned as she plays new melody embracing fate instead of forcing encore.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with motif density (compasses, clock, film) tightening to CR closure where clock ticks and compasses still, reweighting premise with embrace-cost legible in "surprised fate... with a new song altogether."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring objects (compasses in trunk, reel pedestal) constrain choices like following erratic needles to chamber; final arbor sigh charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to surprise fate signaled early via plan; film entry deepens via memory shards, forcing renunciation of encore for embrace with agency and cost in shifted melody.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of embracing fluid time emerges organically from film memories to clock reprise; resonant non-literal answer in new song reweights prior longing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in musical bias (melody stirs soul, fingers moving with purpose); rhythmic modulation suits wistful-to-charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density weaves setting into action without loops; minor purple in "ethereal breeze" but rhythm varies, propelling to clear closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arbor/film-reel portal transforms memory tropes; risk in fluid-time world heightens stakes via irreplaceable reel mechanics.</comment>
