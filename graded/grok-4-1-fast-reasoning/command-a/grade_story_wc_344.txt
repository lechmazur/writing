<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to learn the rhythm of repair drives consistent micro-choices like deciphering prophecies and entering the hall, culminating in an earned reconfiguration in the vortex visions. Interiority feels concrete and embodied (trembling hands uncapping vial). Minor weakness: lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward smooth progression without deep internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prophecies accumulate to symbols pointing to door, density peaks in hall's shifting mirrors and visions for on-page RR (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the distorting vortex she navigates. Orientation anchored early (frozen library, Elara's role). Single continuous scene with seamless transition; closure reconfigures purpose with legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (scent of parchment, frosted windows' glow, colder air in hall) filter through Elara's locksmith lens, constraining choices like cautious approach to pedestal. Mirrors as micro-setting charge final image, mirroring internal states via visions. Environment evolves causally (door revealed, mirrors shift), mirroring stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (acquire gears for rhythm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via prophecy pattern to hall tightening (mirrors distort, pulling into vortex), forcing endurance/renunciation with agency in stepping back. Cost felt in heart-pounding approach and vortex pull foreclosing naive quest. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected repair emerges organically from gears/mirrors/prophecies, reweighted in final image of confident piecing with ticking clock acknowledging progress. Subtext in visions (child/older selves) invites ambiguity on time's fabric without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to quest in harmony found, tied to character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (locksmith noting gears/spines); diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled, modulating from hushed exploration to sharper chill in hall. Voice texture distinct (lyric drift to confident close). No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in hall tension); density high, sentences multi-task. Minor artifacts: "hauntingly bright" and "distant morning" loops (−0.4), some overwriting in descriptive peaks like "words shifting like shadows." Propulsion clear, no scaffold obscuring closure; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar-eclipse locksmith questing time-mending gears in cloud library transforms fantasy tropes via specific visions and repair rhythm. Bold risk in hall's infinite reflections heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise commits to implications without hedging.</comment>
