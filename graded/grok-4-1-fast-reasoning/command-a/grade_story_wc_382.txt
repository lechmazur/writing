<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara's cautious curiosity and shame-driven resolve earn her final knock, with contradictory impulses in tightening the seal versus leaning in; Elias applies pressure through probing the seal, revealing character flaws without hedging. Minor slip: Elias's mystic archetype borders stock, but micro-choices like gesturing to sky sustain distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations density-build to CR closure in Clara knocking with sugar, reweighting isolation via felt shame and resolve; morning shard transitions legibly as direct payoff. Orientation anchored early in garden/meteor; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rooftop garden's railing, herbs, and meteor light constrain edge-sitting and glinting eyes, charging Elias's silhouette blend; sensory mix (scents, hum, creaks) filters through Clara's architectural bias. Final sugar pouch evokes garden patience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn hidden languages) signaled early, tightens via seal reveal and sugar handoff narrowing to neighbor action; agency in interrogation and knock forecloses isolation with shame cost. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths in stone/wood emerges via building tongues and lies, reweighted in tea-start without moralizing; sugar motif shifts from confusion to key, resonating isolation's conceptual cost non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable Clara-limited POV with perceptual bias (architecture hums); dialogue subtextual (Elias's "borrowing sugar" evades directness, pursues revelation). Rhythm modulates from relaxed to probing, distinct idioms (Elias enigmatic, Clara direct).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in revelation beats, varied rhythm; minor overwriting in "rooftops whispered secrets to the stars" opening but purposeful for tone, no loops or artifacts dulling closure knock image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic tutor teaching building languages via sugar-tea transforms isolation trope; sugar-borrow method's quirky logic commits to premise, inevitable hindsight payoff in knock.</comment>
