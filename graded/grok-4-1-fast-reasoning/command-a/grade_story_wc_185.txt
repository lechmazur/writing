<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving actions like crack examination to path conjuring; embodied emotions (heart steady, body weary) ground her resolve. Weakness: minimal internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure, with success feeling competent but untested by flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cave hum to chorus of stillness, causal linkages (cracks→path→seed activation) tighten to on-page RR closure (bloom unfurls, storm silenced) with felt cost (Lira's weariness). Orientation anchored early ("harmonic caves...aftermath of the energy beings"); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (humming walls, ice cracks glowing) integrated into action, with recurring ice/crystal constraining choices (fractures map path) and caves responding to conjure, charging final chorus. Micro-setting (echo stone, pedestal) guides pivotal climax; tone tensions anticipation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore hush vs. storm chaos) signaled early, textural escalation via deepening hum/heavier air narrows to conjuring trade-off; agency in song-creation forecloses chaos with visible cost (weariness post-unfurling). One tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of quiet-in-storm emerges organically from particulars (cracks→lullaby silence), final bloom image reconfiguring chaos-to-repose without moralizing; subtext in caves' grateful whisper adds resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (harmony/ripples bias noticing cracks, hums); poetic diction/rhythm modulates from anticipation to repose, fitting fantasy texture without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong density and propulsion in action lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("gently luminous glow" recurs thrice without payoff) and repetitive stems ("the air...the caves") dull peak beats slightly; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh fantasy synthesis (ice-crack maps, hush-bloom silencing energy storm) transforms quest trope via ripplekeeper ingenuity; risk in textural conjure-song feels organic, inevitable at bloom flare.</comment>
