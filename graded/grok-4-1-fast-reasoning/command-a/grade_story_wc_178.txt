<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Label-speak dominates interiority ("empirically ironic nature made him both a skeptic and a seeker"), flattening contradictions into summary rather than scene actions; final shift feels told, not earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("ready to seal the covenant"), cost legible in skepticism-to-devotion reweighting; lacks one meaningful tightening as tile discovery brushes conveniently without reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through astronomer's priorities (courtyard schematic, observatory dome constrain alignment); purposeful details like "towering ziggurats" and star alignment charge final image without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled but pressure static—no reversal narrows options, alignment deepens abstractly without agency cost; climax realization lacks felt trade-off under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of devotion-as-key emerges organically from tile deciphering to covenant renewal; final image ("with the tile in hand") offers non-literal resonance reweighting skepticism without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (star alignments, cosmic patterns); rhythmic texture modulates effectively, diction controlled and biased toward astronomical idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "frugal nature," "schematic representations," and "dusky harmony" dull density (−0.6); strong propulsion overall, varied rhythm, no muddled metaphors touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as cosmic cipher in Babylonian palace transforms discovery trope; tile's pattern emergence feels inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
