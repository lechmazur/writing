<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract epiphanies like "jolt of clarity shot through her" without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; final change feels told rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with crystal study building to CR closure in final geode moment ("she understood: the hunt... embracing the process"); cost legible in reshaping amid "broken" world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory and crystals constrain choices (touch awakens, fractures mirror mind) and charge final image; sensory details like "hum" and "shimmering" selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (hunt potential) signaled early accumulates density to discovery tightening; agency in studying forces realization with felt cost of ongoing journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from crystal parallels without overt moralizing; final talisman image offers non-literal resonance reweighting trauma to purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (physics-filtered noticing of geometries/fractures); rhythmic lyric texture modulates effectively, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "hunt" and crystal metaphors ("mirror to chaos," "repository of potential") create minor redundancy; overwriting in descriptive beats dulls some propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone trauma, sci-fi observatory, and perturbation theory transforms tropes into specific seeker arc; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes.</comment>
