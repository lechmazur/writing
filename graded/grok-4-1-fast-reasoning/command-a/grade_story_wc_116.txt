<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to witness without judgment drives journey against caution, embodied in gripping swan tighter; change earned via mirror visions with contradictory duty-intrigue impulses. Minor abstract epiphany phrasing in final journals slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to mirror visions' CR closure, reweighting preservation stake with unraveling cost legible in "mind unravel, visions flashed... peace." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via swan-map suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (damp earth scent, heartbeat echo) filter through Lira's loose grip, constraining path via shifting walls; swan recurs as micro-setting charging final folded reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fragile balance signaled early, deepens accumulatively to visions foreclosing denial; agency in following map tightens with unraveling cost felt on-page, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impermanence theme emerges organically via swan-map to refuge cycle, final image of infused journals and erased refuge offering non-literal CR answer reweighting change-without-judgment premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature ("grips reality loosely, perceptions shaped by stories"); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity to charged poise at mirror gaze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration (vines embracing tomes); purposeful lyric repetition of silence/peace taught early avoids loops, minor abstract tell in final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami map triggering surreal refuge vision transforms self-discovery trope; risk-taking in Accumulative CR closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
