<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with machinist-gears mind and trembling hands revealing doubt/hope contradiction under pressure; final resolve earned via chain poem realization. Minor limit: solo POV skips relationship crucible, but micro-choices like pacing and sketching align motives tightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (adhesive code, chain poem) build density to Charged Poise closure in dust-sketch moment with legible cost ("trembled, but not broken"); orientation anchored early in amphitheater. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amphitheater's breathing walls and glowing cracks constrain pacing/center reach and mirror heartbeat escalation, charging final less-forboding image; sensory hierarchy (damp stone, heat) POV-specific via machinist eye. Micro-setting chain integrates as tactile guide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (village fear vs scholar curiosity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chain poem to compromise sketch narrowing options; tremble-to-steady agency shows felt cost. Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility in "risk everything."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unity/sacrifice emerges organically from poem ("give is to gain") and design harmonizing fear/curiosity, resonant in volcano-as-unity image without moralizing; subtext in encrypted compassion avoids platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (gears-like thoughts, selective crack-tracing); rhythmic prose modulates tension via breath-sync sentences, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chain glinting reveals inscriptions); varied rhythm avoids loops, but figurative density ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled") borders overwrite in peak discovery without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machinist puzzle in poetic chain transforms volcano trope via compromise calculus; risk in breathing-amphitheater personification heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from adhesive-to-design arc.</comment>
