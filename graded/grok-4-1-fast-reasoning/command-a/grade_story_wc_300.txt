<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation shifts from inspection to purpose via pearl's pull, but epiphany at "Elara’s motivation crystallized" feels unearned and diagnostic, lacking contradictory impulses in scene; final resolve shows endurance without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from pearl discovery to chamber visions; on-page RR closure in crown activation and final image of "steady resolve" lands Charged Poise with felt promise/cost; orientation anchored early in caves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Crystal caves vividly constrain path and charge final "walls...whisper back" image, with sensory hum/echoes mirroring internal state through goal-directed exploration; selective quartz veins guide choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of curiosity vs. tight timeframe tightens via pearl's pull to crown, forcing trade-off in hesitation; one deepening at visions forecloses isolation with legible emotional cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of unity emerges organically from confessions/whispers dissolving "walls between hearts," reweighted in final beacon image without moralizing; counter-reading of abandonment lingers via chorus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward radiance/whispers; voice texture modulates poetically under building intensity, perceptual signature in "hum with stories untold"; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing like "resonant hush" (title echo to end) and "latent radiance" creates paraphrase loops dulling propulsion; figurative density in peak chamber beat (e.g., "erupted in light") borders overwriting without pattern payoff; rhythm varies but scaffold in stacked descriptors slows closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker inspection with mythic pearl/crown transforms isolation tropes via etched confessions; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via cave logic.</comment>
