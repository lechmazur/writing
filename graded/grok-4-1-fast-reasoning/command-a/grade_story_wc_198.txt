<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and consistent, compelling the central choice of playing; embodied effort in "chest rising and falling" shows cost. Lacks concrete interior contradiction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase (moss brightens, mist shimmers, atrium rotates) tightening to prophecy dissolution as RR closure; cost legible in saxophonist's heaving chest and lingering melody.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains choice by humming/rotating/pointing beam in response to music, charging final serene harmony image. Sensory details (pulsing moss, swirling mist) integrated purposefully through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates via density under lens (music envelops, prophecy softens); agency in deliberate playing forecloses doom with visible effort cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of music rewriting fate emerges organically from melody unraveling code; final moss flicker offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting sanctuary's balance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (musical whispers, misty patterns); rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully under stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in mist/grotto changes ("thicken... swirling," "shimmered... sacred") dull propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical music hushing coded prophecy transforms tropes through grounded sensory escalation; risk-taking in textural drive heightens eerie closure without gimmickry.</comment>
