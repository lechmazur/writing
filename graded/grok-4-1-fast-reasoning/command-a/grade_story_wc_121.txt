<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as fractal paths density revelations to center CR, tablet glow reconfiguring timelines with conceptual cost; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viaduct's slick edge and fractal evolution constrain steps and charge final whole-state image, sensory details (wet asphalt, hum) mirroring internal shimmer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Agency in pressing through dimming tablet drives accumulative deepening of self-stake, cost unmistakable in merged darkness/brightness yielding lighter resolve.</comment>
