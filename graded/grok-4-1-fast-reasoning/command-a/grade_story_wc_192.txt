<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied scar sacrifice and hollow ache earn closure choice with felt cost; abstract paradox motivation ("teach suffocating to breathe") slightly under-dramatized until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build to RR closure; scar severance line delivers legible cost, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Threshold cracks and starlight constrain ring action and charge final vigil image; selective sensory filter mirrors guardian priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tendrils snaking forces ring trade-off under accumulative lens; post-climax ache makes cost visceral, agency drives deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scar-ring interplay reconfigures transformation theme non-literally in ending vigil; paradox emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (scars glimmering, strength flowing) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn in "encroaching darkness" paraphrases dulls density slightly; propulsion strong, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scar-linking transforms guardian trope into fresh causal engine; paradox motivation risks bold synthesis inevitable at closure.</comment>
