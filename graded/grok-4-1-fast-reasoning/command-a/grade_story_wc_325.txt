<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely through ragged breath and closing walls, compelling micro-choices like prying the vault; internal conflict acts simultaneously in descent beats. Earned change in final calm after phase vision forecloses fear's control with felt cost. Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing at "she felt a strange calm," but prior causality holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via atmospheric density and holds to CR closure: phase transition reweights cables' meaning with conceptual cost of respecting unseen in final image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (facility, Elena's return). Single scene fits defaults; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Recurring "crashing hush" and tidal water constrain choices (rising water guides return) and charge final waves-as-promise image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to headlamp flickers, silt; POV bias filters via spelunker's priorities. Vault glass pedestal integrates tactilely into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (codex for mentor amid fear) signaled early; density deepens via phase haze, narrowing to stance crystallization on cables' danger. Agency in touching fleck forces trade-off; cost legible in endured transition and foreclosed control. Lens escalation via pattern break in vault groan moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of respecting unseen emerges organically from fleck vision and Voss echo, reweighting premise in final codex-clutch without moralizing. Returning hush motif shifts from threat to promise. Invites ambiguity on journey ahead via charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with claustrophobic perceptual signature (walls closing, shadows dancing). Voice texture modulates rhythm under stress (short sentences in vault pry). Voss dialogue sparse, subtextual ("not meant to control"), advances revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "walls seemed to close in" advances setting/emotion); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor artifact: "crashing hush" motif risks loop but pattern-taught early pays off at end. No filter stacks or paraphrase in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cables-as-veins with illuminant fleck enables phase ingenuity, transforming relic trope via undersea logic. Risky liminal realm turn grows from spelunker's motive, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
