<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's wistful traits and loom work are consistent but lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; journey decision feels told without embodied internal conflict. Epiphany at clearing reads unearned, with abstract realization over micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puzzle assembly deepens density toward RR closure as bridge forms and Elara steps on, reconfiguring silence with felt sacrifice cost in "weight of her sacrifice—the life she had left behind." One tightening via shifting puzzle scenes suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bamboo rustle and dappled light as "liquid gold" evolve to charge final clearing image, constraining path through orchard phenomena like singing trees. Sensory selection mirrors weaving motif purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of carrying message escalates accumulatively through puzzle-guided discoveries, narrowing to bridge stance crystallization; agency in placing final piece forecloses familiar life, but abstract distance keeps some stakes declarative over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-connection emerges organically from loom, puzzle shifts, and bridge image reweighting raveling into wholeness; final step offers resonant non-literal answer with sacrifice cost, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward weaving textures; rhythmic modulation supports Accumulative lens, diction controlled without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "bridge of light") patterns early but overwrites discovery beats, slightly dulling propulsion; minor motif loop in "raveling silence" risks redundancy without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jigsaw puzzle as living map transforms mythic journey trope into fresh, puzzle-driven quest; bead and silence synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
