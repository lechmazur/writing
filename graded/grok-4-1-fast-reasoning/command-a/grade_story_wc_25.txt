<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Eli's walk-identification trait enables pivotal Mira recognition and motivation shift; hesitation at key moment shows internal conflict. Ending endurance feels earned via curiosity buildup, but Mira remains underdeveloped beyond trope hints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via map/key progression to CR closure ("labyrinth was more than a maze... whispers held power"); cost legible in trembling collapse risk at unlocking. Orientation anchored early in port labyrinth; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shipping-container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm constrain paths and choices (groaning containers, pulsing energy); sensory details (salt/rust, clangs) filter through Eli's worker bias and charge final passage light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach center) signaled via map, escalates accumulatively through resistant shadows/map unfolding to wall reversal; agency in key-turn forecloses hesitation with storm-peak cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Whispers-over-shouts theme emerges from Mira encounter, map responses, and final CR image without statement; resonant reconfiguration lingers via quiet power amid chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (walk rhythms); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Prove it" pursues status). Voice modulates rhythmically with storm intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor overwriting in "shadows stretching unnaturally long" but no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of walk-identification gift, zodiac coin, and geomagnetic storm transforms maze trope; calculated-spontaneity unlock feels inevitable from subtle buildup.</comment>
