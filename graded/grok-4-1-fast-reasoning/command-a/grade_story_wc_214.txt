<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Spiritual curiosity roots motivation and drives key choices like following coordinates, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal empathy beat; change feels earned via prior buildup without deeper internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from lantern discovery to CR closure in dimming glow and internalized stillness; cost legible in "purpose fulfilled" as power transfers to Lira, reconfiguring her role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Station and lantern as micro-setting constrain path to observation deck and charge final image; sensory details like pulsing warmth and star patterns selectively heighten cosmic specificity without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of curiosity tightens accumulatively via self-activating trackers and merging light, forcing realization; cost felt in surrender of lantern's external guidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from star sacrifices and cleaning meditation; final shooting star image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting janitorial role without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with cosmic perceptual signature; voice modulates poetically yet consistently, perceptual bias toward mysteries biases noticing without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, but minor overwriting in opening descriptions like "skeletal frame etched against the infinite void" slightly dulls early propulsion; no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor premise transformed via lantern-key map into fresh paradox of stillness-strength; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
