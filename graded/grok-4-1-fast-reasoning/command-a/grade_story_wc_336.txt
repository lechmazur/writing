<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete yet leans on poetic abstractions like "color of wonder" without embodied contradiction under pressure. No genuine flaws complicate choices, reducing to archetype. Final endurance of purpose feels earned but untested by visible cost on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from preparation to ritual planting, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "the seed had sprouted, its tender shoot glowing faintly," reconfiguring orchard with conceptual preservation cost. Orientation anchored early in parapet/orchard. Single scene coherent, no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (waterfall rhythm as "lullaby," soil "richest"); parapet/waterfall subtly guides planting choice and mirrors hush. Final golden glow charges image without overt symbolism. Recurrent waterfall evolves with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder via seed) signaled early but remains abstract; accumulative deepening via ritual density narrows to success without narrowing live options or trade-off. No reversal tests commitment; cost felt conceptually in time but not viscerally on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preservation emerges organically from ritual and orchard revival; final image of "quiet triumph" offers non-literal resonance reweighting connections. Minor pseudo-profundity in "guardian of the unseen threads" but avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing "radiant hush," essence); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compression purposeful in ritual. No dialogue; free indirect clean and biased to Elara's wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in ritual); density high but minor paraphrase loops ("radiant hush," "essence") recur without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling propulsion. No major artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pruner-as-weaver with essence-capture ritual transforms planting trope; "heirloom seed as portal" inflects magically via particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
