<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is told early but never constrains a micro-choice with visible cost or contradiction, as in the solitary descent; Elara's traits feel labeled rather than driving embodied conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via box→riddle→key→descent→orb touch, landing CR closure in visions and reveal decision with conceptual cost of drones' sacrifice legible in "the drones had sacrificed themselves."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tower's "metallic frame etched with the faint hum" and hidden panel guide descent choice; final "tower hummed back to life" charges closure image without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering hive truth tightens causally through riddle interpretation and orb touch, with agency in descent foreclosing ignorance; cost felt in "trembling hands" and sacrifice revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved emerges organically from riddle-to-visions arc, resonating in final "map of the stars" image without moralizing; no tidy binary, ambiguity in routine truth lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias in "strange pull" from riddle; rhythmic modulation supports descent tension, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "gleaming with intricate patterns that seemed to shift" risks muddle but doesn't obscure; varied rhythm propels, no loops in closure but some paraphrase in early box description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lightning drones and truthful keeper transforms relic-tower trope; risk in orb visions pays off with star-map reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
