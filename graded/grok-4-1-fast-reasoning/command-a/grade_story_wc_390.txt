<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's logically emotional trait drives internal conflict effectively in the confrontation beat, with embodied reactions like trembling hands and warring impulses shown simultaneously rather than summarized. Final choice to channel the key feels earned via prior hesitation and visions. Minor slip in generic guardian devotion phrasing slightly limits exceptional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: vibration signals intruder → confrontation → visions → key revelation → repulsion as DC closure with felt cost in figure's scream and Elara's lingering battle awareness. Orientation anchored early in marina/lighthouse. One tightening at realization suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and lighthouse constrain choices (descend to meet intruder, ice cracks amplify vibration); sensory details like brine and shifting ice filter through Elara's urgency. Key as recurring object charges final image. Purposeful selectivity avoids catalog; mirrors internal harmony/discord subtly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect key signaled early, tightens causally at visions tempting misuse before key glow forecloses that path with agency-driven channeling. Cost legible in figure's retreat and Elara's resolve. Coherent pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony vs. discord emerges organically from vibrational conflict and key's power, with final image of fading glow reweighting protection over use as non-literal answer. Subtext in hesitation invites ambiguity without tidy moral. Particulars like visions deepen without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (engineer's focus on vibrations, key's warmth); voice texture poetic yet consistent, modulating rhythm in peak (short sentences at roar). Dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Prove it"), goal-driven. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion (short peaks at climax). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors (e.g., "dying embers") and one paraphrase loop on vibrations dull slightly without obscuring closure. No stacks or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sonic absolution in drift-ice marina transforms guardian trope via vibrational mechanics, with fresh figure reveal and key-channeling turn feeling inevitable from setup. Bold ethereal synthesis heightens stakes organically.</comment>
