<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reconcile the swallowed truth intensifies through embodied conflict (pang at smudge) and micro-choices (tracing, admitting), earning her final endurance with felt cost in perpetual margins. Internal contradictions act simultaneously in scene (holding truths yet questioning as lie). Wanderer forces relational pressure, revealing character limits without tidy resolution. Minor abstractness in trait labels slightly tempers peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of swaying/smudging images builds to Charged Poise RR at "added to it, turning distortion into new pattern," reweighting truth as shapable seed with conceptual cost of eternal margins legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (station, Elara, post-fever). Single scene with clean wanderer transition; no lens ambiguity. Cost proof: exact final sentences crystallize before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's creaks, ozone, gusts selectively mirror internal sway and constrain via liminality, charging closure as Elara shapes illustration amid winds. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (peripheral hums amid focus on paper). Recurring illustration as micro-setting evolves causally, recharging final image. Weather subtly guides endurance choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weigh truth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via smudge reversal and wanderer deepening that narrows to renunciation of burden. Agency in adding to smudge forecloses prior clarity-seeking with on-page cost (accepts swaying rhythm). Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution. Entry to high band via visible trade-off charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-process emerges organically from particulars (smudge evolves to resilient pattern), final image offering non-literal reconfiguration of imperfections as beauty without moral. Subtext in wanderer implications and silences enriches ambiguity. Resonance reweights swaying certainties from haunting to dance. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (peripheral details like ozone/scent amid focus). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("roots... crack surface"), advances stakes via wisdom exchange. Rhythmic diction modulates intensity (short realizations at peak). No head-hopping; perceptual bias consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "finger brushing... smudged a line" advances multiple jobs). Rhythm varies (short poignant lines at sorrow peak); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs (swaying pattern taught early). Zero artifacts in closure beat. Read-aloud natural escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fault-tolerant oracle in liminal station transforms truth-trope via evolving botanical metaphor, inevitable in hindsight at smudge-addition turn. Risks lyric introspection without gimmick, heightening stakes through auroral tone. No derivative templates; particulars (alpine flower, margins) anchor originality. Bold acceptance of ambiguity as resilience.</comment>
