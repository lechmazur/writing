<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority defaults to abstract labels like "saw patterns where others saw chaos" without particular struggle. Epiphany at atrium feels unearned, no simultaneous impulses acting in scene. Final purpose ("share his reckonings") credible endurance but no visible cost scaled to stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual builds density in patterns/ripples to CR closure ("his own noctilucent reckoning") reweighting purpose with felt clarity cost in final image. Orientation anchored early (Pearl Bay, dawn, glazier). One tightening via rings' whisper prompting atrium pull suffices; cost legible in "foreclosing" shift awareness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (mist hum, ripple rings, prism facets) filtered through glazier's light bias constrain choices (pond toss, atrium pull) and charge final prism image. Atmosphere tensions mundane-magical intersection purposefully. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent across dock-pond-atrium-dock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clarity before shift) signaled early but escalation thin under Textural lens—one density shift (rings to reckoning) without narrowing options or agency trade-off. No reversal tests commitment; abstract pressure lacks visceral cost until vague final resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of mundane's value emerges organically from ripple/atrium images, not statement; final dawn walk offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting chaos-to-hope without moralizing. Subtext in overlooked patterns invites ambiguity. Minor overtness ("extraordinary in the ordinary") but complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (light patterns, intersections) biased to glazier; rhythmic modulation builds to hummed resonance peak. Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early via ritual. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphor density (rainbow facets, ripple stories) patterned around light/mist; rhythm varies for dawn build without loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in atrium glow but no muddle at closure image. Propulsion clear, no paraphrase churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier rituals and noctilucent concept transforms epiphany trope via tangible light/ripple physics; prism reprise risks lyric boldness heightening stakes without gimmick. No template echoes; particular bay details anchor originality.</comment>
