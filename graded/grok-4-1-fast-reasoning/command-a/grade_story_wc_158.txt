<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to photosynthesize pain drives consistent endurance, but contradictory impulses like creeping doubt do not act simultaneously in scene; shy resolve dominates without embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from wandering to alcove surge to shell hum tightening; CR closure in final lullaby/exhale reconfigures pain harmony with felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shell constrains via chambers/alcove sanctuary and charges closure exhale; postcard handled tactilely to inspire, mirroring internal vastness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pain-to-beauty signaled early escalates accumulatively via work intensification and hum reversal narrowing to harmony; agency in persistent singing forecloses overwhelm with time cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Blossom armistice theme emerges implicitly from singing absorption to universal bridge; final step-out/stars wink offers non-literal reconfiguration of longing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual shimmer/warmth bias and rhythmic modulation; stable single POV with purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propels with varied lyric syntax, but minor paraphrase loops in "wind carried" (twice) and "shell seemed" (multiple) dull mid-density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of shell sanctuary and pain-photosynthesis transforms isolation trope; "off-key wind" lullabies heighten stakes organically.</comment>
