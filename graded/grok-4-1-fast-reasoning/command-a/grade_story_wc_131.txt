<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel discovery, rooted in "kindly methodical" traits that align actions, but interiority remains poetic-summary rather than deeply contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final endurance earned but lacks embodied cost in pivotal tape moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via fragment discoveries building density to CR closure ("memories begin to lift" reconfigures visibility premise with felt emotional cost on-page); single scene oriented immediately, no shards or breaks violate defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (sapphire hush, cold air, pipe hum) selectively filter through POV's methodical perception, constraining choices (following pipes) and charging final image (shadows retreat mirroring internal lift); recurring fragments as micro-setting evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover to connect/visibility) signaled early with accumulative deepening via fragment density, narrowing to absorption as lights return; agency in methodical work forces endurance, but external pressure low and cost mostly internal without sharp trade-off at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserved voices bridging isolation emerges organically from fragment puzzle and dweller's cached memories, with final tape plea offering non-literal resonant reweighting; ambiguity in visibility's cost lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (methodical sensing of "ferromagnetic pull," hushed reverence); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to light, compression purposeful without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("fragments" recurrence purposeful yet borders redundancy; "methodical" echoes slightly templated) dull two mid-beats without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphorical premise of crawl space dweller as hidden preserver transforms isolation tropes through tape cache synthesis; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established pattern, risking poetic conceit without gimmick.</comment>
