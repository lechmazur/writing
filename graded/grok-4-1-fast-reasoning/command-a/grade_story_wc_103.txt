<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in time obsession and ancestors clear, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; final self-discovery feels told via epiphany ("discovered herself") without earned micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to vortex; CR closure via time-texture revelation and memory restoration legible with felt cost of terrifying overwhelm and fragment loss at pedestal moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (damp earth, rustling leaves) filtered through designer's bias; hyperbolic geometry warping paths constrains navigation and charges clearing reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking time signaled early; one tightening via path-warping density increase forces focus shift, with agency in fragment placement; cost felt in vortex pull but lacks deeper option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory decay vs. restoration emerges organically from fragment rite; final garden brighter image offers non-literal reweighting of premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature on time layers; rhythmic prose modulates from reverie to intensity without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density high in opening ("roots intertwined like ancient whispers") without taught pattern or climax payoff, dulling propulsion; minor "as though/felt/seemed" loops in maze beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Temporal labyrinths with halo fragment synthesize fresh angle on memory tropes; risk in hyperbolic space-time weave heightens stakes organically.</comment>
