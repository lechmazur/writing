<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in childhood moonflower drives journey and painting; embodied awe at cathedral shows particularity. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—realization feels smoothly epiphanic without micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from postcards to cathedral visit to mural, culminating in CR closure ("flowers bloom at night because even in darkness, there is beauty") with felt cost of honoring unseen history. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via visit pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (stained glass shards, amber glow) mirror internal states and constrain artistic observation; recurrent postcards and windows charge final image. Cathedral choreography coherent, evolved with sun dip.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dawning hush, understand nocturnal beauty) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at cathedral ("saw not just images but emotions"); agency in journey decision forecloses imaginative-only path with time/sorrow cost. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, internalized without visceral opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of persistent beauty in darkness emerges via layered images (moonflower, glass, night-blooming mural) without statement; final CR reweights premise non-literally. Minor echo in articulated realization ("flowers bloom at night...") borders thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with artistic perceptual signature (light as breath, colors breathing); voice texture modulates poetically from quiet drive to awe-filled hush. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and density advance mood; sentence propulsion fits accumulative builds. Overwriting in repetitive phrases ("dawning hush," "quiet drive") creates minor paraphrase loops mid-beats, dulling peak cathedral intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist-muse journey via moonflower/night bloom motif transforms introspection trope organically. Familiar epiphanic arc lacks bold risk, reading as polished but safe poetic reflection.</comment>
