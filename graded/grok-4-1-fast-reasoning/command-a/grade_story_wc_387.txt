<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to appreciate hidden effort is consistent and rooted in net-mender traits, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the final smile and deliberate whistle feel like low-stakes endurance without embodied conflict or micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via images (fireflies, moon paths) to Conceptual Repricing closure in final paragraph's self-pattern realization; orientation anchors Elara, parapet, post-rain by para 2; tightening via whistle echo awakens thoughts, with felt cost in crystallized peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (damp stone, jasmine, firefly glow) filters through Elara's philosophical bias, with bamboo whisk as micro-setting grounding reflection and charging final image as she leaves with it; subtle guidance in leaning on railing, wind carrying whistle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort via patterns) signaled early but remains internal/abstract with no reversal narrowing options; accumulative deepening via thought crystallization sufficient but lacks visible price altering tactics, yielding low pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort/patterns emerges organically from fireflies/whisk/images, with final image offering resonant CR repricing patterns as internal; weakened by overt statements like "testament to the hidden effort of its maker," bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeking notices (moon paths as rivers); rhythmic prose modulates contemplative intensity, diction controlled and character-specific without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solid density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but −0.6 for paraphrase loops ("hidden effort/patterns" redundant across paras 4-6) and minor overwriting in "scintillatingly somber" register drift; no closure impact, but template-like repetition dulls peak reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mender philosopher tracing firefly moon paths with whisk reprise transforms contemplative vignette beyond template lyricism; risk in demure tone heightens quiet stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
