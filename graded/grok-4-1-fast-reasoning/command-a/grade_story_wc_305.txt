<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's traits as caretaker shine in garden tending and decisive map-following, with embodied unrest in tree-climbing; internal conflict emerges in betrayal forgiveness leading to yearning. Lake visions deliver a credible arc to wholeness, but epiphany feels slightly told via summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final climb earns endurance with felt cost of prior unrest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hairpin drop incites, shell touch deepens via map, lake visions cadence-shift reweights rebirth cycle with conceptual cost of transformed perspective. Orientation anchors early in grotto/garden; closure CR lands on-page as hairpin glows brighter post-lake, reconfiguring unrest into practice. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like "moss-covered stone" and "iridescent surface" filter through Elara's priorities, with hairpin recurring to constrain retrieval and charge final pocket secure. Grotto above clouds and luminous lake evolve causally, mirroring internal clarity; micro-setting (hairpin/shell) shapes pivotal choices without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment source) signaled early in unrest, accumulates via hairpin/map/shell to lake deepening that forces stance crystallization; stepping into lake shows agency foreclosing doubt-path with emotional cost. Escalation fits lens with pattern break in visions narrowing options to rebirth embrace; cost legible in emerged understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rebirth theme emerges organically from hairpin visions and forgiveness cycle, with final oak perch reweighting prior yearning non-literally. Subtext in overlooked shell implies growth via particulars; avoids moralizing though woman's speech borders direct—resonance holds in hairpin's warmed symbol.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias in garden shifts and vision flood; voice texture modulates lyrical calm to surge energy without drift. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("You've come"), advances revelation; no head-hopping, diction fits earthy mystic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short vision bursts amid longer reflections; density high but minor paraphrase loops in "cycle of rebirth" (three echoes) dull slightly. No heavy artifacts, metaphors coherent (hair "flowed like the wind"); propulsion clear, closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mystical artifact quest to rebirth epiphany transforms forgiveness trope via grotto specificity, but core premise echoes familiar fantasy journeys without bold risk. Hairpin-map twist earns mild ingenuity in hindsight; emotional truth solid but lacks non-obvious synthesis for elite freshness.</comment>
