<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions (heart raced, mind racing) and micro-choices (drone deployment, chart study) align with motivation to decode belonging, earning the final resolve; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain (drone anomaly → tapestry pull → pieces → assembly → holographic resonance as CR closure); orientation anchored early; cost legible in "strange resonance within him" reconfiguring self-understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dust/parchment smell, cold air, fractured colors) integrated into action filter through Kael's priorities; observatory constrains via passages/tower/vault, charging final star-guided exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reassemble chip) signaled early with causal tightening (each piece find narrows to next via drone/charts); minimal opposition or visible cost weakens pressure—success too frictionless despite agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically via missing pieces mirroring self-fragmentation, culminating in resonant CR ("missing pieces were...fragments of himself"); non-literal final image reweights quest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with consistent perceptual signature (sharp eyes scanning/noting); rhythmic prose modulates focus under rising determination; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor loops ("perpetually surprised" x3, "glow" repetition) and overwriting ("brilliant dimness" oxymoron) dull propulsion slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone-tech in ancient observatory quest transforms tropes via "type foundry matrix chip" and self-belonging twist; risk in modern/ancient blend heightens without gimmickry.</comment>
