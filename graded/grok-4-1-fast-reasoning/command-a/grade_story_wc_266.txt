<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation intensifies through embodied micro-choices like clutching the frayed ticket and deliberate steps on the ridgeway; ferryman applies pressure as wise guide but lacks deeper flaws, slightly archetypal. Final punch earned by prior causality with felt tremble in fingers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from boat glide to mist ascent to cliff realization; on-page CR closure in "She punched the air, feeling the star imprint itself on her being" with journey cost legible in thinned air and blurred time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and mist constrain choices, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (salt scent narrowing to cool sand) mirrors internal vigil, with "mist clinging to her skin like a second cloak" integrating setting into ascent pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unused courage) signaled early tightens via ridgeway deepening that narrows to cliff confrontation; agency in traverse and punch forecloses leash path with on-page cost in "trembling" punch under accumulative pattern break.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of traverse over destination emerges organically from ticket-stamp motif shifting at punch; resonant non-literal answer in "The vigil is over... Now, go" reweights journey without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias in Mara's mist-cloaked noticing; voice modulates rhythmically from lullaby dialogue to terse "She punched the air," sustaining lyrical texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via varied sentence openings and sensory integration; minor overwrite in repeated "weight/mist" motifs slightly dulls mid-ascent density but spares closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry-ticket allegory transforms hero's journey via star-stamp imprint; risk in surreal ridgeway return heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight punch.</comment>
