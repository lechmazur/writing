<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in restoring trust via artisan skill, embodied in hands-on repair; blindness enables unique perception without contradiction. Lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making Elara idealized rather than flawed under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from drone disassembly to wings flickering life, culminating in CR closure via final image of shop as anchor-sanctuary with felt endurance cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via activation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Water features' light refraction constrains diagnosis ("each refraction a clue"), charging repair process and final image; sensory hierarchy blind-filtered (air shifts, hums over sight). Mist, oil/iron, depot pulse integrate purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone repair amid depot bustle) signaled early; tightening via core activation narrows to success with patience cost. Minimal reversal, but endurance forecloses failure path under Accumulative lens; stakes viscerally felt in methodical hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of machine-soul renewal emerges via particulars: drone hum harmonizing with depot, blindness as "lens" reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to trust rift; ambiguity in ongoing work lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with blind perceptual signature (light "danced through water," hums as "melody"); rhythmic prose modulates calmly. No dialogue; diction purposeful, sensory-biased without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor "hum" recurrence purposeful for pattern. No loops or scaffolds dull closure; "mist curled around her" images renewal crisply without overwriting in peak fix beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh blind artisan-drone repair via refraction in misted depot transforms tropes organically; final "blindness... lens" reconfigures sight motif inevitably. Risky quiet closure heightens thematic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
