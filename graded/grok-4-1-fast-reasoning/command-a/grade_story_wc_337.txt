<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (breath catching, trembling hands) and motivation rooted in personal loss compel persistence; micro-choice of whispering plea reveals contradictory unrest. Final realization of purpose feels earned via accumulated unraveling, with visible cost in heavy heart. Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing ("understood her true purpose") avoids deeper penalty as tied to on-page flood of whispers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers and knot resistance builds to cadence shift at last knot's release, yielding RR (Charged Poise) with legible cost ("heart heavy but at ease"; net sags). Single scene scope perfect; orientation anchored by para 1. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt; persistent constraint of net's reluctance shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary and stained glass constrain via prismatic shadows/hum that mirror internal hush, charging final image (prism on path). Sensory selection (glint of needle, faint whisper) reflects urgency; body/tool (fingers, needle) integrate purposefully. Environment evolves with events (light shifts, hush deepens), guiding choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits via unraveling) signaled early; accumulative escalation via stubborn knot refusal and whisper flood narrows options, forcing plea and breakthrough with agency. Cost visible (trembling hands, slower movements). One decisive tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honoring broken stories to mend self emerges organically from net/mask parallel and final realization; resonant non-literal answer in sagging net/stillness reweights unrest. Subtext in silence accumulation avoids moralizing; lingering ambiguity in her "ready to face whatever came next."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (traces edges, feels resistance as alive); diction/rhythm modulate with intensity (short pleas amid descriptive swells). Prose texture distinct (hush motifs purposeful); no head-hopping or withholding. Uncertainty in spirits taught early, pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory/action; purposeful hush/silence recurrence supports lens without loop excess. Minor paraphrase in "silence accumulate/hush deepened" deducts lightly as pattern-taught; no artifacts dull closure image. Strong verbs, concrete specificity throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restorer unraveling spirit-nets transforms restoration trope via textured communion; fisherman whispers ground ingenuity in hush accumulation. Risky lyric build heightens stakes to personal mending; no derivative echoes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
