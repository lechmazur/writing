<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies aesthetically, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; smooth interiority yields epiphanic declarations like "tremor of certainty" without embodied conflict, softening the surrender's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to chorus and lake-crack tightening; Charged Poise closure legible in "boundaries dissolve" with surrender cost felt on-page; orientation anchored early at frozen lake/atrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade as recurring micro-setting constrains recitation response and charges final glowing farewell; sensory details (hum, crunch, pulse) selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal merge without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transcend boundaries signaled early, textural escalation via hum-to-chorus deepening reweights identity; agency in "Speak" and recitation forces dissolution trade-off with legible surrender cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of crossing sacred boundaries emerges organically through merge and crack; final image of atrium's bow offers resonant non-literal answer, though "they understood: the sacred..." edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature in biased noticing (quartz pulse as heartbeat); rhythmic diction modulates intensity purposefully, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but mild paraphrase loops in "dissolving boundaries" thrice dull peak density slightly; figurative language pattern-taught as lyric voice, read-aloud rhythmic without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic transcendence via quartz-song merge transforms artist trope; specific images like shards floating upward feel inevitable, bold poetic risks heighten without gimmickry.</comment>
