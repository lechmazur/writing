<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to recover memories is clear and rooted in personal void, embodied in trembling hands at locket dig; however, lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making final realization feel smoothly competent without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from mushrooms to locket to stars alignment; on-page CR closure via "world holding its breath" and brighter glow reconfigures stake with felt shift cost, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like fogged glass, cool mushroom texture, salt-decay scent selectively mirror internal anticipation; fairy ring soil constrains pivotal dig choice and charges final alignment image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory recovery signaled early, tightens accumulatively via locket discovery narrowing to grandmother's path; cost felt in recognized emptiness but remains somewhat abstract without visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of folklore signs guiding broken past emerges organically from locket note and constellation reprise; final star-fairy ring image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting loss into beacon without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with folklorist perceptual bias in noticing symbols; distinct literary texture modulates rhythm from creaking tension to poised cadence, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Repetitive "decades later" phrasing (3x) and curiosity restatements create paraphrase loops dulling density; rhythm varies but stock embodiments like "heart pounding" add minor scaffold in pivotal dig beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy rings, shipwrecked greenhouse, and broken constellations transforms folklore tropes into personal memory quest; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
