<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to save language clear and intensifies via curse drain, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; final guardian shift earned yet interiority leans on summary like "heart filled with accomplishment."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as echo density builds to pattern/song then silence; closure as RR (language etched post-shatter) with legible cost in "Lira collapsed to her knees, her body trembling."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tunnel walls pulse and provide patterns constraining song tactics; canyon/echoes charge final image of etched stories and softened towers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively via melody discovery to draining surge forcing endurance; cost unmistakable in "strength waning, her vision blurring" during climax song.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial preservation emerges organically from texture-to-sound arc; final canyon etching offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting language death without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm advances momentum; minor "echoes" repetition purposeful for texture, no loops or scaffold dulling closure shatter image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Copper-veins and texture-to-sound premise synthesize fresh fantasy angle; bird patterns transform echo trope organically toward harmony closure.</comment>
