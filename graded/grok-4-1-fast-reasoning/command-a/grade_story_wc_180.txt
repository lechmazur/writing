<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied pauses with ribbon ("fingers brushed the ribbon again, and she paused") revealing contradictory regret and hope; final persistence earned by prior causality without unearned epiphany. Minor label-speak in "endearingly feisty" lacks embodied trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with tool actions building density to RR closure ("ribbon, now woven into the glowing tree"); cost legible in "lifelong task" foreclosing easy renewal. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration ("air thick with scent," "branches swaying in encouragement") mirrors internal shift; orchard rafters constrain climb and altar access, charging final image under recurring object test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend vow/self) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tool experiments forcing realization ("breach wasn’t a failure but necessary shedding"); agency in persist/whisper narrows options with felt past pain cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Renewal-from-brokenness emerges organically via orchard/tools/particulars, not statement; final image ("ribbon’s faint glow lingered") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (quartz eyes "catching light in fragments"); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to purposeful without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm propels to closure. Minor paraphrase loop on ribbon/renewal in reflective beats dulls one mid-section slightly without touching end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mender's trade in orchard-cathedral transforms renewal trope; tools' magical responses feel inevitable from established pattern, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
