<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied senses ("hands smell of sand, resin") and contradictory impulses (theft as vow against elders' script); final oath change from "counting to keeping, from keeping to offering" earned by causal buildup of jar and buttons. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like quiet inspiration drive struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jar tilt to button-matching pulses to ledger bridge, culminating in CR/RR closure ("prophecy soften into clay") with conceptual cost of unsealed communal story; orientation anchored immediately in warehouse/cliffs; no causality breaks, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (sweating glass, shale voice, trembling shelves) constrains choices (ease lid with breath, pin to ledger) and charges final image (warehouse open to cliff, buttons as planets); POV bias filters through turner's priorities; micro-setting of jars/buttons evolves causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscramble prophecy via theft/jar) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through button method narrowing echo into bridge; agency in sorting/pinning forecloses rigid script with felt cost (confessed theft risks punishment, resolved communally); minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch before villagers' arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy as "loom" not line emerges organically from particulars (buttons as decisions slipped, ledger as bridge), resonant non-literal close ("clay, quick between the fingers") reweights without moralizing; earned wisdom from concrete struggle avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("hush leans back," "moth comes, crooked and sure") with rhythmic modulation under inspiration/theft pressure; stable POV distance biases toward tactile patience (resin hands) and doubt; purposeful lyric compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied syntax, no loops); figurative language pattern-taught early as voice-motivated texture without muddle or drift, though pervasive metaphors in peak button-matching slightly risks coherence; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hourglass-turner mythos with buttons as "decisions that slipped" and echo-jar loom transforms prophecy trope; bold lyric risk (cataloging as unscrambling) heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from opening theft to communal lantern.</comment>
