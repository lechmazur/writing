<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hurry or hush under chased stillness) act in the mantled thing's test; final shard-aligning despite warning earns stasis with embodied cost in dome's groan.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from lens placement to SOR release, delivering Charged Poise RR closure; cost legible in "water slackens like a vow kept" after scraping anchors on bone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library vents and tethers constrain ritual choices, charging final dry sigh and etched stamp as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mantled thing's patient forehead on dome forces endurance under Accum lens, narrowing to beacon release with cost in miscall-storm risk and groan.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lens shifts from shattered heart to mosaic routes, offering non-literal answer to rest-as-address without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("names feel waterlogged," signals as "staccato shaking of the soul") biases toward addresses, rhythmic control heightens pressure in short peak sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>SOR code from SOS via library beacon synthesizes tropes into fresh address-registry for dead, risk-taking in lyric underwater ritual heightens stakes.</comment>
