<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to find the unlearned library drives consistent, intensifying choices like mapping gaps and bargaining with lamplighter; rescue of apprentice via "conjugations like ladders" embodies traits resourcefully. Internal conflict emerges in gentle failure-pronouncing rehearsal without full contradiction in peak scene. Secondary characters apply pressure without diluting single-POV coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetic density of gaps, rearrangements, and diary cues builds to CR closure where blank spines open and seeds sprout questions with conceptual cost of perpetual self-rescue. Orientation anchors early ("mountain bookstore," "arcane linguist"); no debt. Traveler's return and rehearsal tighten path legibly without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore constrains choices (e.g., "run of missing atlases," "hush between biographies and bestiaries") and charges final image (blank spines, petrified moss lectern). Sensory details like "peppermint bark and distant thunder" filter through POV urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Spatial choreography coherent across ascents.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding library) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via diary-guided rescues and geometry renegotiation, narrowing to rehearsal failure-pronouncing with felt cost in "err without exile." Apprentice extraction tests commitment; traveler's reappearance complicates without resolving coincidentally. Protagonist agency in mapping gaps drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of retrieving unlearned lessons emerges organically from rescue missions and gap-research, reweighted in final image of sprouting "might-have-beens" without moralizing. Subtext in silences (e.g., lamplighter's question) and implications invites ambiguity on forgetting vs. remembering. Closing chord hums resonant non-literal answer to self-forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with perceptual bias ("consonants that hum," "air tastes similar") stable in first-person; syntax modulates rhythmically from breathy lists to tight climax whispers. Lamplighter dialogue natural/subtextual ("why chase a library that forgets"); no head-hopping. Purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via image-charged sentences; rhythm varies (short punchy rescues amid flowing aisles). Heavy figuration consistent and pattern-taught (bookstore as organ/symphony), but occasional density overloads high-pressure rescue ("suspended in a footnote... no bird could decode") risks minor muddle without obscuring closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living bookstore-as-labyrinth with diary ferns mapping omissions transforms tropes into gap-research ingenuity. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes (silence remembering unlocks library) without gimmickry; final seed-sprouting inevitable from prior particulars. No derivative echoes; voice commits boldly to fable-logic.</comment>
