<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses vividly embodied in the fear of "too much gilded hush" where child stops wanting doors, driving the careful "limiting exposure"; final sharing choice earned through prior collecting beats with relational cost in vulnerability to father.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence flavors build density toward resonant reconfiguration (RR) at sharing "gilded hush," with legible cost in softened blueprints and widened entrances; two-shard structure (trellis to shop) transitions cleanly without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Xenial trellis and cloudgrass cups constrain climb and tasting choices while charging final image of "corridors bending into arches"; sensory tastes (citrus ache, honey through linen) filter through POV's silence-greed, evolving with gravity inversion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding father's silence tightens accumulatively via rare "gilded hush" discovery and sharing, forcing trade-off of exposure; cost legible in child's "careful for both our sakes" and father's leaned pause, charging collaborative closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as "home" emerges organically from tasting particulars reweighted in father's "safe like stepping into a room you have never left," offering non-literal resonance without moralizing; counter-readings in claustrophobia linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in silence-tasting diction ("honey strained through linen") modulates rhythm with pressure, stable single-POV; father's brief dialogue distinct in terse idiom, advancing goal without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pulse burr like a trapped moth" advances character/atmosphere); figurative pattern taught early as voice-pollen avoids muddle, but minor synonym churn in "hush"/"quiet" across tasting beats dulls one peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy physics (gravity inversion ladders) with silence flavors transforms claustrophobia trope into "mapped hush"; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via doll's thump-to-heart evolution.</comment>
