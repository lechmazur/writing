<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in planting deceptive marble for mercy yet confessing it under maze pressure; embodied in "bones quiet as twigs" during kneel; earned closure via vine's tasting soil, foreclosing deception with honest care.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rituals build density to maze objection (new corridor), confession tightens to Charged Poise in exchanged nods; cost legible in unlatched gate trusting night entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains choices—hedges part post-confession, dead fountain forces kneel; recurring marbles/orbital placement charges final image; sensory hierarchy (hiss, tremble) biases through pragmatic gardener's notice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove garden reciprocity) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via objection and confession narrowing deception path; agency in explaining "why I had lied" forces trade-off, cost in relenting hedges felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (patience mirrors fortune) emerges from vine-leash memory to equal nods; final image reweights premise—maze wears my age—without moral, lingering ambiguity in "blooming and withering in equal breaths."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: garden anthropomorphized via "hedges hissed," "dials bowed like courtiers"; rhythmic poetic compression taught early, peaks legible under pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: every line multi-jobs (e.g., "needles steadied to a calm percentage" advances plot/atmosphere); metaphors coherent ("trembled like gnats"), no loops; propulsion varies rhythm to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh premise of measurable luck yields sentient maze reciprocity; risk in poetic agency (vines leash wrist) transforms tropes organically, inevitable in hindsight via mended deception arc.</comment>
