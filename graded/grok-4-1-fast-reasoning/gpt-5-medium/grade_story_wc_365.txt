<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and sensory-specific, with embodied ache mapped as wind; child's hesitation mirrors adult micro-choices in tuning shard, earning closure acceptance without epiphany cliché. Contradictory impulses act in viewing own back bending closer. Final fold of child into chart reveals hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of parallel shards taught early via smell-doorway builds to CR closure where truth integrates with undeniable weight ("found it heavy"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in shard-warmed palm at "weigh it without flinching."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (smell first) filters bay vividly, with chains/tools constraining touch-exploration and terminal/shard as micro-settings enabling reveal; bay evolves causally from frost to unlocked across strands, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (withheld truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through self-revelation across universes, narrowing to renunciation of erasure; agency in splicing coordinates forecloses blame path with felt weight on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redirecting truth emerges organically from particulars like fuel sigh and pulse-sync; final image ("redirect the lost, one heartbeat per world") offers resonant CR reweighting withheld silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("fear is a scent"); rhythmic compression modulates with intensity, stable single-POV lyrical texture taught early via weaving, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied syntax/rhythm; purposeful metaphors (alarms as aurora) cohere without muddle, minor figurative density in reveal balanced by pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory multiverse mapping transforms evacuation trope via irreplaceable shard/prism; risky mosaic heightens stakes, inevitable CR feels bold yet grounded in rhythms.</comment>
