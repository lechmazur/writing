<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through grief-embodied failures like "metal would not take a polish"; contradictory impulses in not crying yet clicking "Illuminate"; final endurance as tutor earned by prior communal micro-choices with visible cost in patient waiting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from personal stencil projection to communal rituals; closure as Charged Poise/CR in "This is the work... to illuminate what refuses itself, and to wait," cost legible in enduring "patient dark" and mechanism's settling breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory dome and projector constrain choices (hidden keys, password "his name," vellum projection); final image charged by "lily still glowed faintly where fingerprints warmed the glass," mirroring internal hinge; sensory hierarchy biased to light/dust via jeweler's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transform personal grief into teaching blooms; escalation via mother's temporary tattoos turning to aurora, deepening communal pressure and forcing "curtains of intention" explanation; cost in hesitation soldered into rings, charging final endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of intention as loom emerges organically from lily projections and wire rituals; resonant non-literal answer in final "smallest, truest heat," reweighting grief from mangled weave to hinged learning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in weaving/light metaphors ("thread ourselves by what we mean," "curtains of intention"); stable first-person POV with lyric compression taught early, modulating rhythm to subdued intensity; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in mother's query.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "Light found dust like a river finds silt"; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test; minor deduction for figurative density persisting into mother's beat without pause, though pattern-taught and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry, planetarium projections, and origami invites as grief loom; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of communal vulnerability; final "coordinates in the margin of my heart" inevitable from particulars.</comment>
