<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between algorithmic tending and ritual burn act in scene, earning final chest-loosening with cost of defying systems.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to tin-burn reconfiguration; cost legible in "rib of code had unlatched," charging poise without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Domed enclosure's tilting compass and fog constrain rudder-shape choice between rows, mirroring internal reorientation in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Agency in miniaturizing burn tightens stakes texturally, foreclosing infinite balance with cost of pumps shuddering and fog uncurling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Roses retracting post-burn offers resonant answer to surviving shift, reweighting tin-fears as care's frame without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses circuits with organic drift ("strangely organic chest loosen"), rhythmic control heightens burn pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; coherent metaphors like "water burns in memory" avoid muddle, zero loops in closure burn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mineral-hearted roses and moth-wing flame synthesize fresh sci-fi lyricism; tin-rudder turn feels inevitable from fragmented logic.</comment>
