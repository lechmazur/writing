<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through contradictory impulses, e.g., sleeping in haunted room despite claiming bunk below; motivation to protect hush compels micro-choices like stone-stacking with visible endurance cost at close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from lamp's death to letter-reading and final dawn image; CR closure in stones/sea glass reconfigures safety with conceptual cost of ache legible in "waves could almost reach them."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sea glass and lantern room as micro-settings constrain choices (held for ghosts, placed on sill) and charge final image; sensory details like "wings brushed the glass" filter through keeper's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bottling safety tightens accumulatively via lamp failure, hauntings, and skipper's early arrival forcing letter exchange; cost felt in prior keeper's drowning echoed in final vulnerable stones, though one deepening dominates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of safety as "luminescent ache" emerges organically from letter chain and images, reweighted in final "paper boat" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in dawn stones/sea glass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (e.g., skipper as "tidepool holding sunlight"); rhythmic modulation under storm pressure with purposeful lyric compression, stable first-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm accelerating through "wings brushed the glass"; figurative language pattern-taught (light/glass motifs) without muddle, propelling to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse trope via stone messages and letter chain into "luminescent ache"; risky lyric risk heightens stakes in anonymous current, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
