<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in cataloging fear while writing under pressure; Mara's dance forces micro-choices revealing values; final release earned via prior hesitations with visible relational cost. Exceptional internal specificity avoids labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dance/dice builds to RR closure ("names back into our mouths") with conceptual cost of encoded revolt; orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken lab's silt/flood constrains dance and journal tactics, charging final vent-opening image; sensory hierarchy (silt sketches, drowned machines) mirrors defiance without catalog; micro-setting (glass tablets) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate memories) signaled early, escalates via dice warnings/doubt deepening under accumulative lens; agency in choreography forecloses paths with on-page risk (blue warning waltz); cost unmistakable in incorporated slips.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-strength emerges implicitly via dice hesitations to bridge-building entries; final knot-to-bow reconfigures premise without moralizing; resonance from particulars like noose-letters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (tide/shore, toes sketching clefs) taught early, modulates rhythm with pressure; purposeful compression legible to charged poise; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated into action (skirt haloing silt); rhythmic variety supports propulsion; minor figurative density in opening risks slight opacity but pattern-taught without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-cipher in flooded lab transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable to voice-crossing payoff; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
