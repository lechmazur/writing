<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oracle's obsession manifests in concrete micro-choices like noting "the length between two distant crashes," earning courier's shift from burning records; courier's snort-to-admission arc shows contradictory skepticism yielding to embodied change without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density builds to Charged Poise closure where courier bows and departs with booklet, cost legible in oracle's bleeding fingers scratching stones ("Her fingers bleed into the grooves").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ridge fort's wet stone and flaking gold constrain choices (pried open amid salt-stinging rain, later scratched as backup map), charging final image where "fort grows taller by not falling."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping endless night tightens texturally when courier admits burn mission and space "opens where his fear had been," forcing renunciation with cost of torn sleeve and altered path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of night as lacunae-map emerges implicitly via pauses-as-coordinates, resonant non-literal closure in "sea graduates into a gentler noise" reweighting endless night as breathable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "gold leaf bruising under rain like ripened fruit"; dialogue subtextual (courier snorts at "thin faith," oracle counters with sensations); rhythmic control modulates hush under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., short "Go" amid long lyric lines); purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak ("star steadies like a nail"); zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms oracle trope into silence-cartographer, with risk-taking lyric accumulation yielding inevitable "cartography of pauses" that heightens endurance stakes.</comment>
