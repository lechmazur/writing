<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation as "creeping normality noticer" compels concrete micro-choices like pressing the orris shard, with embodied emotion in trembling hands at the beetle tin; interiority particular via perceptual bias toward displacements. Final realization earns change through prior house visits' causality, foreclosing ignorance with conceptual cost. Minor abstractness in "inadvertently profound" note slightly tempers peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern-taught mosaic of three houses building density to CR closure: "some houses feel alive because we give them our pauses"; orientation anchors by para 2 ("quiet bay in spring"). Shard use links shards motivationally without breaks. Cost legible in final image's reweighting of premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via bay's "tide slurred the pebbles like patient breathing," mirroring house-breath stake and charging final tin discovery; sensory hierarchy (smell of "damp rope and dill") filters through narrator's noticing bias. Details evolve causally with light deepening. Recurrent orris/object charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding alive houses) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: first house shelters story, second resists (tightening via cold shard), third deepens with tin patience; agency in shard placement forces trade-offs. Cost felt in "hands trembled with the weight of tiny vows." Subtle, no sharp reversal, fits lens but tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: houses live via "inadvertent ritual of attention," resonant CR in final line reweighting displacements without moralizing; subtext in spoon's "tide's small applause" implies human pauses. Particulars like beetle tin avoid platitudes, inviting ambiguity on ritual's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kettle's whistle grows fainter, when frames breathe") biases toward subtle shifts; rhythmic prose modulates from hushed to "thunder" at revelations. Stable first-person, no leakage; purposeful compression legible under textural lens payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "orr is holds smell like old houses hold whispers"; rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion matches scene slack-to-deepening. Heavy figurative density ("quiet lightning," "needle's amber eye") risks muddle in house 2 but stays voice-consistent without obscuring closure tin image. Minor synonym churn on "displaced" purposeful for motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of noticing displacements as house aliveness, transformed via orris method and tin payoff; fresh angle on anthropomorphism via "shard of hush." Bold lyric mosaic risks high but coheres stakes; no template echoes, inevitable hindsight via ritual reweighting.</comment>
