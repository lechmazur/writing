<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses as "closure seeker who opens wounds" act in anesthesia ritual and tunnel planting, earning renunciation of personal miracle with embodied cost in "loam and apology"; internal voice particularizes flaw without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as motifs densify to Charged Poise RR in cracking hourglass and ivy plant, reconfiguring closure with legible cost in "teach me to read it in living scars"; orientation anchored by dawn tower wake; one tightening at tunnel descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel chamber's "fossilized morning" coffee ring and moss/ferns constrain kneel/plant choice, charging final image; recurring desk rings to scar mirror internal states through POV bias; micro-setting vivid, selective sensory hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of scar-reading closure signaled early, deepens via plants' reassurance reveal narrowing to tunnel stasis; agency in hourglass crack forecloses wound-reopening path with "wind under my ribs" cost; internal pressure coheres accumulatively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final ivy plant offers non-literal CR answer to wound/closure question, reweighting miracle from theft to "carry her steadiness" without moralizing; theme emerges organically from ring/fossil particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in plant-telepathic bias ("ivy asks, shall we go") and rhythmic hush modulation under post-anesthesia stress; stable first-person with purposeful compression; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful "hush" pattern taught early; minor figurative density in reflective beats ("roots that braid time") without muddle or closure dull; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, coffee-ring scrying, displaced miracle transforms grief tropes into tunnel fossil reprise; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
