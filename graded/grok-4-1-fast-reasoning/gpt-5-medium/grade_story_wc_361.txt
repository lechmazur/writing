<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (jittery yet holds stillness for ritual) act in the delivery scene, earning the courier's endurance of mentor's absence with felt cost in the thinning corridor. Widow as secondary applies relational pressure via shared breath. Mentor absence compels micro-choice to hold pitch alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from climb to ritual germination, closure as Charged Poise in thinning corridor and ridge hush, cost legible in "he is not there, except he never will be again." Orientation anchored early in ridgeway route. Single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridgeway hums and sings, constraining ritual pitch; pendant and bone tube as micro-settings handled tactilely, charging final throbbing heart image. Sensory bias (sounds over sights) reflects courier's perceptual signature. Aurora pours like sap, mirroring thaw laughter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax wonder via relic message) signaled early, tightens texturally in shared breath germination narrowing grief-to-connection. Agency in tuning frequency forecloses separation with relational cost in overlap thinning. Persistent pendant constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of planting continuance emerges from ritual particulars, resonant in final ridge pulse reweighting courier's courier/gardener role without moral. Yew sprig shifts from rattle to ground, echoing wonder-from-routine. No tidy resolution; absence lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (vibrations, hums, pitches) biases noticing, stable without slippage; rhythm modulates from jittery ascent to poised ritual hush. Prose texture reflects courier's sympathetic vibration motif. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with vibrational metaphors consistent/pattern-taught, propelling from ascent to closure without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short ritual sentences amid lyric flow). No figurative muddle; peak "corridor thins" clear/propulsive. Ear-test flows naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh sympathetic-vibration relic premise transforms ghost-contact trope via textured ritual, risk-taking lyric synthesis inevitable in hindsight; ridge/pendant logic commits fully, heightening continuance stakes.</comment>
