<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in repair hesitation ("ruin teaches what perfection hides" vs. ache compelling action), earning final realization with embodied cost of perpetual waking hurt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via sensory build to CR closure; gear repair unravels snag, opening corridor to notebooks with legible conceptual cost of endless groves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mechanical details like "bark stamped with serials" constrain path through wind guidance; axle-tree charges final ticking image, mirroring internal calibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hum's ache-to-smooth shift tightens stake under textural lens; agency in wind-listening and repair forces trade-off, charging notebooks' cost of interior distance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Notebook reprise reweights translocation as self-teaching without moralizing; final "filed its teeth" resonates wild frontier promise through charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "grammar of polished brass" biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from hum ache to smooth plane without slippage.</comment>
