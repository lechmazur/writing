<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's wilting near postmaster's "moved" lie ("the word moved tasted like mildew") forces refusal, embodying contradictory impulses and earning communal leverage at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fragment causally unlocks hatch ("fit a broken escutcheon like a tooth finding its jaw") and escalates via notice to collective release, landing Charged Poise CR under Accumulative lens with postmaster's nod as cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse veins and zinc gutters constrain discovery ("postal plate fragment fit... hatch sighed"), charging final "shy rain" that uncurls leaves as resonant mirror.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Narrator's notice ("no more leaf-post until archives reopen") tightens stakes under Accumulative lens, forcing councilwoman's truth and postmaster's yield with dry days as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final mist "fed the lettuce and the tired" reweights archived mercy as drought, offering non-literal answer to candor-as-water without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leaf-vein perceptual signature ("etching names... onto living veins") biases noticing and heightens jar discovery without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Syntax varies propulsion from bench quiet ("something rattled under the bench") to release crescendo; zero loops, metaphors cohere in closure "jars breathed again."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Word-jars archiving confessions transforms epistolary dystopia via leaf-truth detector, risking poetic compression that heightens candor stakes inevitably.</comment>
