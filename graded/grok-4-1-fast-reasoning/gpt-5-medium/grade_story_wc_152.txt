<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—pretending foolishness while stitching truths—act in scene, earning final acceptance of blame-role with visible cost in stained cloth and carried rumor. Keeper applies subtle pressure via quivering wrist and starwash. Internal voice particular, embodied in pricked finger and thread-dabbing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stitched pauses to whisper hardening into blame-speech, closing in Charged Poise of tucked satchel and candle-watching sleep with felt cost of impending blame. Orientation anchored early in arrival line. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eternal candle and trembling cloth constrain choices and charge final image of candle watching window. Sensory hierarchy (echoed silence, dust constellations, flame bending) reflects listening priorities. Autumn observatory micro-setting tactile, lived-in via brass palms and glass glove.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of listening for stories tightens texturally when pattern opens "throat" revealing falsified charts, forcing narrator's loosening of threads with cost in snapped ends and accepted blame. Agency in micro-choices narrows fool's path. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fool-stitched truths emerges implicitly from loosening knots and jester-hat stitch, answered resonantly in final sleep-travel without moralizing. Subtext in pauses and whispers reweights rumors as wandering stars. Complexity lingers in coup's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cosmic metaphors ("rumor is a wandering star," "stories...trapped birds") biases noticing toward pauses and shivers. First-person POV stable, rhythmic control modulates from sighed domes to thrumming cello. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: each line layers image and pressure without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (ivy pattern, moth-truth), payoff in candle's final watch. Rhythm varies naturally, read-aloud ear strong; no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy-unraveling in poetic sci-fi frame feels inevitable, transforming fool-trope via blame-cost. Risks lyric density heighten stakes without opacity. Bold voice commits to premise fully.</comment>
