<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation as historian of small gestures drives micro-choices like guiding shaky elbows, with embodied contradiction in crisis actor past ("real blast braided my lungs") earning final loosening of scripts. Internal conflict acts in scene via ruthless benevolence toward participants. Final endurance of ungoverned archive feels compelled by prior causality, foreclosing victim role with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through spelled words (water to hush), tightening to charged poise in legible silence and penumbra travel. Orientation anchors early in gallery/interregnum. Closure CR lands on-page with conceptual cost of vanishing archive vs. new orders in final image, constraint of echoes shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains walking patterns and echo-reading, with marble rim and luminous absence filtering perception purposefully. Lantern and chessboard as micro-settings evolve tactilely, charging final image left behind. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency, narrowing to footsteps and breaths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archiving gestures escalates accumulatively via word-spelling density, narrowing to hush under door-click pressure. Agency in pattern-teaching forces participant endurance, with felt cost in shaky pride and scuffed shoes. Final reconfiguration crystallizes ungoverned memory with undeniable opportunity cost of new regency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures over spectacle emerges organically from footsteps-as-ink and pawn-people, reweighting loud crises. Final penumbra travel offers non-literal answer to interregnum history, embracing ambiguity of ungoverned echoes without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like taped shoes and napkin bread avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in luminous shadows and nomadic drift sustains first-person texture under pressure, modulating rhythmically. POV stable with no leakage, perceptual bias toward gestures character-specific. Prose syntax reflects mind's poetic archiving, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "taped shoes skidding in rhythm," propulsion varies rhythm without monotony. Figurative language coherent and pattern-taught (echoes, penumbra), no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor density in metaphors doesn't obscure peak hush beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whispering gallery as legible archive transforms interregnum trope via walking words and pawn-bodies. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of ephemeral record, inevitable in hindsight. Bold penumbra travel as closure avoids safety middle.</comment>
