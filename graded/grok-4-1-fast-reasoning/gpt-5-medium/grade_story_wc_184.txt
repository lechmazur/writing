<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in "warmly methodical" actions like counting wraps aloud and tucking rope loops; interiority particular via archival lens on gaps and fables. Mild contradictory impulses (job to clarify vs. sensing stories detach) act in scene without alternating summaries. Final merger earned by prior rope work, foreclosing worship of confusion with felt cost of patient labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of absences/patterns builds via seal, rope, ledger to RR closure in ledger-seal kiss where "letters straightened, dates aligned." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via staircase reveal pays off. Cost legible in final rope-tightening image, reconfiguring options without erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via rope braids crossed/uncrossed to dim/brighten door, charging final "tucking in a sleeping child" image. Sensory hierarchy (humming breath, warmed brass, vellum draft) reflects archivist's priorities. Micro-setting of mechanism room guides choices without exposition; coherent choreography tracks seal-to-frame, rope-to-ledger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate absence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via doorway widening on knot reconfiguration, narrowing to ledger merge. Agency in micro-choices like "twelve...nine...three" counts forecloses loose-end chaos with labor cost. Escalation coherent under textural lens, convergence at seal kiss with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-bridge emerges organically from rope braids, fables, ledger reunion without statement; final image "bridges are only doors that learned to stay" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in seal's "thirst" and untranslated note invites ambiguity. Resonance from particulars like mislabeled box, no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with archival perceptual signature: notices "catalog numbers rearranging," friction's grammar. Rhythmic modulation in peak (short counts amid translation) heightens pressure; diction controlled, purposeful compression taught early via fables pays off. No elision or head-hopping; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.9<comment>High density with multi-job lines like "He rested the seal impression against the frame, not as key, but as question"; rhythm varies (short counts vs. flowing thoughts). Minor scaffold in repeated "warmly methodical" purposeful for voice, no loops obscuring closure. Zero figurative muddle; propulsion aligns with scene cadence to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis: archival absence breeds literal doors resolved via rope grammar, transforming trope organically. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick; non-obvious final repricing ("absence...becomes a bridge") inevitable from particulars. Bold premise commitment, no hedging.</comment>
