<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shown in choosing quieter methods over shock, embodied in scarf-rubbing and shelving; final endurance of ongoing search earned with pocket-tide cost. Interiority concrete and particular, no stock phrasing. Voice specificity elevates to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds via curvature motifs to CR closure ("haven't found...but seen its weather") with conceptual cost in perpetual tide. Continuous scene, pattern taught early, no orientation debt. Persistent scarf constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Saddle-space and curving shelves constrain navigation choices; scarf as micro-setting charges wringing-to-snow image. Sensory details (ozone, saltier air) POV-filtered, evolve causally. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stories' origin) signaled early, tightens via map-unrolling cadence shift narrowing to endurance; agency in shelving-path choices under lens. Cost legible in tide retained post-return. Minor abstractness in peak but charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastline/endings motif shifts to weather-making currents, resonant non-literal answer in final waves without moralizing. Emerges organically from curvature struggle. Counter-readings (not found yet seen) embrace ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (punctuation as compass roses, theorems as lullabies) with rhythmic control; stable first-person, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/scaffold; figurative density pattern-taught via geometry without muddle in closure beat. Minor overwriting in mid-reflection but propels to snow-image payoff. Propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry in poetry-library stacks fresh synthesis, risk-taking in nonlinear navigation heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable premise transforms tropes; inevitable hindsight from particulars.</comment>
