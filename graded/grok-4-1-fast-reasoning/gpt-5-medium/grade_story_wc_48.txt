<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in refusal of market's "tidy raft," embodied in wading and shell's throb; contradictory impulses (patience vs. resolution-seeking) act in scene. Final choice to "arrange permission" earned with cost of foreclosing triumphs. Minor passivity in receiving emblems slightly undercuts micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cameos/emblems builds pattern, cadence shifts at "solemnize my pact" wading and final "I chose the river." Closure as CR in shell aligning with "secret spine," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of habit-resistance. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via mist's "pocket of visibility" suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Feral nexus vividly filters through POV (rust reeds, contrary river thread); shell as micro-setting constrains patience and charges final alignment. Sensory hierarchy (hush, chill articulate around knees) purposeful, evolves causally (mist thickens like ink). No white-room; setting guides wading choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect hopes' shapes vs. market) signaled early, tightens via wading/receiving emblems under textural lens, foreclosing tidy resolutions. Escalation in thickening mist and more figures narrows to "arranging permission"; cost legible in "dissolve entirely" threat and river-choice endurance. Quiet agency but coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of art's "shapes of different hopes" emerges organically from emblems and river refusal, no statements; final "pockets bright with offerings" reweights prior material non-literally. Complexity in ambiguity of cameos' "permission" lingers without morals. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (literary biases: "endings lean forward like listeners"); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation (short sentences in wading). Compression taught early via fragments pays off legibly at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (e.g., "page turned... silver rain"); metaphors consistent/pattern-taught (mist, shells) without muddle in peak wading beat. Minor figurative density risks overwriting but serves lyric mode without obscuring closure image. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh surreal nexus transforms writerly tropes (unwritten characters as cameos) into organic synthesis; risk-taking in lyric mosaic heightens stakes via emblem accumulation. Final doors' visions feel inevitable, non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
