<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between caution from losses and thrill of unknowns act simultaneously in the stack traversal; final integration of father's theorem into seminar notes earns change with felt cost of past drownings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scrawl patterns densify to lantern discovery (DC tightening) and bus finale (CR reweighting priors with cost of selective stewardship over theater).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rainwashed stacks and mica pane constrain traversal choices and lens rain drops as coins, charging final bus image where clover grief steams green.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to widen perspectives tightens via theorem's "practice risk as stewardship," forcing renunciation of pure caution with legible past-loss cost, though escalation remains reflective over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions as bridge emerges organically; final bus image non-literally reweights gambling as map without moral, embracing ambiguity of anecdotes vs. evidence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct probabilistic perceptual signature ("each drop a discrete coin") and rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure sustain single-POV coherence without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric figuratives ("rain teaches gutters to sing") varies rhythm without loops or muddle; propulsion clear through closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subway scrawls as probabilistic compass transforms gambler-daughter trope; risk-taking in mosaic reflections heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
