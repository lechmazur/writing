<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's lost smell roots motivation in concrete sensory shift, enabling micro-choices like guiding siphon breaths; customer's fear embodied in searching eyes and knuckles tremor compels earned unshouldering. Internal endurance of "trembling calm" layers contradiction without therapy-speak. Final calibration of clepsydra traces to prior mapping, foreclosing fear with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via drip patterns and fog thinning toward CR closure in "We are three" message, reweighting waiting with undeniable joy/cost from past "silence turned to iron." Orientation anchors in opening shop hush; one tightening via screw fit narrows fear to permission. Cost legible in cradling image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shop's basins and clepsydra constrain repair choice, charging final pulse; fogged glass and "shy percussion of every drip" mirror occluded emotional reads. Sensory hierarchy (droplets as "vowels") reflects POV bias. Recurring water evolves causally, culminating in recording's "water and laughter."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of labor anxiety signaled in hesitant entry, tightens accumulatively via past baby scare and repair breaths, forcing stance shift to "permission for time to be a body." Agency in screw provision and teaching forecloses iron silence path. Cost felt in tremor through metal/water/knuckles, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unveiling miracles emerges via particulars like screw's "exact small kindness," reweighted in birth message without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures (Rey's nod) invites ambiguity of fear/welcome. Final image answers "reading between lines" with laughter proof, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature ("map emotional terrain the way sailors listen to waves") biases noticing toward occluded cues; poetic rhythm modulates with intensity (short breaths in repair). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Will it hold"), advances via whispers. No head-hopping; elision of smell loss paid in water focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with drip cadence, high density in "condensed breath on the window, ripples in basins"; figurative pattern (water as speech) coherent, no muddle in peak repair. Minor synonym churn in "hush" echoes purposeful, not looped. Propulsion clear, no scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anosmia-to-water-empathy premise transforms clock repair into birth rite; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes via irreplaceable screw fit. No template echoes; particulars like "midwife's birthing clamp screw" feel inevitable, charging close.</comment>
