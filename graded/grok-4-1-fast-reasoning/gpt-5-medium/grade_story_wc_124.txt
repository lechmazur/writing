<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in opening vial despite buckling fear, earning shift from trap to compass with embodied tears; interiority particular via scent/light metaphors. Flawless micro-choices under pressure, like angling lantern for bloom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lantern trade → UV on vial → inscription → bloom cadence reconfigures memory as "currents that shape present shores" with tear-cost. Orientation instant; single scene tightens perfectly to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains (unlock case, wait for bloom) and charges final image via "feathered vapor" mirroring vial; sensory hierarchy (scent primacy) POV-specific, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scent-memory tears) deepens texturally via UV reveal tying mother, forcing endurance till bloom; cost legible in "eyes sting with phantom" and collected drop, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memories scour/lay sand, resonant in bloom's "shadows inside brightness" reweighting premise without moral; vial-flower interplay avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/scent as "cooled music," "patient ink") modulates rhythmically; sparse dialogue subtextual ("brave about darkness"), stable first-person bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "petals unlock with disciplined lightning"); metaphors coherent/pattern-taught, no loops, though figurative density borders overwrite pre-climax without harming bloom payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: UV-scent-memory reveal in extinct greenhouse transforms tropes; bold lyric risks (e.g., "lanterns blooming along the stair") heighten stakes organically.</comment>
