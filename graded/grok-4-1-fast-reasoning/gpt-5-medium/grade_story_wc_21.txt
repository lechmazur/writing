<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via "breath a metronome" and grandmother's nudge forcing kelp signal; contradictory endurance in scalding reverie earns final half-trapped forward walk with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as debris patterns densify to reverie trap then loosen; Charged Poise closure at "surf reads them aloud with difficult tenderness... bridge that cannot be unbuilt" reconfigures history with half-trapped cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lagoon as obsidian eye constrains beach ritual and charges final "glints off the lagoon, that obsidian vow"; sensory bias (archivist maps marches in eelgrass) filters urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth ledger) signaled early tightens via signal-drawing clerk under lens; agency in parley/punches forecloses hidden past with scalding cost and half-trapped poise unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unsurrendered echoes emerges from debris-to-names arc; final "city learning to read itself aloud" non-literally reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("past begins writing back with a scorched whisper") modulates rhythm to charged poise; lyric compression taught early legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels but dense figures in reverie climax ("pens hover like gulls starving over a clean beach, then dive") slightly muddle propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zeppelin library over obsidian lagoon fuses surreal civil-rights reverie into inevitable synthesis; risk of mosaic shards heightens stakes without obscuring CR closure.</comment>
