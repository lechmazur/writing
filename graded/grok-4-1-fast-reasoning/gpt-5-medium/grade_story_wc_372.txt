<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through perceptual filters like "sampling frequencies of patterned sorrow"; final vow earned by escalating duty from clerk to guardian, with embodied cost in "birds wheeled into me, sewing light through the seams of my coat." Contradictory impulses between preservation and encroaching oblivion act in scene via hesitant measurements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light patterns builds to directive code, closing with Resonant Reconfiguration as library exhales and "constellations rearranged to a steadier grammar." Orientation anchored early in library/POV; fractured pledge incites causal chain to personal vow with felt cost of self-harvest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen library constrains isolation and choices, charging final image where "shelves settled" and beam opens corridors; icicles, frost, clouds tactile and POV-biased toward resonances. Recurring lantern slide guides action throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to bind vows against oblivion signaled early, escalates texturally via impossible values → birds/code → self-vow tightening; agency in mounting slide forecloses escape with cost of "vows harvested me," unmistakable in final refraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of anchoring vanishing emerges organically from measurements to vow; final image of rearranged constellations reweights promise/oblivion without moral, resonant via "hinge that would not corrode."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in frequency/hush diction, rhythmic control modulates from "glass screamed" to sheltering hush; stable first-person filters all, eliding backstory anchors present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm peaks in "snowbirds made from filaments of vows"; coherent metaphors like "icicles spelled alphabets" avoid muddle, no loops though minor descriptive density in aisles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival fantasy with light-vows and frequency measurements; risk in lyric accumulation transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight via library's self-directive.</comment>
