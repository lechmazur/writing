<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Therapist's micro-choices like peeling the clementine and calling the son reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, earning the reunion with relational cost; father and son's distinct voices and embodied flaws (shard as talisman, estrangement) drive inevitable reconciliation. Final endurance of presence by son confronts flaws with visible cost on page. Contradictory impulses act in scene (father's held breath as question), satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from therapist's arrival through songs and history to Charged Poise closure in "monitors loosen their grip, and the room holds the last note like a vow," with cost of death legible in thinning breaths and light as "gentle river finding the sea." Orientation anchored early (~50 words); single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring light on blanket ("pools... like water," final "gentle river finding the sea") constrains choices (visual music source) and charges final image, satisfying 9+ test; sensory hierarchy (beeps, clementine scent, linoleum squeak) reflects therapist's mundane-hymning bias. Spatial choreography clear throughout room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye via reunion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with son's arrival and shared verses narrowing time/options; agency in therapist's call and humming drives escalation, cost unmistakable in father's "tired" and thinning breaths. Satisfies 9+ test with on-page price charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of joy's sharp edges softened by hymning mundane emerges organically from shard, clementine, shared history verses; final image reweights shard from cut to carried hope without moral, satisfying 9+ test. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (mundane as music: "song of the window latch") stable in single POV; dialogue subtextual ("It stopped, but you can still dance") advances plot naturally with distinct idioms. Rhythmic control modulates to closure hush, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (lyric accumulative mode taught early) propels without loops; minor density of metaphors in peak reunion ("breathe into a shape," "climbing line") risks overwrite but coheres and pays off at closure. Zero artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hymning mundane transforms hospice deathbed reunion via shard/clementine synthesis into fresh frame; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes inevitably, with bold perceptual angle on stillness as pulse. Non-obvious moral calculus on memory's edge satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
