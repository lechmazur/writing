<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism-minded interiority shines in concrete micro-choices like "tilt my head instead, because paper burns and skulls endure pressure," earning the crown-wearing transformation with embodied vigilance; contradictory impulses in refusing familiar reaches propel higher stakes without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of perceptual layers builds to Charged Poise closure—"I leave with safes reopened in my ribs"—with legible cost in the hour's limit and final corridor choice between breaths; orientation anchors early in grotto entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto's syrup air, upward drips, and flexing chambers constrain choices like crown trials and safe stares, charging the final upside-down reentry image; sensory bias through archivist's prism filters evolves with inversion, mirroring internal refract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding combinations tightens via gaze-timing escalation on safes—"at the fortieth heartbeat the hinge sighs"—forcing trade-off in time-bound corridor choice; agency in attention forecloses haste with visible cost in hour's end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patience as architecture emerges from particulars like seeds scattered by noticing absences, reweighted in "steps ring, quietly scandalous" without moralizing; final image answers vigilance's quiet power over bullied locks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—"angles translating into gentle verdicts"—modulates rhythm with pressure, from syrup-narrowed sound to charged pollen dimming; purposeful poetic compression taught early remains legible to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax and purposeful metaphors like "drip that falls upward," coherent under prism pattern; no loops or scaffolds dull the closure's breathing map image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal inversion of gravity and gaze-combination locks transforms quest trope into archivist's parish of memory-naves; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via doodle-guided refract.</comment>
