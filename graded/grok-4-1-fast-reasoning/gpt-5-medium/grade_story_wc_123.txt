<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between curiosity and restraint act vividly in decoy charts vs. real pigeon message; final lateral step earns renunciation of direct confrontation with embodied cost in "the nurse in me bled no noise."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as weather patterns and subtle beats build to Charged Poise closure in protagonist's sideways evasion and window return, with cost legible in abandoned decoys and pigeon's flight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting constrains choices (bench for decoys, arch and fig for lateral escape) and charges final image; weather details like "pressure fell not forward, but sideways" filter through POV expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weather truth vs. quarantine control tightens accumulatively via pigeon exchange and figure confrontation, forcing agency in decoys/escape; cost felt in foreclosed direct approach during "You are not being hunted, only protected."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of integrity via lateral truths emerges organically from weather motifs shifting to "Integrity is a barometer too," offering resonant CR without statement; final image reweights institutional vs. personal maps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in weather-inflected diction ("barometric tremors braided with rumor") modulates rhythm under pressure; dialogue subtext sharp in figure's "leave the rest alone" evasion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful, coherent metaphors (weather vehicles consistent); rhythm varies propulsively, no loops dulling closure image of "the weather entered the ledger as it pleased."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-recording as resistance transforms quarantine trope; lateral progression and pigeon code feel inevitable from established patterns, with bold lyric risks heightening stakes.</comment>
