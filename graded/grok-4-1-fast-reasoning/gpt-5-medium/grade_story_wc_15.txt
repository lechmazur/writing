<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied actions like "hands learned meter from rope and salt"; contradictory optimism/stubbornness compels higher-stakes sewing of names into tether at chamber climax, earning communal change with cost of personal persistence. Final altar recitation reveals values hierarchy without epiphany. No label-speak flattens peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chalk paths to altar builds density toward Resonant Reconfiguration (sluices open after plate-printing and name-recitation). Orientation anchored in first lines (Sera post-tide pools to canyon). Closure cost legible in "leave the plate at the altar" foreclosing salvage-only path. Lens taught early via tether-knots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, rust-thyme breath, mirror water constrain choices (tether dots, plate in beak-socket); plate gulls charge final altar image, mirroring internal vows. Sensory hierarchy (fingertips read script) reflects weaver bias. No white-room; spatial choreography clear from wharf spire to bend.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remake precedents via ceremony) signaled early, tightens texturally through chamber nets-to-altar deepening, forcing trade-off (sew absence-names, leave plate). Agency in plate-pressing opens sluices with felt cost on harbor. Escalation coherent under lens; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ruin-to-reverence emerges from particulars (tethered names, printed gulls); final "wet exhale" reconfigures broken precedents without moralizing. Subtext in shadows pecking syllables invites ambiguity on optimism's price. No thematic echo; resonance from shared sleep-paths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rope now hums a measured prayer") biases toward weave/salt imagery; rhythmic syntax modulates from preparation to altar poise. Stable first-person with no leakage; compression purposeful in lyric mode, taught by opening meter-reference, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density ("metal sings against hemp") propels without loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent/voice-driven (gulls "leap to ceilings"), no muddle in peak altar beat. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no filter stacks dull chamber tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic labyrinth via communal sleep-paths and sewn ceremony transforms tropes; risky poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at sluice-opening. No derivative echoes; bold weaver-POV inflects ruin-reverence organically.</comment>
