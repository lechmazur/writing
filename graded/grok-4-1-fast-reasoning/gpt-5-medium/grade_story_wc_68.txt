<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses shine in the "old ache" reflex to lie versus leveraging the cog for action, earning the final renunciation of arson-rebellion with embodied cost. Traits like rational rebellion consistently drive micro-choices, from rinsing the cog to wedging it precisely. Secondary characters apply targeted pressure without diluting POV coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds to causal closure via RR (Charged Poise): cog wedges sluice as "thought snapping into place," reconfiguring narratives with legible cost in "pressure kissed our shins." Orientation anchors immediately in sewer ruins post-plague; single scene with reflective shards holds tightly. One deepening—imminent silt jam—forces trade-off without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silt humps "like sleeping whales" and chalked flood marks constrain the path to crisis, charging the final wheel-turn image. Sensory selection (algae prints, salt-bright ink) filters through POV's method-hunting bias, mirroring internal stubborn arithmetic. Micro-setting via cog-as-tool enables clutch save, evolving causally with flood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cog as method vs. narrative demands—tightens via noon tide jam, forcing narrator's agency to lead and wedge cog, foreclosing parade/lie option. Escalation under hybrid lens: density to situational pressure culminates in shins-kissed cost, reweighting options undeniably. Moral calculus between competing goods (save cog, save quarters) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of methods over narratives emerges implicitly from particulars: past tide clock save, cog fixing sluice as "old method stood up...without asking permission." Final image dampens slogans organically, offering resonant answer to certainty-as-disease without moralizing. Subtext in silences post-save invites lingering ambiguity on rebellion's quiet wins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abrasive-calm voice delivers distinct perceptual signature ("scream has already happened," "stubborn arithmetic") modulating rhythmically to peak compression in sluice scene. Stable first-person focalization biases toward silt-seeds; purposeful elision of visitor dialogue heightens implication. Prose syntax reflects philosopher's precise mind under flood stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms (short punchy climaxes amid lyric builds); metaphors cohere (cog as "tooth from time," "lever not pose") without muddle. Zero loops or scaffolds; every line multi-tasks, e.g., "water came exactly on my chalk" advances causality, stakes, proof. Read-aloud cadence peaks flawlessly in wheel-catch snap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague philosopher salvaging cog amid narrative wars transforms ruin-trope via tactile methods (barnacled gears, waterlines as rings). Risky poetic voice heightens stakes organically; cog's reprise feels inevitable, not gimmicked. Bold non-arson rebellion reweights premise inventively.</comment>
