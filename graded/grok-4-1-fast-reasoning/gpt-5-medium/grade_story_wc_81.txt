<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied perception like "the soft bruise of its weight" reveals character-specific suspicion; motivation intensifies via discoveries compelling higher-stakes testing. Micro-choices like stamping the margin show values hierarchy with cost of altered worldview. Minor lack of overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries layer density toward CR closure; orientation anchored early in first paragraph. "The city tilt in my mind" delivers legible before/after with conceptual cost of reweighted history. Single scene fits defaults, no shards or transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken library micro-setting constrains via blackout silencing hum, enabling truer perception; recurring stacks and ducts evolve tactilely. Body/tool integration: stamp's pearwood feathers cracks, charging discoveries. Final "stillness...clung to the spines" recharges environment in closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing origins) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing rehearsed truths. Agency in stamping forces trade-offs, culminating in hiding stamp with felt cost of isolation from doctrine. One tightening sufficient; band entry via option foreclosure in journal margin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of honest origins vs. rehearsal emerges organically from particulars like redacted minutes and registrar's margin note. Final image of hiding stamp near "words that understood its weight" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting flood premise. Ambiguity lingers plausibly in lowered city's implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("pages dry like leaves in a careful wind") biases toward logical suspicion; rhythmic modulation heightens under blackout pressure. Stable POV with lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors coherent via breathing/water pattern without muddle. Minor overwriting in stacked figures during discoveries (−0.4), but no loops or scaffolds obscure cause/effect. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken library indexer using pearwood stamp transforms flood trope via alternative hypothesis mechanic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; "lowered, not lost" turn inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
