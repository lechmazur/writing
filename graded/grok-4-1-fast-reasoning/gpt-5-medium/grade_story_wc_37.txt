<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scattered self gathers through concrete micro-choices like harvesting lullabies and splicing chants, with embodied flaws ("courage fluttered like burlap") driving internal conflict to earned tightening ("fewer pieces falling"). Final nod with twin shares scars as credible endurance with cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of braided voices builds to Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("light tied to dark, both permitted to breathe"), with conceptual cost legible in "share scars" and "bound release." Orientation anchored early; single scene progression tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mica window as recurrent object evolves to loom, constraining weaving choice and charging final image ("mica window becomes a covenant"). Sensory details (wet stars, sticky laughter) selective via POV, mirroring internal states through action; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle via woven dawns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening realization ("weave across both sides"), narrowing options with agency in threading voices; cost felt in "exchanging debts for harmonies." One tightening sufficient, charges closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of bound release emerges organically from particulars like swaddling grafts and shared scars, reweighting premise in final image ("swaddle itself in what it feared to lose") without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to communal rekindling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "trees distilled regrets into fruit") modulates rhythm under pressure; stable POV, purposeful compression taught early, no head-hopping; 9+ rhythmic control intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful weaving metaphors consistent across beats, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density in peak weaving risks slight coherence dip but pattern-taught, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical orchard and mirror-weaving transforms tropes organically; bold mirror-twin risk heightens stakes in cross-loom climax, inevitable in hindsight. Non-obvious conceptual integrity elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
