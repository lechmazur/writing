<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to decode buildings drives persistent micro-choices like borrowing sugar and pressing the seal; tutor's patient rituals reveal character through action. Internal conflict emerges in hesitation to "interrogate" before the pivotal question. Earned closure choice to take seal forecloses casual listening with commitment cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from stairwell syntax to roof revelation; one tightening at "Are you dead?" narrows to seal's CR with conceptual cost of holding illusions. Orientation anchored early in building move-in. Closure reconfigures premise: buildings store human weather.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and meteor shower constrain final ritual, charging seal impression; stairwell drafts, pipes, and mortar evolve tactilely through listening actions. Sensory details (breaths, groans) mirror internal states purposefully. Recurring ivy crest on seal recharges as micro-setting in climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn building language) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to tutor's plea; agency in questioning and seal-pressing forecloses truth-cruelty path. Visible cost: commitment amid building's "full of rain." Escalation coheres under textural lens with meteor-thickened density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of respectfully held illusions emerges from seal's sentences and tutor's request, reweighting lies as shelter ethics. Final image (sky finishes speaking) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in silences and rituals avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature equates buildings to syntax/breaths; rhythmic prose modulates from gentle ellipses to charged dusk address. Sparse dialogue carries subtext (e.g., "Only as much as the Latin in the cornice"). Stable first-person POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "steam turns to rain") taught early as building voice, no muddle in roof peak. Varied rhythm propels from tea calm to meteor shiver. Zero loops; precise syntax supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted building as lie-keeper with seal's revelations transforms ghost trope via linguistic ethics. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
