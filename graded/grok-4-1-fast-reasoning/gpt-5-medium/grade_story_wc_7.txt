<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied tastes like "spit the taste onto the soil like a confession" reveal contradictory impulses (personal memory vs. communal sharing), earning the final gathering with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as tastes prune memories toward charged poise in soup-sharing; celestial alignment's "tightest knot" delivers RR closure with rebellion's felt cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains clearing/planting and evolves to host gathering, charging final image; tastes filter sensory hierarchy through chef's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pruning's bitter saps ("unfinished homework") deepen stake under accumulative lens, narrowing to communal trade-off; council ordinance adds moral cost legible in sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Soup's "color of old copper, studded with the city we refuse to discard" resonantly answers ruins-to-beauty, reweighting memories without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Taste perceptions ("river stones warmed by sun") forge distinct signature; stable first-person POV biases toward flavors, modulating rhythmically under alignment pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies propulsion to closure ("We began rebuilding with flavors"); figurative density purposeful in burst ("bark veined with copper"), no loops dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Memory-tasting via synaptic plasticity synthesizes ruins/rebellion into inevitable communal fruit, risking poetic compression that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
