<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's accidentally prophetic trait shown concretely via fisherman smuggling example, compelling higher-stakes orchestration choice; interiority particular (punchlines lived among) with contradictory impulses in passive directing vs. bold projection. Keeper applies crucible pressure via dialogue ("orchestrating the weather"). Final ledger fortune earns change with cost (town's wet shoes squeaking).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of secrets/patterns builds to lighthouse projection as CR, reweighting town with "You already know" unfolding (cost: admissions ricochet, agent blank). Two shards (harbor-lighthouse) transition legibly; orientation anchored in first paragraph (harbor, tray, envelope).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens constrains choice (pivoted to scatter fortunes town-wide), charging final image (sticky hands watching); sensory vivid/POV-biased (salt-white boots, ember hair, tide thinking). Spatial choreography coherent (causeway to door).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transpose via open secrets) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to public projection narrowing hide/reveal options; agency in boiling/inking/feeding machine, cost legible ("night unfolded... everyone finally looked"; agent fooled).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets as mercy emerges organically via projection image ("smug, but mercy"); final "see what you have done" reweights orchestration without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer to transposing key.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (tides thinking, gulls crosswind) modulates rhythm under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Got your fortune"; "orchestrating the weather"). Stable POV, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy finals like "I listened"); metaphors consistent/patterned (light/tide/music) without muddle in peak (projection beat). No loops/artifacts; propulsion weaves image/action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune microdots projected town-wide via lighthouse transforms spy tropes into textural orchestration; risk of poetic density heightens stakes, inevitable in "lighthouse tell them what they had been saying."</comment>
