<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "hands remember restraint" vs. tracking knowledge, compelling micro-choices like sheathing knives; endurance of pacifism earns closure with father's absence as felt cost. Visitors apply pressure but remain slightly generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to trio's transformation and father's note; closure as Charged Poise in "farm becomes a hinge... turning ruin toward renewal" lands with conceptual cost of ongoing separation. Orientation anchored early in dome/farm post-tower.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome and roses constrain choices ("stall at the thresholds of roses") and charge final trellis image; sensory selection (dust scrawls, spines like sundials) filters through pacifist bias, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of continuity vs. blame tightens via trio's arrival and name-planting, forcing agency in mercy; cost legible in knife-softening and knife sheathed "with cloth and soil," reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mercy-over-blame emerges organically from roses/scrap/letter; final trellis tying offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting chaos with continuity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("engraved quiet hums back through their wrists") and rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early, paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but minor overwriting in thorn/sundial metaphor cluster slightly muddles a mid-beat; no loops, clear propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inculcating plants with values transforms post-tower tropes; risk in lyric pacifism heightens stakes, inevitable in trellis closure.</comment>
