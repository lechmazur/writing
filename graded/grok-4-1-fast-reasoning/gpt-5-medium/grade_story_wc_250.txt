<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction and embodied emotion culminate in earned change: narrator's withheld secret spills after mirror handoff, foreclosing shame with felt cost in "door in my chest lift and breathe." Guardian's micro-choices reveal flaws and values under relational pressure. Minor backstory block anchors present without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from observation to participation in light-weaving, knots, secret-sharing; Charged Poise closure reconfigures with mirror as persistent constraint and cost legible in brother's "refusing the old pull." Orientation anchored early at cobalt dock; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dock, canal, shutters constrain choices (light paths, patterns) and charge final image of "water kept the lesson." Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (tar/nettle smell, canal mouthing); weather (rain) evolves causally. Micro-setting (bollard, piling) tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach darkness stars' value) signaled early, deepens via agency in angling mirror toward "drowned arches," forcing brother's shimmer-refusal; cost unmistakable in shame retreat and voice return as "floodwater." Accumulative cadence shift reweights without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silent light against grief emerges organically from particulars; final mirror-cupped departure offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting brother's darkness without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (circle gesture, mirror on palms) layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (synesthetic images like "rainbows of oil") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates with intensity, compression under stress purposeful and taught. Stable first-person; no dialogue to judge, internal voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative density in peak beats ("shame tried retreating") borders overwriting without muddle; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Opening anchors stakes poetically; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guardian's light-weaving transforms silence/grief tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from early mirror seed to "small star I would use." Bold voice commits fully.</comment>
