<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like aligning the flower to the notch, reveal a consistent eccentric trait rooted in persistence; borrowed memories anchor motivation without unearned epiphanies. Internal conflict emerges subtly in weighing isolation's "careful temperature," earning the final endurance. Lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered discoveries (notch, scratches, memory) tightening to Charged Poise closure: lantern swing elicits reply, sweeping hides the notch with legible cost in "witnessed isolation." Orientation anchored early in "nautical twilight the dock." No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dock planks and notch constrain investigation (stems "settled perfectly"), charging final image of swept "aging flaw"; mist and twilight selectively narrow perception to tactile gaps. Sensory hierarchy reflects keeper's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode gesture deepens via memory revelation, narrowing to lantern signal with agency and felt cost in "accounting I had agreed to keep." Accumulative escalation reweights isolation's pressure coherently. Minor abstractness in stakes before notch discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of signals across gaps emerges organically from particulars (girl's knocks, inverted taps), culminating in resonant final image: "holds the flower and the light like a promise that can be borrowed but not owned," reweighting borrowed memories without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "observing gaps" and rhythmic lyricism modulate with intensity; stable first-person POV with no leakage. Voice as character: syntax reflects persistent mind, e.g., "the tide keeps its own ledger of names."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; figurative language consistent and pattern-taught (opals, gaps, ledgers) without muddle, varying rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor density dip in reflective block ("witnessed isolation has a weight") but no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse trope with dock's "borrowed memories" and Edelweiss code transforms isolation into charged poise; risk in poetic voice heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from gaps motif to swept ledger.</comment>
