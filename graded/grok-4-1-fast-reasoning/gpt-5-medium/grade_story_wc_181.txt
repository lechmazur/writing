<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (disquiet drawing him to grove) act in scene; final resolute smile earned by causal chain of cameo presses and fruit-eating, with cost of being rewritten/claimed. Interiority concrete via cameo ticking and hands shaking. No unearned epiphanies; aunt's inheritance compels higher stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (orchard fruits as pages) builds to CR closure where cameo impression forecloses return path with orchard's claim as conceptual cost ("the orchard would claim them"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Nonlinear pattern taught early via rules, legible at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring cameo and silver pod constrain choices (pod for breakthrough cueing grove; cameo grafts likeness). Sensory hierarchy (tide in seashell, pit clicking teeth) reflects curator's priorities. Final pod gleam charges image under lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge) signaled early, deepens via tree's lineage rule narrowing to cameo press; agency in choosing dull fruit forces flood of aunt's archive. Escalation accumulates texturally to stance crystallization with cost ("history not his rummaged through his bones").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance emerges implicitly from fruit visions and cameo grafting; final image ("pages that keep writing us") reweights premise without moral, embracing inquiry's complicity cost. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in unfinished face.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (bathroom epiphanies, objects hungry) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in grove ("lines rose upon it like veins"). Stable single-POV; whisper/subtext in tree/aunt advances without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "brightened disquiet like a lantern raised within fog") propels without loops or muddle; varied syntax breathes with pressure, no scaffolds. Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully; closure image ("silver pod gleamed") clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchards as nonlinear ledgers transforms inheritance tropes; cameo as hungry object risks bold payoff in grafting, heightening stakes via rule ("ask with your lineage"). Inevitable hindsight from early pattern.</comment>
