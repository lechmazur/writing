<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and particular through perceptual bias toward laughter as bridge, with embodied emotion in "modestly fearless breath" and micro-choices like humming counter-melody. Flawless motivation roots in consistent traits, compelling the key endurance of standing aside at closure. Minor slip: spectral woman's arc feels slightly archetypal without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of voices builds to cadence shift in woman's release, landing Charged Poise RR with legible cost in "I stood aside, as my work requires." Orientation anchored early in arrival at gorge. One tightening via hesitant voice suffices; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gorge's limestone cleft, wind-tuned harp, and subsurface river constrain choices (plucking elicits confessions) and charge final image (leaves string for wind). Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective: sound-dominant with "trembling like light on oil," tactile tooth on wall. Micro-setting (harp, tooth) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax laughter for healing) signaled early, tightens texturally via woman's mid-laughter death fear, forcing tactic shift to "crooked chuckle." Agency in plucking and secret-sharing forecloses her betrayal path with on-page cost. Escalation coheres under lens; minor abstractness in stakes pre-woman slightly softens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of laughter yielding sorrow's smile emerges organically from particulars like "old joke about the moon misplacing her spectacles," reweighting in braided release without statement. Final image offers non-literal resonance to healing question. No moralizing; ambiguity in narrator's aside invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature: idiosyncratic metaphors ("laughter grew legs") and rhythmic modulation build intensity. POV stable, bias toward musical decay legible. Voice prose-as-character reflects "gardener of untended laughter" mind; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "plucked the first broken chord, the gorge answered"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in simile stacks ("light on oil," "wet with morning") during build but purposeful lyric pattern taught early, not obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: soul-collecting via misaligned harp laughter transforms ghost tropes into textural mercy quest, with tooth's midwife croc reweighting survival. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight via gorge-river braid.</comment>
