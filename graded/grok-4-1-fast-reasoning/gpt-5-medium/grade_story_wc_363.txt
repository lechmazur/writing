<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in longing intensifies through micro-choices like threading hair and puzzle edges, earning the thinning sacrifice at closure. Interiority concrete via embodied actions (barefoot heel tap) and perceptual biases (tasting wind). No strong simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from threading to fabric's drift, RR closure in loom emptying with "debt paid in quiet" as felt conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early in orchard/loom. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bamboo shafts and orchard hush constrain weaving (warp lines, drift path) and charge final "orchard breathed." Sensory selection (cicadas' refusal, wind as cloth thinking) POV-biased and purposeful. Micro-setting (loom, amber) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message across distance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via weave passes narrowing to launch with agency in recommencing. Cost legible in "thinning herself" and empty loom foreclosing self. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-bridge emerges organically from particulars (memories woven, fabric's breath), resonant non-literal answer in brother's knowing receipt reweighting isolation without moral. Ambiguity lingers in quiet stilled wait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (leaves' tremor measuring possibilities, hush tugging hems). Rhythmic prose modulates to incantatory weave beats. No dialogue; elision purposeful in lyric compression, paid at drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative overload in climax ("constellated oath binding silence") borders coherence strain without obscuring closure. No loops; purposeful motif recurrence (raveling hush). Propulsion clear in shuttle clicks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of loom/jigsaw/amber transforms separation trope into tactile sending, inevitable hindsight from bamboo fiber origins. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes in thinning cost without gimmick.</comment>
