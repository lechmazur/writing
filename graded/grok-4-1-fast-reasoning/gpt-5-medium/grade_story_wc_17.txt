<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between faithful mapping and shirking legacy act in scene via playing the dust hopscotch, earning final endurance with embodied cost of the "shawl woven from echoes."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory densities (diaries to negative to letter) culminate in CR closure of mapping as "school for hearing," with conceptual cost of walls' consent legible in house rising on "stilts of memory."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and walls constrain choices (ivy leads entry, ear to wall reveals dreams) and charge final image of thresholds asking questions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping dreams deepens via negative's glimpse and room-playing reversal, narrowing to legacy burden with agency in sketching "rhythm into ledger"; cost unmistakable in settling shawl.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of charting "future footfalls" resonantly reweights listening-to-ruins premise without moral, tying protagonist arc to forgiveness amid decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt grammar of vanished tenants," "click of cooling brick") modulates rhythm under pressure, with lyric compression taught early and stable first-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax (e.g., "I knelt and pressed my ear to the wall, and my name slid away like a coin down a tide drain"); no loops, purposeful figurative pattern enhances closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo cartography in drowned city transforms post-climate tropes; risk-taking in perceptual mapping heightens stakes, inevitable in "citizenship earned by attending to the walls."</comment>
