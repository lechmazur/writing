<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in carving the knot into a scar versus erasing it, earning final endurance of absence; micro-choices like thumb on notch reveal values under grief's pressure. Interiority particular via tiger uncles and patient wood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds carving/reflection to Charged Poise closure in "new ring" image, cost legible in "cages...dismantling...inside her ribcage." Orientation anchored in opening line; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rain beads as "little lenses" constrain pause and charge final image, mirroring internal patience; loft ropes/tins/kettle tactile and lived-in, filtering through widow's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of containing grief tightens accumulatively via knot pause to speaking ritual, agency in renunciation foreclosing perfection; cost felt in "refusing to name" miracles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of miracles in unhurried trust emerges via carving/notch; final bundle offers resonant answer to "teach me the hinge" without moralizing, reweighting loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "tigers blink like old uncles" and rhythmic modulation (short sentences at whistle bloom); stable close third-person POV biases toward practical hauntings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("steam ropes the air") integrated into action; varied rhythm propels without loops, read-aloud ear perfect in rain's silver music.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus ritual into carving endurance transforms tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in "traffics in miracles, by refusing to name them."</comment>
