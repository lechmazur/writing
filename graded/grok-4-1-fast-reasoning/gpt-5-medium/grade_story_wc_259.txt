<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied doubt ("refusal felt like a smaller betrayal") and contradictory impulses (climb despite warnings), earning final endurance of teaching over publishing; minor epiphanic tint at visions but prior causality intact. Child's pressure reveals narrator's values. 9+ test passed: impulses act in scene, closure choice earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early (dust spirals, rearrangement) holds to CR closure ("altered, which is the only honest theft"), with density tightening via child/compass/litany; cost legible in "we could not steal" line. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring pagoda/compass constrain choices (sideways stairs invite doubt; compass directs pulse) and charge final image (teaches carrying questions); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (historian notes hexagrams, alphabets). Micro-setting via body/fingertips dyes evolution perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge pursuit) signaled early, textural escalation via pattern-avoidance deepening to visions' anguished joy; agency in refusals/litania forecloses paths with alteration cost. Protagonist-driven under lens, undeniable price at chamber.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of responsible love via forbidden knowledge emerges organically from visions/particulars (queen buys humility, calendars from crumbs), resonant CR in final teaching image reweighting premise without moral; no sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("twilight here was a verb") modulates rhythm under pressure; dialogue sparse but subtextual (child's "teach me to forget with fidelity" advances stakes). Stable first-person, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (taught early, coherent at visions); rhythm varies (short warnings vs. litany cascade), no loops/artifacts. Minor density overload in pagoda ascent but propels to chamber payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bold surreal synthesis (archive as permissions via pattern-avoidance) transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric ascent heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via compass/teaching closure.</comment>
