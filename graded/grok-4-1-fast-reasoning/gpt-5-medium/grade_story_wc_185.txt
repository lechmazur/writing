<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "ribs clatter like thin cups" and micro-choices like tapping the stone reveal values, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; endurance of tending bloom feels earned with visible competence balanced by beings' pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure in "bloom of hush" petal widening then closing, cost legible in "stone grew cooler" and softened cracks; orientation anchored early in caves post-arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice fissures and echo stone as micro-settings constrain choices like aligning to flow and charge final image of stone warm to pulse; sensory hierarchy (sounds, tastes) reflects mapkeeper's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quiet in storm signaled early tightens via planting hush under lens, agency in breathing with corridor forecloses chaos path with cost in clattering ribs and rounded scripts; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of abundance learning quiet emerges organically from hush bloom events, final image of beings combing with gentler syllables offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting arrival premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fissures were shy hieroglyphs" biases noticing, rhythmic poetic syntax modulates with hush's bloom; stable first-person POV with no leakage, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in varied rhythm, but figurative density ("singing a weather," "blue to the tongue") borders overwriting in planting beat without full pattern payoff, minor loops in "gently luminous."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of energy beings and hush bloom transforms sci-fant tropes through mapkeeper's tactile world; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens closure's conceptual repricing of beings' permanence.</comment>
