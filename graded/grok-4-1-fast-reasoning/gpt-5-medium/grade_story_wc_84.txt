<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pilot's sharp-eyed noticing and micro-choices (adjusting algorithm for silences) earn the final calibration for kindness; pilgrim's surprise trait forces tender relational shifts. Contradictory impulses in confessing "talent is not finding, but noticing" reveal flaws under pressure. Closure change feels motivated by embodied progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of glyphs, blanks-as-rests culminates in Charged Poise closure where "belonging is not found but tuned" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost in the invitation's cadence. Single scene oriented early; no ambiguity. Final printout line seals legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dome, drones, and targeting stones constrain choices (pulling rope, lowering beams) and charge final spiral image. Dusk's "brilliant dimness" filters through pilot's perceptual bias, mirroring internal tuning. Recurrent star trails evolve causally with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early tightens accumulatively via algorithm shift reading silence as letter, forcing agency that narrows to resonant invitation. Cost legible in "patient appetite" of blanks and foreclosed "vowels of home." Protagonist endurance shapes closure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of tuned belonging emerges from particulars (blanks as rests, star trails as sentences), reweighting via final image of horizon speaking back without moralizing. Subtext in pilgrim's wince and pilot's confession layers ambiguity. Resonant non-literal answer in printout directive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice ("letters and orbits were relatives who stopped using last names") with perceptual signature persists under pressure; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("who I belong to"). Stable first-person, rhythmic modulation peaks in closure spiral.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through lyric metaphors that cohere and pay off (e.g., "tremor into script"); minor figurative density in revelation beat doesn't obscure. No loops or scaffolds; purposeful repetition like "perpetually surprised" taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drones, type chip, and observatory transforms belonging trope into tuned frequency via star trails. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes organically; final drone spiral feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
