<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied retrocognition drive micro-choices like cupping the shard; motivation to prove coincidences intensifies credibly through Lio's arrival. Minor abstraction in emotional progression ("coincidence as stitch") slightly distances peak embodiment without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to shard-prism repair and beam's exhale as Charged Poise RR; orientation anchored early in pavilion/saltlands. Traveler's map tightens causality without coincidence resolving; cost legible in ongoing recalculations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (humming ribs, hush shard cooling palm) constrains tuning and charges final beam image; POV filters post-collapse decay purposefully. Pavilion's glass stringers and etched stars evolve with action, mirroring internal states subtly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle/prove meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via map match and shard insight narrowing options; agency in trimming shard forces trade-off. Cost felt in Lio's scars and "sky had shifted" endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coincidences as choreography emerges organically from particulars like etched stars matching dreams; final "purpose click into place" reweights premise resonantly without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (hearing "yesterday breathing") and rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable first-person with clean focalization. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("both asks met").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel (e.g., "exhaled like a sleeper releasing a dream"); figurative language dense but consistent/voice-motivated, no loops or muddle touching closure. Minor paraphrase on "coincidence" in reflection blocks contained by BRR.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc lyricism with retrocog hush-shard repairing fractured light; transforms tropes via "thistle-blown hope" and pavilion diary. Risky poetic compression pays off in inevitable closure.</comment>
