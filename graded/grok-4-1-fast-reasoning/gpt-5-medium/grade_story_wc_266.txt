<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to find courage intensifies through embodied fear ("afraid of going the wrong way") and micro-choices (choosing fear-like bends), culminating in earned reach; guides apply gentle pressure without overshadowing interior conflict. Internal contradictions act in scene via hesitation amid forward nudge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from vigil to ridge traversal, tightening to RR closure ("I finally reach... skiff nest inside my chest") where internalizing courage reconfigures external search with felt cost of prior leashed life legible in hummed stories. Orientation anchored early in bay twilight; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and fog constrain choices (indirect routes, bends resembling fear) and charge final image; sensory selection (sand clicks, light on gulls) reflects POV urgency, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding courage) signaled early, escalates texturally via guide lessons and bend choices narrowing fear options, agency in reach foreclosing hesitation with on-page cost (leash refusal echoed). Pressure coheres to charged poise at shimmer grasp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of internal courage emerges organically from particulars (leash to skiff-in-chest), final image reweights external vigil as beside/within without moralizing; ambiguity in "indirect routes" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (noticing eddies, star warming) modulates rhythm under pressure; stable first-person, purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image; dialogue sparse, natural, subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent in lyric pattern (taught opening, payoff ridge/end); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion. Minor figurative density in traversal beat borders overwriting but supports textural lens without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic ferry quest internalized via poetic ridge/skiff, risk-taking in textural lyric heightens stakes; irreplaceable particulars (star-map palm, ankle shimmer) transform trope organically.</comment>
