<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iri's motivation to preserve wonder drives micro-choices like salting bells and nudging the shard, with embodied tremble in gloved fingers revealing restrained force; contradictory fears (wonder hardening vs. truth dissolving) act simultaneously without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to Keepers' arrival and symphonic revelation; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in their "new slowness" and Iri's day-tuning, with conceptual cost of unarchived wonder legible in departing bow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bluff, sculptures, and iceberg constrain choices (wind-tuned ledger, sun angle for glisten); recurring shard charges final cradle in ropes, mirroring internal states through tactile handling like "salted the bell lips with powdered ice."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder vs. archival hardening) signaled early, escalates texturally via pilgrim postures to Keeper confrontation and deepening symphonic turn narrowing options; agency in shard-nudge forces their stance crystallization with felt cost in wept learning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonant wonder over scuffed words emerges organically from tuning acts and Keeper transformation; final "tuned the day the way some water tunes stone" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-silence bias (e.g., "bells inhaled," "ringing settled"); stable third-close POV modulates rhythm with intensity, compression taught early via poetic elision paying off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light poured through and shattered into slow rain" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught without muddle or loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mute tuner guarding glacial "cold heart" against inked Keepers transforms silence/wonder trope; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via symphonic pivot.</comment>
