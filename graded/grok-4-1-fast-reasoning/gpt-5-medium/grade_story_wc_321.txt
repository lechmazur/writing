<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Deckhand's contradictory impulses—fatigue with lost arrivals yet resilient positivity—act simultaneously in radio tuning against captain's order and broom-tracing choice, earning final door selection with visible cost of accepting undertow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from radio voices to pattern alignment in grotto, landing Charged Poise RR closure ("bow kissed the threshold...promises mean little without their undertow") with legible conceptual cost of chosen transience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's dripping letters and mirrored stars constrain alignment choice and charge final emergence image, with surreal sensory details (varnish-still water, constellation scrapes) filtered through deckhand's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize arrivals via timeline merge) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven pattern-click ("traced broom bristles...loops that matched our wake") narrowing options to doors, with cost in tide-retention trade-off unmistakable at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of permanence-in-transience emerges organically from wake-lattices and door choice, final image ("sweeping dew where each footprint finally agreed to stay") offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior unreliability without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct surreal perceptual signature ("bulkheads hum like a beehive of calendars") biases noticing toward time-river motifs, rhythmic control heightens pressure in grotto without head-hopping or distance slips; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm ("sound bent, and the radio broadcast silence shaped like doors"); surreal figures consistent/pattern-taught from opening, no loops or muddle even in peak grotto beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal ferry-mythos with timeline lattices transforms tropes (lost arrivals) via broom-pattern risks that heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight with bold voice committing to premise without retreat.</comment>
