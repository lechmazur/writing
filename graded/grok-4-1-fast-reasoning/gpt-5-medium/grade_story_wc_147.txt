<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between panic ("panic paddles my ribs") and stillness act simultaneously in the corridor and surge beats, earning the final override and vial-corking with felt cost in overridden instinct. Interiority particular via sister-lilac memories tilting present choices. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing; flaws like instinctual flailing complicate under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from silt-panic to hush-coalescence to signal-thrum, with Charged Poise closure in "the line sings... thrums with an answer" reconfiguring rescue options. Orientation anchored early in trench-skiff-submersible setup. Persistent constraint of line-drag and time-gauge shapes tactics; cost legible in "fragile relief" post-unsnarl and final stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Temple micro-setting constrains pivotal choices: "stone teeth scrape my tank" forces stillness override, "surge swarms the doorway" tests final poise; vial-as-body-extension charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile cold/numbness, acoustic hush, visual silt-bruise under urgency. Details evolve causally (silt settles, anemones blink) without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crew rescue via hush-signal) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via corridor narrowing, unsnarl relief, vial-prayer, surge—each density shift narrows to stillness-tradeoff. Agency in micro-choices (nestle transmitter, exhale tones) drives tightening; cost unmistakable in "gauge needles inch toward warning" and bodily override.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral-harnessed-for-salvation emerges via vial-hush braid shifting from memory-touches to signal-song, reweighting premise in final "rescue was coaxed from what refuses to be held" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars: lilac goodbye evokes crew/sister crucible. Counter-reading ambiguity in myth-temple lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic bias fuses scent/sound/memory ("perfume to sing the mathematics of need"). Rhythmic control modulates—short bursts in panic ("panic paddles my ribs"), elongating hush-gathers to charged poise. Stable first-person focalization; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-job (e.g., "vial fills with nothing, and yet that nothing carries a soundless bouquet" advances action/atmosphere/theme). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite lyric density—figuratives cohere in voice-motivated pattern. Zero artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustics/perfume/memories transforms distress-signal trope into hush-prayer via vial's "peculiar gravity," inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in synesthetic hush-signal pays off charging closure without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; premise commits to underwater-ephemeral logic fully.</comment>
