<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in doubts as moths; final shift to "patient caretaker of questions" earned by keystone micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase at light spill and pattern break in keystone removal; CR closure via ongoing refusal reconfigures options with cost in perpetual climbs, legible in final sky smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "fog braided up the risers" and breathing notch constrain mist walking and keystone insertion; spire charges final unstrapping image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake resists automation signaled early; tightening at light's forehead tilt deepens with narrowing to renunciation, cost felt in hush glove for ordinary work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacred simplicity emerges organically from light/keystone particulars; resonant CR in street table and night climb answers without stating, reweighting underachievement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of "refusals" and pauses; rhythmic control modulates with pressure, stable first-person compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like platform "flexes like a sail"; no loops, propulsion varies rhythmically, minor fig density in peak contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mage vs. automated imagination transforms tropes via keystone "joke into gravity"; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in refusal cycle.</comment>
