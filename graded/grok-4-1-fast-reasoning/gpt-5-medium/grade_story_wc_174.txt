<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in hands feeling like "tools for theft" amid prior ethics claims; micro-choices like offering the stick reveal values with relational cost at woman’s entry. Minor diagnostic slips in reflection ("reverse the gravity of the strings") avoid heavier penalty as embodied in drafting scene. Earned serenity at closure follows causal buildup without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oriented instantly in dome post-argument; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density to Charged Poise closure in "meteor hush made of listening," reconfiguring ethics with felt cost of no applause. One tightening via woman's entry and notes narrows options purposefully. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dome's "meteor hush purling" and scaffolding "ribs" constrain choices—hush "insisted," amplifies promise—charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (chalk footsteps, moths) reflects calligrapher's bias; micro-setting (vellum as "puddle of moon") integrates without stall. Object (stick) as setting evolves to steady falterers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling) signaled in argument hush; textural deepening via woman's "clean and windworn" sentences forces punchline reversal, charging poise with brittle-breath cost. Agency in stick-offer and scene-building forecloses glib satire path. Coheres under Accumulative lens without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from puppet reversal and stick-sharing, culminating in non-literal final hush that reweights power dynamics without moralizing. Recurring vellum/puppets shift meaning via concrete acts, not abstraction. Ambiguity lingers in "learned how to follow" without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct calligraphic perceptual signature ("letters came easily... for removing fingerprints") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from reflective to charged in woman's speech and performance build. Stable first-person with no leakage; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke that forgot its fire"); varied rhythm supports ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in sustained figuratives ("fish moving upstream") consistent with voice, no muddle at closure image. Zero artifacts touching end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puppet ethics via stick-prosthetic in dome transforms satire trope through lived reversal; risk in audience-cast swap heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from vellum-draft to thread-cutting. No derivative echoes.</comment>
