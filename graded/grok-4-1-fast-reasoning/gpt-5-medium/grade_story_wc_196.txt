<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in dust-reading habit revealing contradictory ache and hope; final addendum choice earned by prior file discoveries forecloses passive archiving with emotional cost of persistent heartbreak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns and button discoveries build density to resonant reconfiguration; closure cost legible in envelope/action reweighting "unknown" as corridor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust as micro-setting constrains box discovery and charges final settling-mote image; selective sensory details (fluorescents, talc-gray air) filter through archivist's hopeful bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of magnifying kindnesses deepens accumulatively via prints/counselor inference, forcing addendum agency; cost felt in heart's enduring ache amid reconfigured unknown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of whispering kindness emerges organically from button/dust particulars; final forehead-to-window image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting histories without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in dust-as-language diction/rhythm modulates ache to poise; stable first-person focalization biases noticing toward quiet motions charging closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion strong with varied syntax supporting lyric accumulation; minor early figurative density (e.g., cardboard coffin) doesn't obscure closure image of dust map.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust-pattern reading as interpretive method transforms archival trope into fresh breadcrumb quest; risk-taking lyric synthesis inevitable in hindsight via button-envelope payoff.</comment>
