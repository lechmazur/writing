<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's arc from numbness to thaw feels earned through embodied frost cracking during Neri/Rae's sparring; Neri and Rae distinctly complementary without stereotypes. Minor label-speak in "who had never met a mirror she could not forgive" slightly abstracts traits. Final joint choice reveals values hierarchy with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: training density builds to Charged Poise closure in joint custody announcement, reweighting custody stake with narrator's felt thaw cost. Orientation anchored early in dojo; one tightening via jar's vibration consent. No ambiguity at "the jar vibrated when Neri took fire and Rae took water."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo with clouds underfoot and statues rearranging constrains final jar-carrying test, charging closure image. Sensory selectivity (static in teeth, river stones taste) biases via narrator's post-ego-death perception. Micro-setting like umber tiles guides movement purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivifying jar to defeat numbness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through sparring to jar test reversal narrowing solo custody options. Protagonist agency in recorder role and shout-switched roles forces trade-off. Cost legible in "frost inside me drain"; minor abstractness in declared stakes early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites emerges organically from sparring circuit to joint custody, reweighting solo guardianship in final "alternating current" image without moralizing. River lesson from jar concretely anchors epiphany. Ambiguity in future-statues lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with perceptual signature (history rewriting as storm) modulates rhythmically; first-person stable, no head-hopping. Compression in night-jar talks taught early pays off legibly. Minor register elevation in "circuits of mutual charge" fits lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short final sentences charge closure); density high but "history rewrites itself" reprises thrice create minor loop in opening/mid. Metaphors coherent ("blade of attention slices through pretense") without muddle. Some overwriting in "clouds wrote and wiped the world below" risks propulsion in training beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Clone custody via dojo opposites transforms sci-fi tropes through lived training circuit; jar's taste/scent replies and role-switch vibration feel inevitable. Risky lyric history-rewriting frames fresh angle on identity. Bold synthesis heightens numbness stakes organically.</question>
