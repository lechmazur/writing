<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Heartbroken reaper's tenderness contradicts resolve in pivotal hand-shake during Shoreless naming, embodying internal conflict with earned endurance into "new corridor of work." Micro-choices like scythe-focus reveal values hierarchy under pressure. No unearned epiphanies; flaws drive gentle reaping's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cylinder whispers to crystallized fears, culminating in Charged Poise CR at Shoreless naming with conceptual cost of ongoing mapping. Orientation anchored in first lines; single scene coherent. Cost legible in "no triumph, only a new corridor."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dome, lens, and dusk light constrain choices—taping atlas, baring to sun, scythe-focus—charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (grit/whisper, chiming glass) reflects reaper's priorities. Evolving details (flashing diagrams) mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming Miren's fear) tightens via flickering figure to scythe-cut crystallization under accumulative lens, narrowing vagueness with agency-driven deepening. Cost unmistakable in shelved voice and endless dusk returns. Escalation coherent without reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming as "agreements, breath shared" emerges organically from particulars, reweighting sacrifice's echo in final harbor-smudge without moralizing. Shoreless wound-closure offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity of failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (echoes crystallizing, monsters aligning) biases toward intangible grief; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in peak crystallization without head-hopping. Voice reflects reaper's poetic intimacy consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts dull closure—"scythe answered with a thin, kind star" resolves image crisply. Figuratives cohere (light remembers, glass choir) without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper myth into fear-naming ritual via cylinders/atlas transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at harbor-tracing close. No derivative hedging.</comment>
