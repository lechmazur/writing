<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in "certificate made it illegal to remember" act simultaneously with urge to confront; final renunciation earned by embodied bitterness on fingertips, revealing value hierarchy without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as fragments layer to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in widow's tremble and protagonist's departure foreclosing direct claim, with label as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Containers constrain hiding and tracing (catwalks, stacks sleep); final crate placement charges repricing of erasure, sensory details (oily constellations, rust) filtered through memory sieve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory texture) deepens accumulatively via label to mechanic intel forcing confrontation; visible cost in her phone reach and clerk exit narrows options, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Erased histories emerge organically via certificate/label fragments; final label-as-verdict reweights premise without moral, lingering ambiguity in ledger vs truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes are sieves") and rhythmic prose ("clanks and low vowels") stable in single POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing via mechanic/widow exchanges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels layers; coherent metaphors (rope, palimpsest) purposeful, minor reflective density slips non-closure but no loops or artifacts dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bureaucratic ghost synthesizing port erasure and poison label feels inevitable; mosaic risk-taking heightens textural stakes, transforming tropes via nameless listener's bold poise.</comment>
