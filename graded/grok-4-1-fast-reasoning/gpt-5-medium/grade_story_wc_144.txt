<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blindness flaw drives struggle with genuine tradeoffs, embodied in "hears the change like a crack in chalk" and calling for more bowls; micro-choices like threading copper braid and midair code patch earn endurance at closure with felt precision cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to fog-thickened crisis ("swallowing a lantern"), delivering Charged Poise closure in successful coupling and "maiden voyage begins" with undeniable precision cost; orientation anchored early in depot/shop without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bowls as micro-setting constrain choices during climax ("slides a basin beneath the eave") and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (vibrations over sight) reflects artisan bias, evolving causally with fog and rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone-guided coupling) signaled early tightens via fog hesitation and second car slant, forcing agency in basin addition and code patch; cost legible in "numbers stumble" and tactical shifts narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sensory connection beyond sight emerges organically from bowls/drone rituals, resonating in final "depot returns the smile in the language of settled wheels" as non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sounds as "metal vowels," vibrations as geometry) biases noticing character-specifically; stable third-limited POV with rhythmic modulation under fog stress, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern ("rails and ropes wear the same color of wet," "anchor chain keeps climbing, rattling... like beads") taught early avoids muddle; minor metaphor density in climax deducts slightly but rhythm propels without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind sonic/light guidance transforms tropes via water bowls and drone pips; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens stakes, with "hummingbird lands, warm with work" as inevitable charged image.</comment>
