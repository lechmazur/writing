<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "resonantly soft" playing act simultaneously under statue pressure, compelling the heart-rhythm shift and final cessation with visible risk of seizure. Interiority particular through musical lens on body and pulse. Final endurance earned by prior signaling causality, foreclosing violent uprooting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from soft bow to shell-mute and heart signals, culminating in Charged Poise RR where statues root "not in command but in choice" with cost of potential punishment legible in "arms unfolding." Orientation anchored in opening lines. Single scene, one tightening via statue approach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sky-bridge and orchard constrain choices: fogged iron demands soft sound, statues' halos spin on noise, charging climax pause. Sensory evolution (sap to scent to wingless flight) mirrors escalation, integrates via bow-pressure. Final arcing branches recharge setting as active participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken orchard sans punishment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via heart signals narrowing to statue hand-pause, forcing heart-door unlock with felt cost of "lock[ing]... around my instrument and breath." Agency in pulse-translation forecloses flight path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fuller attention over escape emerges via particulars: shell as absence-cathedral, rhythms unlocking moss-memory, reweighting mechanical gnashing into sympathetic thrum. Final image ("beauty... teaches stone to dream") non-literal answer to reawakening question, resonant without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("bow became a conductor's wand," "tone... almost human") biases noticing toward resonance and pulse. Voice rhythms modulate with pressure, stable first-person without slippage. Compression purposeful, taught early via fog/iron lick.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels: multi-job lines like "locust shell... empty as a bell awaiting a tongue" advance image/character/stakes. Minor paraphrase in repeated "resonantly soft" but pattern-taught for motif, no closure touch. Varied syntax/paragraphs flow read-aloud, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: heart-rhythms evade stone-intercept, locust-mute awakens memory in mechanical stasis, risking daylight dream. Transforms guardian tropes via copper-halo sway. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from pulse-gap balance.</comment>
