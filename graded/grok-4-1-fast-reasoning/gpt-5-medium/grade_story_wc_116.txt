<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper's interiority is concrete and particular through embodied images like "flakes of mortar seasoning my tea"; motivation to witness without judgment earns final endurance with contradictory loosening of prior judgments. Final oath renewal shows hierarchy of values with visible cost in loose grip on reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of changes (mushrooms, flood) building to Resonant Reconfiguration closure in "regenerative silence renews me"; one tightening via flood retreat narrows to charged poise in witnessing oath. Orientation anchors early in library catacombs; cost legible in "reality itself seems to float, but the silence tethers me."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (river forces burrow to obsidian refuge) and charges closure; recurring swan and silence evolve tactilely through "slick with the breath of water" to final renewal. Sensory hierarchy reflects keeper's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of neutral witnessing tightens texturally via flood escalation, forcing burrow renunciation with cost in shifted tunnel; agency in swan consultations forecloses judgmental path. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at end, reweighting stake without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of non-judgmental witnessing emerges organically from particulars like mushroom alphabet and flood, culminating in resonant final image of silence repairing the world without moral statement. Subtext in loosening judgments invites ambiguity on change's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chronicle-filtered noticing ("letters crawl, then burrow"); rhythmic prose modulates with reflective intensity, stable first-person POV with lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; figurative language coherent and pattern-taught for textural lens, varying rhythm without loops or scaffolds. No artifacts dull closure image of silence tethering floating reality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living library chronicler navigating via origami swan transforms trope of forgotten knowledge into bold textural endurance; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes of witnessing without obscuring poise closure.</comment>
