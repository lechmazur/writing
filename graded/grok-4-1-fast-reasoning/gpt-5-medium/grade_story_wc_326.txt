<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in counting heartbeats versus speaking to ghost, embodied in iron taste and staccato pulse; final renunciation of feeding ghost earned by defragmentation causality with pocketed shard cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ink patterns and shard refraction tighten to defragmentation cadence shift; closure Charged Poise in "pocket...not as a wound, but as a lens" reconfigures failure with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Porcelain shard and spilled ink constrain choices (scraping frost, revealing calibration) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (frost webs, ink ripples) mirrors POV regret without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fix failure via ghost coordinates deepens through ink-revealed skew to defragment agency; cost unmistakable in mentor's "believed yourself big enough" forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shard shifts from wound-echo to carried lens reweights premise of failure-wisdom without moralizing; emergent theme from ink patterns and ghost voices invites ambiguity in "wiser kind of dark."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in heartbeat metronome and ink-as-river-stones noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in staccato pulse without leakage, elision of backstory taught early via shard cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "ink trembles as if struck by an unseen bell" propels without loops; purposeful lyric metaphors cohere (snow ash, ink flees), rhythm varies for pressure without overwrite in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink divination and digital-mentor ghost transforms redemption trope; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable via shard's hinge-knowledge, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
