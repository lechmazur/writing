<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to preserve wonder compels concrete micro-choices like clipping scars and teaching the child, earning the planting; interiority particular via sap/memory perception, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal pruning beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as essence gathers density to Charged Poise closure in seed-planting image ("careful work of keeping a path swept"), with felt cost legible in "not a miracle"; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and waterfall constrain planting choice and charge final image via mist-crack seam; sensory details (scent like bread rising, mossed stone) selectively mirror internal weaving, evolving with action without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder vs. forgetting) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via child's arrival and joint pruning, narrowing to planting renunciation with on-page cost ("child's promise"); agency drives but lacks explicit trade-off in climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preservation emerges organically from pruning/capturing actions, resonant non-literal close ("valley tasted a note like the memory of a lantern") reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (orchard in "sap and memory") biases noticing; stable single POV with rhythmic modulation (short breaths in teaching beat); purposeful poetic compression taught early, paid off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid images, but figurative overload (e.g., metaphors in most sentences of essence-gathering beat) risks coherence without pattern break; minor synonym loops ("radiant hush," "weaving") purposeful but drag momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of pruning as world-weaving transforms trope of wise guardian; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via seed's hunger, inevitable in hindsight at planting.</comment>
