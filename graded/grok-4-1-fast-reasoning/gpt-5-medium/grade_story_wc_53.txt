<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied contradictions, like hoarding/spending regret as currency, compelling the negotiation's verbs (admit, forgive) with visible cost in sunk regret; scavenger's flaws (plundering futures) drive inevitable misfilings that compound to truce. Final renunciation of running earns stasis without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from ascent to syncopation of clicks/waves, delivering Charged Poise closure in "regret...sinks with a relieved shudder" and cataloged sand—cost legible in foreclosed haste. Orientation anchors early ("resolute scavenger...climbed"); no shards, seamless surreal continuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lagoon constrains ascent (turbine raft, wind-ladders) and charges images (waves "clap like careful hands"); selective sensory hierarchy (clinks, sighs, churn) mirrors erosion, evolving causally to thinning clouds revealing parallels. Micro-setting (camera wheel) tethers pivotal offer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ghost negotiation) signaled early, deepens via demanded verbs narrowing to truce under Accumulative lens; agency in story-knotting and wheel-offer forces trade-off, cost unmistakable in "regret...sinks" and repurposed sludge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of erosion-to-utility emerges organically from penny-city dissolution to "sand good for gardens," reweighting ambition via charged final image ("breath becomes a craft") without moralizing; subtext in ghost's "restarted habits" lingers plausibly ambiguous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scavenger's lyric bias (time "slipping leashes," ambitions "eroded into sludge") with rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable first-person focalization teaches poetic compression early, paying off in hushed syncopation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "ladders of wind...rungs of rumor" advances ascent/voice); metaphors cohere (water/memory/erosion) without muddle, rhythm varies read-aloud from swells to claps—zero loops, scaffold-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-negotiation via camera-wheel clicks and story-knots transforms regret tropes; risk in surreal machinery (turbines-to-kettles) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
