<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (discipline vs. wavering hands) act in scene; final ring slippage on scarred finger earns realignment with embodied cost. Interiority concrete via ice-cracking hurt; Len's palm pressure forces relational choice. Flawless under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to RR closure (film to tide, ring kept) with legible cost in foreclosed exile. Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow constrains codes and records pressure; bluff edge enables disposal, charging final walk through silver hush. Sensory bias (sea breath, wind salt) mirrors renewal; micro-setting (cane, boot) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix self/network) signaled early; Len's nod tightens to disposal trade-off under Accumulative lens, narrowing to steady burn cost. Agency in pillbox click and sea release unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final ring image reweights "courage practiced, not spent" non-literally, emerging from pillbox evolution without statement. Subtext in silence/placement; complexity in endured scars lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fire's map, silver hush); rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise. Brief dialogue subtextual ("We are fixing what's broken"), distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops; rhythm varies (short pressures amid lyric breathers), metaphors coherent (snow artisan, water seed). Propulsion peaks at "let film find tide hungry," no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow codes and pillbox reprise transform spy trope via lyric Accumulative frame; prudently daring risks poetic compression that heightens renewal stakes organically.</comment>
