<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("notes descend through me like rain through porous rock"); motivation intensifies via past mapping refusal cracking like "dry estuary mud," earning final pivot to internal map without erasure. Contradictory impulses (chart grief, don't erase) act in clearing kneel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to cadence shift at stillpoint ("sorrow unfolds its chart without vanishing"), reconfiguring options with consent-to-pivot cost legible in final earth-touch flood. Orientation anchored early ("ultrasonic forest"); closure RR intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ring and skin constrain choices (cools suddenly, aches finger; fern writes on wrist), charging final image; ultrasonic leaves/bark integrate tactilely into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart emotional depths) signaled early, tightens texturally via note intervals "tilt[ing] spine toward harmonic north" to clearing pressure; agency in dowsing forecloses escape with "axis" cost felt in marrow-map realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (grief as "planet the size of an ache"); final image ("night steps with me") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (touch as "braille for ears," skin absorption) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, stable first-person lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels (multi-job lines like "ultrasound strikes the ring, and the metal cools or warms"); figurative pattern purposeful/consistent, no loops; minor density slip in reflective blocks doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind skin-mapmaker + ultrasonic idiom transforms mapping trope; risk-taking in textural quest heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight via ring's hush.</comment>
