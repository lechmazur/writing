<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in "chronologically homesick, stranded between tenses," with micro-choices like drawing frost notches revealing contradictory ache for past versus present invention; final renunciation of commanding for listening earned through memory mapping. No stock phrasing; flaws like cryptic isolation complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from shell-listening to breath-diagramming, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure in "fortunes were not riddles but instructions for breath," with conceptual cost of yielding command to silence's orchestra legible in final seam-smile image. Orientation anchored in opening lines; no shards, seamless scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Glass spire's "throat" and frozen lake's mirrored horizon constrain choices (frost staff, wind prelude) and charge closure thaw-blush; sensory hierarchy (ice groans, shell surf) reflects perceptual bias, evolving causally from pale dawn to parting seam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to conduct unheard symphonies signaled early, escalates accumulatively through memory notches tightening to breath-instructions, agency in shell-warming and wind-cueing foreclosing command-path with felt silence-cost in "orchestra I invented is only listening."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of tending silence emerges from particulars like steam-violin and pizzicato-motes, resonant CR in fortunes-as-breath reweighting riddle-to-instruction without moralizing; lingering ambiguity in diner's future hush sustains complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in shell-surf and frost-consonants, rhythmic modulation from hush-whispers to crescendo-fog; stable first-person intimacy biases noticing (e.g., "world doubts which way is applause"), purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "draw a timeline across the frost... each notch is a note," rhythmic variety in short breaths and long echoes; no loops, coherent metaphors (whale-groans, pigeon-wings) enhance without muddling peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writing as symphony invention transforms tropes via memory-orchestra logic; risk-taking in lyric hush-heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in shell's "sated echo" recharging homesickness.</comment>
