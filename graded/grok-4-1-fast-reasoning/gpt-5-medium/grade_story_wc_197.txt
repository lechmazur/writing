<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in mother's legacy compels resourceful choices like puddle navigation and name-speaking, with embodied sting of indifference early. Interiority particular via water's revision of her image, but contradictory impulses more implied than simultaneous in peak activation. Final endurance as "the hinge" earned by prior micro-choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from museum caption to lagoon ripple-signal, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "the line hold[s]" reconfigures resistance with felt endurance cost. Orientation anchored early via exhibit and key retrieval. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in pocketed key and lowered hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting (puddles as map, "singing hinge" box in reeds) constrains path to lagoon and charges final image of resurfacing islands. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: wind "notes nobody could hear but her," ripple "smell[ing] of penny metal." Lagoon evolution mirrors internal revision without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore erased voices) signaled via caption, tightens via ripple response and synced lights under Accumulative lens. Agency in syllable-input forecloses indifference path with risk cost (siren stalls nearby). Escalation driven by her choices; moral calculus in naming vs erasure legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's resistance emerges organically via deleted names resurfacing in ripples, mother's voice affirming "the world keeps the shape of what it resists." Final image of "moths...stubborn grammar" offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity in coded truths avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: water as reviser, circuits carrying "loyalties." Poetic rhythm modulates from routine to pulse-sync at climax; purposeful compression taught early fits lyric mode. Mother's voice blends seamlessly without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm, e.g., short activation beats amid poetic swells. Minor overwriting in metaphor density (e.g., "birds startled from reeds") purposeful for textural lens but borders coherence in high-pressure ripple sequence. No loops or scaffolds; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: puddle-map circuits linking lagoon to museum transforms rebel trope into coded hydrology of memory. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes via image accumulation; irreplaceable "auric lagoon" under starlight inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
