<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied ("prickled my gums"), with contradictory impulses acting in discarding assumptions before pressing hush; grandmother vision ties personal motivation to stake without backstory excess. Final endurance of leaving elements earned with felt growth cost. Minor abstraction in emotional progression prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as signals density rises to faces and city response, tightening to CR closure when mast plays prologue backward and hatch unfolds with conceptual cost of reweighted endings. Orientation anchored early in tower arrival; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint of fall below shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective (towers as "ribs," gorge as "orchestra pit"), constraining climb and tilt choices while charging final image of moon as metronome. Body perception narrows under wind pressure; recurring mast/lightning scar guides action without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to interpret/revive city signaled early, escalates texturally via signal density and refusal until hush clarifies echoes, forcing trade-off in leaving elements. Cost legible in "future storms would know the script." Agency via micro-choices like threading fragment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in endings emerges organically from hush/stardust signals and note's "Begin last, end first," reweighting premise in grandmother's handle reveal without moralizing. Final image resonates via garden of unsent messages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("testing wonders with calipers and stories with solder") biases noticing toward fantasy practicality; rhythmic modulation accelerates in climb, compresses at hush press. Vision dialogue natural/subtextual, advances without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm ("groaning, singing"); metaphors consistent in lyric pattern without muddle. Minor figurative density in peak signal rise slightly slows but pays off at closure; no loops or scaffolds obscure cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio ghosts and hush shard transforms trope of haunted tech into "gorge as record"; risk in nonlinear signal play heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early shard to threaded charm.</comment>
