<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's contradiction—persistence in silence breaks via singing—earns change with cost of opening to shared work; "though he was the silent carousel carpenter, he chose to sing" reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: resonance patterns (hush, bells, halo) build density to RR closure where carousel turns "by consent" with felt cost of yielded solitude; orientation anchored in first lines, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Train cars, oasis, bells constrain choices (wrong turn yields voice, tank knits light); recurring halo charges final etching, sensory hush/touch filters carpenter's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore via silence) tightens texturally via oasis/song cadence shift narrowing to resonance over power; agency in singing forecloses mechanical path with cost of vulnerability, legible in platform's stuttered turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility emerges organically from hush-to-song arc; final image ("difference between silence and song felt negotiable") reweights motifs with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in sonic/textural bias ("chime of wind bells," "whispering gleam"); rhythm modulates from hush to synchronized pulse without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm in lyric mode; figurative consistency ("needle tames unraveled cloth") taught early pays at closure without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus decay into resonance revival transforms tropes via song-as-power; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at shared etching.</comment>
