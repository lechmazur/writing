<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vivid and particular through light-hauling metaphors and pensive mirth; motivation to rediscover joy drives micro-choices like pulsing the network; communal pressure reveals flaws in solo competence without indistinct group blur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from solo film threading to communal corrections and looping wreath; closure as Charged Poise in "pockets smelling of pith and laughter" reconfigures joy with felt communal cost; orientation anchored early in orchard fog.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog as dynamic screen constrains projections and enables network corrections, charging final wreath image; sensory hierarchy (citrus ghosts, drip giggles) filters via artist's vivid temperament; stump anchors choreography without spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy tightens accumulatively via failed solo repair to network deepening; mirror maker's reverse suggestion forces trade-off, with cost in "hands forgot heaviness" amid pressing night; agency in communal display sustains pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of joy's structure emerges from pomegranate seeds and film corrections, reweighted in looping invitation without moralizing; final "ribbon in the fog" offers non-literal resonance tying light-painting to communal endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fruit-seed diction and light-bending syntax modulates with intensity; stable first-person focalization biases toward memory-rooms; network speech carries subtext via corrections without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied openings and image density, but figurative layering in communal peak ("fog rippled into oranges") risks minor overwrite coherence; no loops, high propulsion sustains momentum to wreath unwind.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fog-projections and crow-taught manners transforms orchard ruin into joy-ribbon; risk in reverse-loop closure heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
