<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's attentiveness shines in embodied micro-choices like thumb-testing the parachute buckle and tapping the rail, revealing contradictory impulses toward apology unspoken yet trust preserved. Past glider failure anchors motivation without flattening pressure, earning the final nod's relational cost. Blind spots from prior scar add genuine struggle, driving inevitable caution that compounds tension until release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whirlpool clouds to air blister shudder, culminating in Charged Poise closure via the nod reconfiguring ongoing debt—"we are not done paying"—with felt harness adjustment cost. Orientation anchors early in arbor platforms and radio timeline. Single scene causality intact, no breaks touching the cradle kiss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via rail taps, rope veins, and cradle docking, with parachute buckle as micro-setting charging the ritual vow during wing lean. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactiles under crisis—"knees echo their shape"—filtered through POV's pattern-seeking bias. Clouds' heat-fist vortex mirrors internal burden, evolving causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust via safe docking—tightens accumulatively through pilot's "old route feels wrong" request and blister reversal, forcing inventive guidance with trade-off cost in unspoken apology. Agency in lantern shift and taps narrows options legibly. Final nod crystallizes stance with undeniable relational price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of muscle memory vs. fallible patterns emerges organically from particulars like scar-line friendship and "harness adjusted rather than dismissal," offering resonant non-literal answer in nod's reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext layers in soundless ritual echoes charging closure image. Complexity lingers in partial loosening—"not fully gone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing—"wind carried a soundless echo"—with rhythmic syntax modulating from creaking vowels to clipped radio, stable first-person distance under stress. Radio dialogue carries subtextual humility in pilot's request, advancing plot naturally. No head-hopping; elisions taught early via patterns pay off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "rope veins ran along the boughs, and lanterns glowed low," but minor overwrite in dense metaphors—"stitched moth," "plaiting rope from night"—risks coherence in peak blister beat without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies purposefully, read-aloud ear strong. Zero artifacts touch closure sigh.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aerial arbor world with pattern-seeking transforms docking trope into muscle-memory ritual, risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes via whirlpool invention. Final "small nod that says we are not done paying" feels inevitable from scar groundwork, no derivative echoes.</comment>
