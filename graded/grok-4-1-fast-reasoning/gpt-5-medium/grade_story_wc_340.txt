<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied affection (humming reassurances to bolts) and contradictory impulses (detachment yet purposeful hands); final commitment ("I will, and mean it") earned by causal buildup of diary revelations, foreclosing detachment without cost to joy-seeking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-tightening per floor (glyphs awaken via goggles on second rise); orientation anchored by ~50 words; Charged Poise closure in arranging letters with legible emotional cost ("grief and laughter share a shelf"), reconfiguring motive without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Icebound spire and elevator "throat" constrain choices (scattered shaft light enables cipher) and charge final image (light fans across niches like forgiving hand); sensory selection POV-biased (frost flowers as coins), vivid yet economical, mirroring internal unfolding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decrypt joy beneath anguish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via floor-deepening (confession on ninth); agency in micro-choices (angling goggles) narrows options, but external pressure low; cost felt in final renunciation of clutching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of affection unlocking pain emerges organically from particulars (pain as "folded letter"); final image ("clouds below seem to breathe") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on mercy's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice ("breath feels borrowed from cold saints") with perceptual bias (machine grins back); stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically under pressure; patterned lyric elision taught early, legible payoff in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (each floor's rhythm varies); figurative language consistent/voice-motivated ("fish learning air is another kind of river"), no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in metaphors doesn't obscure closure's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator ascent as diary decryption via light-mosaic in spire; transforms cipher trope through affectionate lens, risking bold poetic structure that heightens stakes organically to inevitable final reconfiguration.</comment>
