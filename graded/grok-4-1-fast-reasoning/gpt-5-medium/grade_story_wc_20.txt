<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between proof and wonder act through micro-choices like etching names and testing scales; final renunciation of pressing stone earns stasis with cost of self-measured limits. Interiority particular and embodied in "throat full of luminous regret."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of tests builds pattern (names' mass), CR closure in "seam's bright scar" reweights premise with conceptual cost of stubbornness. Orientation anchored in opening line; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Furnace and cracked cup constrain choices (tempering alloy) and charge final image; sensory details like "rain hissed louder" integrate with action, mirroring internal breakage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via balance) signaled early, tightens through scale pattern to agency-driven fusion; cost unmistakable in "not healed, but held together" foreclosing unscarred wholeness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of measured remembrance emerges organically from kintsugi and scales; final image "foundry glows like a memory that has learned to redeem itself" reweights prior experiments without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical diction ("golden soot," "stubborn ghost"); rhythmic control modulates from regret to poise, stable first-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (crucible, seam) without muddle, propulsion peaks in furnace scene rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, kintsugi, and name-physics transforms grief; risk in "factually mystical" world logic heightens stakes inevitably toward scar-balance.</comment>
