<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's luminous skepticism manifests in embodied taste-doubts and micro-choices like questioning Mirelle directly, earning final renunciation ("I am a skeptic, but I will carry your story") with relational cost of embracing "us."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds sensory density to CR closure where ring's needle shifts "not to a direction but to a pronoun" ("us"), costing solitary certainty; orientation anchors early via bluff/aurora/compass.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and aurora constrain navigation/encounter; tastes as body-setting charge final image ("aurora thinned like old tape") with evolving environmental interplay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Skepticism-validation stake deepens accumulatively via Mirelle's touch and gathering walk, forcing acceptance that forecloses doubt with conceptual cost in "taste of north... learning to say us."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Democratic weather debates emerge via forest elections/spore ballots, reweighting doubt in closure's sky-ground fusion ("sky can remember it belongs to the ground") without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Singular first-person voice with taste-biased perception ("wind tasted like pennies") stable; dialogue subtextual (Mirelle's mythic indirection vs. skeptic's direct query) advances under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High-density sensory syntax varies rhythm without loops or muddle; metaphors cohere in taste/weather pattern, propelling to crisp closure image ("violet breath... elders telling a joke").</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Taste-navigation and weather-custodians synthesize ecology/politics into fresh CR; lyric risk (e.g., "forests hold elections") heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
