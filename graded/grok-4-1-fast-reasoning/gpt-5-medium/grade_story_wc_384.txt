<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through thorn-prick embodiment and contradictory treason-justice impulses; final forgiveness earned via prior calibrated choices. Minor slip: mentor's traits slightly overshadow protagonist's independent flaws in peak reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure; "I leave a margin blank where a verdict might have gone" reconfigures stakes with legible emotional cost of unlinking. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring stalactites and aurora constrain timing/strokes and charge final image; sensory integration (drips tempo, columns as seashells) mirrors internal mercy without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (thorn, key) shapes choices indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgive unfinished) signaled early, textural deepening via key-hearing and writing narrows to renunciation with cost (grief's space, power unlinked). Agency in blank margin forecloses verdict path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of measured mercy emerges organically from unlinking wrists/strokes; final blank margin offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting treason as precision. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in city's betrayal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in ink/forgery metaphors; rhythmic modulation builds to lighter exhale at end. Stable first-person POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; figurative coherence (aurora veils, letters breathe) propels without muddle. Rhythmic variety peaks in "dripping stalactites tempo my strokes."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgery as mercy-tool transforms redemption trope; risk in bone-key/air-lock heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from thorn's evolving memory.</comment>
