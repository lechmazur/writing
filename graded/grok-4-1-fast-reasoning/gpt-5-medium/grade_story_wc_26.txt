<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mira's lean toward sorrow despite balance risks, culminating in earned trade of her dreams with visceral cost; Ilen's quiet archivist traits reveal through shadow's unbound browsing. Interiority particular via "river stone... to remind her how weight steadies wandering." Final renunciation of unlived life forecloses path organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (vines, petals, reels) tightens to RR closure where shadow contracts "like tide" after Mira's dream-pouring bargain, cost legible in "empty casing where her dreams had been." Orientation anchored early in library/mist orchards; one meaningful deepening via jealous vines. No ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blooming library constrains via tightening vines pressuring reels aisle; recurring stone/dew/petal objects charge final "petal storm" image mirroring restoration. Sensory bias (dusk colors fading, mist roots) filters through Mira's notice; spatial choreography clear from stacks to balcony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope's shape) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via footage seams → vine opposition → bargain, narrowing to trade-off with agency in pouring "stored dreams into the soil beds." Cost unmistakable in joy laced with "luminous regret"; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope preserved at regret's cost emerges via particulars (shadow's flinch, dream trade), final image reweighting bargain as "blossoms inked her name" without moralizing; subtext in shadow's "looping questions" implies lost belonging. Counter-reading lingers in library's jealousy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in dusk/listening to colors; rhythmic modulation peaks in "light rained... washing" under pressure. Single POV stable, no leakage; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("search the recordings"). Voice as character: syntax blooms with library's mist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in climax: "shelves sighed open"); high density, but figurative density in peak ("pressure, a wish forming... feared the cost") borders overwrite without muddle. Zero loops; propulsion clear, minor register elevation consistent with lyric voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams/shadow detachment in blooming library transforms tropes via stone-anchoring and vine-jealousy logic; risk in poetic compression pays off in petal applause closure. Non-obvious angle on belonging feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
