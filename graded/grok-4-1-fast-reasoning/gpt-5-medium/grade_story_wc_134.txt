<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clairvoyant's blind spot ("did not see it coming") drives contradiction, embodied in hand straying at climax ("my hand strays into a chord that empties me of certainty"), earning the reconfiguration with visible cost to prophetic certainty. Pilgrim's baker traits (flour scent, loaves proofing) root motivation particularity, compelling the pearl's choice. Internal conflict layers without tidy resolution; voices distinct in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cave singing to polyrhythms and pearl's birth of tone, culminating in Charged Poise/CR where offering the pearl reconfigures mission ("the reason this place exists, to magnify everyday magic"). Orientation anchored immediately ("After the pilgrim arrives, the cave begins singing"). Cost legible in guide's emptied certainty and subverted role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Musical crystal cave vividly sensory (stalactites' notes, crystal ribs ring on breath), constraining path ("pathways only patient ears can inhabit") and charging closure via echoing bread lines. POV bias filters (bright darkness as "color of listening"). Details evolve causally with breaths/music; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify everyday magic) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via music's intensification and pearl choosing pilgrim, narrowing guide's options at climax ("I reach to stop it"). Pilgrim's agency (kneel, offer) forces stance crystallization with cost (prophecy defied). Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: everyday magic over heroics, resonant in final laugh revealing purpose and "bright darkness becomes a cloak." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in guide's loss. Returning images (music, shadows) reweight without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature ("bright darkness, the color of listening"); lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. Voice modulates rhythmically with intensity; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("the dark here feels bright"). No head-hopping; diction biased to clairvoyant idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (music/bread interweave), but minor paraphrase loop ("overlapping shadows" x3, "steadily unpredictable" x2) dulls propulsion slightly mid-beat. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no template cadence or scaffold. Closure image clear ("music wraps us like a woven dusk").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: baker-pilgrim chosen by musical cave's pearl to magnify mundane (ovens, gossip), transforming quest trope via sensory lyricism. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight in flour triggering echoes.</comment>
