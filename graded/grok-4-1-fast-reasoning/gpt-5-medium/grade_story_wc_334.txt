<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in confession ("loved the work more than the woman"), embodied as crisp admission into silt, earning partial memory repair with visible cost of incomplete recovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chalked cracks to ring pulse and confession-actuated brightening, landing Charged Poise closure in ledger trace and apple bite where "not all... late fees" makes before/after cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mirrors constrain choices (catch sheen, new angle maps path) and charge final smeared constellations; kelp-furred ribs, brine apples filter via folklorist bias, evolving with silt settling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early tightens via agency in truth-confession that narrows to partial return, cost unmistakable in "not everything" and tide-forced exit under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-tithe emerges via orchard-sea graft shifting to repair through "stubborn as salt" writing; final image reweights particulars without moral, resonant via apple scene colors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (fractures hide stories, light remembers) biases noticing; rhythmic compression under dive stress ("silver and exact") modulates purposefully, stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "apples... small moons wearing rust blush") propels without loops; figurative coherence (constellations map ring) taught early pays off in closure charting, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore dive (chalk-mirrors decode brine ledger) transforms memory-trove trope; risk in lyric accrual heightens stakes via irreplaceable underwater patterns.</comment>
