<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Guarded druid's interiority shines in "anchored in warlike serenity" and contradictory impulses toward unbending heart at close; micro-choices like seed drop compel higher stakes with embodied calm under pressure. Final unbending earns change via prior causality, foreclosing guarded isolation with felt personal cost. No safety-hedging; flaws like wariness complicate retrieval without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via expanding circles to pupil opening and seed guidance, yielding Charged Poise closure as orchard unspools and truth glows with mayor's tremble as cost. Orientation anchors early in arrival post-trick; one tightening at eighth-circle tug narrows options purposefully. No ambiguity; persistent constraint of currents shapes tactics through finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex with "trees grow from anchored boats and apples orbit like moons" constrains raft angling and circle-mapping, charging final unspooling image. Sensory hierarchy (creaks, tugs, groans) reflects druid's priorities, integrated into action without stalls. Evolving details mirror internal thaw, with micro-setting (raft gunwale, kelp lines) guiding choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover confession) signals early, tightens accumulatively via circle snag and seed's hunger narrowing to lie-chewing cost on mayor/setting. Agency in treaty-whisper and haul alters tactics; visible prices (hooks twitching, groans) charge ending. Moral calculus between lie-eating and truth-bone legitimizes peak without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truths biting back emerges via seed devouring denial, resonating in final "spoken truths stop casting shadows" image without statement. Particulars like crystallized hooks shift to glowing soldier, reweighting mirrors' threats organically. Ambiguity lingers in druid's single-notch thaw, earning complexity from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spine rise like a mast") biases toward serene wariness; rhythmic compression heightens under stress (e.g., "syllable thawing into syllable"). Stable first-person focalization with voice-modulated syntax reflects druid's lexicon. Minimal dialogue but mayor's fogged breath carries implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "apples slow and listen" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density purposeful in taught poetic pattern, coherent without muddle, propelling to closure. Zero artifacts dulling image of settling halos.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druidic retrieval with lie-eating botany and orbital orchard transforms magic-trick trope into inevitable truth-unspooling. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes via irreplaceable seed mechanics. No derivatives; bold premise commits fully, charging conceptual repricing.</comment>
