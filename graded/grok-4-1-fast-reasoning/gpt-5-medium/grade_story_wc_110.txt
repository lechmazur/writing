<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (shiver at doodles' ache, heartbeat as drum pre-projection) and earned change from cowardice (holding lens as theft evidence) to public confession compel closure choice with visible cost (risking ledger role). Contradictory impulses act in scene via fear of rot vs. transparency drive. Minor slip: occasional abstract labels like "purpose unhidden" slightly dilute peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: doodle density builds knowledge, tightening to public projection decision (DC/RR hybrid). Orientation anchored early ("quiet night registrar... crystal whispering forecourt after rain"). Closure Charged Poise lands on-page with confession cost ("held the lens, that I held it too long") reconfiguring mistrust; persistent lens constraint shapes tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (puddles as "glass throats," crystals "chiming at the edges") filtered through registrar's light-obsessed POV; recurring crystals/puddles constrain choices (ticket boats sail slick, wet tarp screen). Final ripples across shoes charge closure image, mirroring thawed alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust post-failure) signaled early, textural escalation via doodle revelations narrowing options (curator shielded, not hoarded). Agency in projection/confession forecloses hiding path; cost legible ("decide if the ledgers deserve me"). Minor abstractness in "blame pulsed like a negative" softens visceral peak slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tender transparency emerges organically from doodles ("ambiguously clear") to projection, final image ("air writes it for me... truth... gentle enough to sleep in") non-literally reweights silence/mistrust premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/reflection bias: "drinks light and tells the truth") with rhythmic control (short confession gasps vs. flowing hush); stable first-person, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in legible closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density/propulsion with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent/patterned (light motifs build without muddle). Minor overwriting: figurative density in opening reflection ("puddles murmuring like glass throats") risks slight opacity pre-pressure, but closure image clear/charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wordless city communicates via doodles/projections transforms mistrust trope; risk-taking in lyric doodle "eavesdropping" drives inevitable closure without gimmickry, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
