<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via chemical metaphors tied to skepticism, with contradictory impulses shown in offering amber despite dissent; final realization earned by ritual participation costing nostalgic fog refusal. "Luminous skeptic" traits constrain choices like eyebrow raise without tidy epiphany. No diagnostic labels; embodied via breath slowing, amber flicker.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of convergence images builds to CR closure ("home is a rate constant") with patience cost legible in final path erasure. Orientation anchored early ("rainwashed tower in spring"); one tightening via basin reaction shifts air like "door had changed sides." No ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy canopy dust and rain pools constrain path via footprints, charging closure image of erasing traces; sensory hierarchy (bronze quiet, citrus scent) reflects skeptic's priorities. Micro-setting (amber, basin) evolves causally, mirroring internal convergence without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chemistry of homecoming) signaled early, tightens texturally via basin pulse narrowing to window intention; agency in naming destination and amber placement forecloses doubt with patience cost. Facilitator dissent tests commitment; no abstract stakes, felt in softened metronome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of convergence/home as rate constant emerges from particulars (amber filament, basin reaction) without statement; final image reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity on nostalgia vs. inquiry. No moralizing; irony in alien voice bowing to threshold.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chemical diction ("compounds of memory," "valence and patience"); stable first-person with biased noticing (lab over chapel). Rhythm modulates from quiet ascent to charged window; sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("academically rebellious").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful ("fly's shadow flicker"), no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short basin sentences accelerate). Minor overwriting risk in ivy exhalations, but voice-integrated without muddle at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of first-contact pilgrimage as lab ritual transforms tropes via skeptic's chemistry lens; risk in lyric convergence pays off in inevitable CR. Irreplaceable amber lodestar and dust guidance heighten stakes organically.</comment>
