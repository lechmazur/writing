<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ivo's micro-choices (tracing coin, folding maps) reveal particular skills and values under pressure; Rade applies secondary pressure via status clash. Internal conflict mild—confident endurance lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats. Final nod earns closure via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: challenge → whisper method → courier found → gate persuades open → Rade's surrender (violet face, raised hands). Charged Poise closure on-page with felt cost in silence "like a full cup"; orientation anchors early (port maze, storm).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Port labyrinth constrains tactics (alleys, seams, frozen cranes); sensory hierarchy (boot scrapes, brass note) reflects Ivo's ear. Zodiac coin and brass key as micro-settings charge final hinge moment; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find courier via whispers, prove method) signaled in challenge; causal tightening narrows shouting men's options, Ivo's agency forecloses noise path. Visible cost: Rade breathless, men pound uselessly; reweights at end image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (murmurs outrun shouts in steel cycles) emerges via particulars (brass whisper threading maze); final line non-literal answer recharges premise without moralizing. Resonance from walk ID, coin pause contra Rade's roar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (reads walks/thermals, tastes metallic); voice modulates rhythm (short taps in climax). Dialogue subtextual (Ivo's cat-whisper vs Rade's bark), distinct idiom; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short taps build tension), density high but purposeful; figurative overload in climax ("lung inhaled whisper", "nod") borders coherence without muddle (−0.4). No loops, scaffold; propulsion weaves setting into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: walk-reading, singing key tunes maze—transforms port trope via Ivo's senses. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes; final "rivers bend" inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
