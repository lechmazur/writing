<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like pressing the fossil to the wall and speaking tested words; motivation roots in restraint and partnership, earning the fossil's residency as stasis with cost. Minor diagnostic labels ("Green means openness") slightly abstract emotion without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mapping to vapor pattern to storm test, landing Charged Poise closure in "the contract holds" with conceptual cost of restraint voiced in final image. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent with legible progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (microcurrents, mineral hair, dripping strands) constrain choices like following the green vein and wedging into the throat tunnel during surge; recurring fossil charges final niche placement. Cave network mirrors internal states through heat map flares without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart cave meanings via negotiation) signaled early, escalates via chamber spike, fossil exchange, and storm surge under Accumulative lens with density reweighting to amber trust; agency in placing leaf forecloses carrying it, with visible cost in logging promise as material.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of partnering the unknown emerges organically from fossil contract and thermal grammar, resonating in final "my voice learns restraint" without moralizing; returning leaf shifts from token to resident, reweighting human-cave time with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("thermal grammar," "heat-mapping emotions") biases noticing toward cave's "language"; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, stable POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion, purposeful "remembers" pattern in opening; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("hollow like a throat behind a curtain of mineral hair") during entry slightly muddles but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation cave negotiation via fossil contracts and emotion heat-maps transforms eco-mysticism trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "the unknown hums under my words, not captive, but partnered."</comment>
