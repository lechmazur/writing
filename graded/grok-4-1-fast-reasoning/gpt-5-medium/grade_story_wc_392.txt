<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied calm under pressure shown in steadying breath amid memories; final report-signing choice earned by prior contradiction between empirical duty and entangled memories, foreclosing algorithmic closure with personal cost. Contradictory impulses act in-scene as lantern-turning blends father’s death and workers’ wait. 9+ test met: impulses and earned renunciation with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations (salt, ripples, lantern soot) builds to CR closure in lantern-offering image reweighting empirical isolation vs. shared risk, with cost of defying supervisor legible in radio-off and report-signing. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via key-turn deepens stake without micro-turn excess. Cost proof: "signed the cause as preventable, collective, and mine to report upward."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel micro-setting (salt-crusted grates, stalled ripples, third rail) constrains choices like drain-logging and charges final shaft-offering; sensory hierarchy (wet resonance, rail hum) reflects investigator's priorities. Lantern as recurring object mirrors internal states through handling, evolving from relic to carried lesson. 9+ test: constrains report and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truthful report vs. easy metrics) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory-deepening that narrows to agency in radio-silencing and signing, forcing trade-off with career cost felt in "fidelity to lives whose evidence covers your boots." One tightening sufficient under lens; cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared risk vs. isolated discipline emerges organically from workers' wait, lantern memories, and report; final image non-literally answers communal authorization question by lantern-return with reweighted "light belongs to use." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like braided ropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (soot as fingerprints, vapor as lung); rhythmic control modulates from calm observation to flared intensity at key-turn without head-hopping. Voice prose-as-character reflects fortified mind; no elision issues. 9+ test: signature and control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tunnel dimmed, as if the small light taught darkness"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (ropes braided for strength). Zero figurative muddle in peak lantern-beat. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of low-water drowning via salt/waiting/discipline, transformed by Underground Railroad lantern entangling past/present risks; non-obvious angle on "preventable" yields inevitable hindsight resonance in communal lesson. Bold textural risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
