<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied actions like placing the dictionary on the lectern and feeling stone warmth; contradictory impulses in writing "Unify the broken record" then realizing hinge role earned with felt cost of surrendered certainty. Final renunciation of judge identity to listener forecloses prior path on-page. No stock phrasing; voice particularizes flaws as cosmic memory burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via spiral walk to center lectern, culminating in CR closure ("I was... a hinge") with conceptual cost of certainty traded for questions, reweighting premise. Orientation anchored early ("ancient temple library... dictionary"); one tightening at speaking illusions names. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains via spiral mosaic dictating arbitration path and hush tremor guiding; meteor-stone lectern and leather straps charge final image as straps "coil back with... whisper." Sensory hush "breathed between shelves" mirrors internal unification. Micro-object dictionary integrates tactilely, evolving from tool to warmer holder of scroll.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unify broken record vs. echo forever) signaled in margin note; escalation via Accumulative lens in density of illusions named and scroll found, forcing stance to hinge with visible cost ("each pace gave away my certainty"). Agency in circling "listen" and placing scroll narrows options. Cost unmistakable in faded "hiccup's echo" and steadied world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of unifying breath (out/in) emerges organically from particulars like circled dictionary sense and deferred-scroll weather; final image ("world inhaled as if remembering") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting illusions premise without moral. Subtext in silence judging via hush; ambiguity lingers in hinge role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (hush as "distant sea inhaling"); rhythmic diction ("wanderingly exact") modulates from declarative arrival to quiet realization. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure image; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "steps wanderingly exact" advance image/action/atmosphere; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Coherent metaphors (hush chord, fish surfacing) in peak center beat; minor figurative density fits pattern without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dictionary as history-unifier in time-lost library; risk in poetic spiral arbitration transforms tropes of witness/journey into hinge realization. Bold voice commits to lyric mode heightening stakes; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight via cosmic illusions unraveled.</comment>
