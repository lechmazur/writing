<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's embodied conflict (rattling stone star) and contradictory impulses drive micro-choices toward earned verbal release on the scale; oracle's cryptic pressure forces character-specific revelation without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with image density tightening from gentian smudge to scale confession, landing Charged Poise closure (tension leaves shoulders amid storm) with legible emotional cost in final ridge dawn image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weather station's instruments (barometer, anemometer, scale) constrain choices and charge closure; recurring gentian and body-as-setting mirror internal sway, with sensory details (antenna wires' tongues) filtered through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weigh truth) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through oracle's exercises to verbal naming, forcing renunciation with shoulder-release cost; minor abstractness in initial lie withhold slightly mutes peak agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Swaying certainties and fault-tolerance emerge organically from particulars (soot fulcrum, balance test), reweighting premise in non-literal final gentian compass without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (weather as emotional idiom) sustains first-person stability; oracle's dialogue carries subtextual indirection, advancing via cryptic prompts like "occupy margins."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion and density strong, but minor figurative overload in peak confession beat (e.g., "capillary sea") risks coherence without full payoff, though no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological oracle and swallowed truth transforms confession trope; weather station's ingenuity heightens stakes through swaying physics without gimmickry.</comment>
