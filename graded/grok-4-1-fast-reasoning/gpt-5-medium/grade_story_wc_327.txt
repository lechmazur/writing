<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strength in embodied micro-choices like pressing the diamond and building listeners reveal contradictory fear-duty impulses; name sacrifice at "I offered my name... leaving a ringing cavity" earns final endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from initial rasp to "flood of textures became choir" as Resonant Reconfiguration; cost legible in lost name and choice to stay, with pattern taught early and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Echo-tunnel and cliff notches constrain tactics from alignment to widening; recurrent walls charge closure's "texture learned to sing," with selective sensory bias toward sound/texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake of translation deepens texturally via curse demand and bird-scatter reversal, forcing name trade-off; agency in breath-fed listeners narrows options with on-page personal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation via texture emerges organically; final "dead language learned to travel again" non-literally reweights death-of-language premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature biases toward sonic textures like "rasp like bark scraped by winter"; rhythmic prose modulates pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "wind stitched a grammar between wings and cliff"; zero loops or muddled metaphors sustain closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Bold synthesis of bird-flight grammar and diamond-curse transforms language-death trope; "echoes... taught them how to carry questions without bruising them" feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
