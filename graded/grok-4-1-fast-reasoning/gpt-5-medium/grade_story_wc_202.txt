<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to recover names drives concrete micro-choices like speaking coordinates into the canvas, earning the closure revelation with embodied cost (swallowed worlds, patience). Painter applies subtle opposition via shrug, forcing persistence. Interiority particular via sensory translations (tar of wharves), no stock epiphanies; minor abstractness in "anchors of intuition" doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lens setup to painting breath and name surfacing as Charged Poise RR with felt cost (patience tethering to shore). Orientation anchored in first line; single scene coherent, no shards. Closure legible in "Her name surfaced twice... held fast," reconfiguring anonymity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (rope bridges sigh like flutes, varnish as tidewater) filters through translator's bias, constraining choices (wind pulls ropes mirroring intuition tugs). Recurring painting/lens as micro-setting charges final image (sailcloth tied to frame). No white-room; market evolves with revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor hidden history) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lens reveal, painter shrug (tightening opposition), to name recovery foreclosing anonymity. Agency in pressing lens/unfastening linen shows trade-off (no third world). Cost unmistakable in "swallowed two worlds"; painter nod crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of histories in pigment/fracture emerges organically from lens-painting interaction, culminating in resonant non-literal answer: sailcloth restores scene from drowning anonymity. Subtext in crane silhouettes remembering wrist tilt avoids moralizing; final image reweights prior concealment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("skylines say to shadows") stable in first-person, modulating rhythm with pressure (short breaths in revelation). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (painter's shrug, "only texture"); no head-hopping, elision taught early via elusively tangible lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm (varying lengths, read-aloud musical); metaphors coherent/pattern-taught (tidewater fissures). Minor overwriting in revelation beat ("letters rose like fish, shy, silver") risks density dip but doesn't obscure closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical market and relic-translation transforms recovery trope via lens-painting mechanic, risking bold lyric voice. Final reconfiguration (market brightens post-name) inevitable from particulars; no derivatives, authentic vision coheres.</comment>
