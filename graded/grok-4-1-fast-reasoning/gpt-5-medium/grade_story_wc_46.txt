<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in polishing actions ("circle the glass against a sand-smooth slate") rooted in village fire memory; motivation to create safe light earns endurance with brother's absence as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as polishing density and memory shards build to Conceptual Repricing closure in garland's gentle illumination ("faces brighten without glare"); cost legible in foreclosed fire path and village wariness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto mist and sea glass supply resources constraining patient polishing and charge final image ("stringed ovals peopled by dusk and mist"); sensory selection (petal-cool breeze) mirrors POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fireless light tightens accumulatively via polishing process and memory deepening, forcing renunciation of quickness; village response ("hands unclench") makes cost visible without touching closure perfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patience over quickness emerges organically from particulars, resonant in final image reweighting brother's "safer star" promise ("gentle compass called homeward").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable with perceptual bias ("waves continue inside it, round as a heartbeat"); rhythmic modulation supports accumulative poise, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density purposeful in lyric mode but figurative density ("mist moves like gentle handwriting") slightly slows propulsion in polishing beats; no loops, strong propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sea glass as patient lanterns transforms fire trope into fresh earthbound ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via grotto-to-village arc.</comment>
