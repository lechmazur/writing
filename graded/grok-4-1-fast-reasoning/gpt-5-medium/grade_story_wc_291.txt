<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia concretely shapes methodical tracing and painting without faces, driving micro-choices like lancing silt; contradictory impulses emerge in trusting "wrong" evidence over files.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as findings (ribbon, phone case) densify to conceptual repricing in painting/letter; cost legible in "I do not know who harmed her," reweighting absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry's mist, silt, and ladder constrain lancing and ground-soft party site, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (hush, ribbon kink) reflects POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth from traces) tightens via wrong-color ribbon forcing theory reversal; agency in imagining/unifying escalates under lens, cost in foreclosed "fox mask" legend.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges organically from ribbon/object contradictions to painting's bridge; letter offers non-literal answer reweighting empathy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (riverbeds remember water) biases noticing traces; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to charged poise, stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (e.g., "ribbon floats like a bridge"); minor overwriting in sustained metaphors slightly dulls propulsion but serves lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's textural "portraits" transform cold case trope via opposites motif; risk in poetic structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
