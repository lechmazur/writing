<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's wistfully pragmatic trait shines in embodied contradictions—shaking wrists taught patience like "stubborn seeds"—earning the final propagation choice with visible cost in endurance. Father's influence roots lockpicking motivation concretely without epiphany. No safety-hedging; flaws like delay amid grief complicate until resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: petal signal launches continuous scene of rowing/picking/lighting, tightening via lock click ("shackle surrenders... heart deciding not to leave me") to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in final image of rooting light home amid grief. Orientation anchored early (fire escape, harbor); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor constrains choices (cold stone through pants, salt hinges) and charges final catwalk image under beam. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: oarlocks "sing gentle complaint," gulls forgive via fish plant eyes. Micro-setting (brass tooth, lantern wick) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relight to honor promise) signaled early, escalates texturally via petal trigger, lock tension ("measuring absence"), to agency-driven lighting with deepening cadence. Cost unmistakable in physical/emotional strain (shaking wrists) foreclosing delay. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of propagating kindness from loss emerges via particulars (lantern "houses the flame with glass that can break"), final image resonantly reweighting fire escape as architecture without moralizing. Subtext in silences (quivering hush); ambiguity lingers in "promises for next workable patch."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read a lock... like soil") biases details poetically; syntax/rhythm modulate from steady oar pulse to flame's "soft astonishment." Stable first-person; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied rhythms ("moon shoals on waves") avoid loops; figurative pattern (gardens/doors/light) coherent, no muddle. Strategic telling compresses backstory; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Zero scaffolds; read-aloud natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fire escape gardener lockpicks derelict lighthouse with father's tool, transforming grief tropes via "door as garden in winter." Risky lyric risks pay off in charged poise; no template echoes, inevitable hindsight from petal-to-brick propagation.</comment>
