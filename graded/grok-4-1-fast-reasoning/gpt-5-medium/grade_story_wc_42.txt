<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied patience ("coaxed reluctant capacitors with the slow heat of my palm"), with contradictory impulses between others' fear and sage-listening driving micro-choices; final endurance of fleeting photons earned with cost of persistence. Voice particularizes traits without labels. Minor competence tilt balanced by quake's subtle struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from blurred images to sharp Moon intimacy ("crater walls casting braided shadows"), culminating in Charged Poise closure where chronometer fix reconfigures time's rhythm with conceptual cost of unlearning silence. Orientation anchored early ("lunar observatory above the clouds"). One tightening via repairs suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tools like cooling lines ("breathed like a sleeping animal") and secondary mirror constrain choices, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (sounds over visuals in tuning) reflects POV bias. Quake cracks subtly pressure alignment. Recurrent leaf sound as micro-setting mirrors internal attunement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness lunar quiver post-quake) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening as images sharpen after tweaks, narrowing options from "pale rains" to pulse against noise; agency in repairs forces trade-off of stubborn alignment. Cost legible in persistent listening despite dispersal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening to noise/messages emerges organically from leaf motif shifting to Moon's "shy shadows"; final image reweights premise (Moon speaks) without moral, embracing ambiguity of fleeting signals. No tidy resolution, complexity in instruments' dialects.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sound of a leaf falling, translated into clicks") biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from frantic chronometer to poised dawn. Stable first-person, no leakage; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density ("Light is a fleeing animal; touch it wrong and it bolts") propels without loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent in lyric mode, no muddle in peak repair beats. Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sage-repairer attuned to instrument "dialects" transforms observatory trope; risk in lyric elision heightens stakes of ephemerality, inevitable in hindsight via leaf-chronometer arc. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
