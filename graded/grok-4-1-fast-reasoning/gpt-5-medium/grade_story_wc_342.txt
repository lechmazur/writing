<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia uniquely shapes perception and choices, turning affliction into guide for matching coin to rings and painting cloud "shoulders"; final endurance of mural earns change with time cost legible. Contradictory impulses act in testing paint limits until it fractures, revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coin discovery layers into safe, pigments, letter-guided painting, culminating in Charged Poise as mural catches sky slice before blast, reconfiguring endurance with demolition cost on-page ("the blast thuds... the old building folds"). Orientation anchors early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tree grain/rings constrain key choice (coin notch match); coin resin, vials integrate tactilely into action, charging final image where dawn glows on bark post-fall. Sensory hierarchy (dust motes, breath careful) reflects urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete mural pre-demolition) signaled early tightens via foreman cough/extra minute, forcing trade-off; agency in backing off fractured blue shows deepening under lens. Cost unmistakable in heart slowing to grain and building collapse testing endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of limits/memory emerges organically from coin beats, guild letter, and mural surviving fall, reweighting premise in final image ("dawn still glows... bright as a promise") without moralizing. Subtext in prosopagnosia aiding faceless sky enriches without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (edges/weights/pressure) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic compression modulates with intensity, as in "breath chooses careful places" to peak hush. Stable first-person focalization with no elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative density slightly overwrites high-pressure painting beat ("glaze so thin it chooses its own path"), bordering coherence slip without obscuring closure. Zero loops; motifs purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Face-blind sky-painting in fractal coin puzzle transforms tropes organically; risk of poetic implosion heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via tree's endurance. Non-obvious synthesis of prosopagnosia and demolition feels singular.</comment>
