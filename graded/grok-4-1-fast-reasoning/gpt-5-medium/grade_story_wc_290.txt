<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in embodied claustrophobia ("old tightness rise behind my ribs") acting simultaneously with forward steps, earning final endurance at the observatory door with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density to CR closure ("mutiny was not refusal, only a hunger to be heard"), with cost legible in final cobbles alignment reweighting premise; orientation anchored early in nexus/plaza.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Compass point and alleys constrain choices (pricking triangle, coping stones), charging final telescope image; sensory hierarchy (organ's "lungs," silt's cold) filters through POV bias without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (uncover key amid mutiny/fear) deepens via organ-aided geometry narrowing alleys/options, with endurance cost in "lungs fluttered"; agency coherent under Accumulative lens, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final CR image ("cobbles aligned like a held note") resonantly answers spatial hunger theme from particulars like key's "constellations," reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (spaces as "sleepers turning," "elaborate shrugs") biases noticing claustrophobically; rhythmic control heightens under stress, stable first-person with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "pipes inhaled, then exhaled a low wave") with varied rhythm; metaphors cohere in geometry/sound pattern without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny/organ dialogue premise synthesizes fresh urban lyricism; risky compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via city-as-heard entity.</comment>
