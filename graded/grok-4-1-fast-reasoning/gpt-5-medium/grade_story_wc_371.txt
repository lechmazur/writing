<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (late noticing vs. present tenderness) act in micro-choices like whispering names to warm the room; earned shift to shared ritual with cashier forecloses complacency with felt cost of ongoing vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of small actions/observations builds to Charged Poise closure in seed-pressing and walk home; "line thrown from shore that I will have to keep holding" legibly costs normalization with reconfiguration of absolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard's thorns/nettle and moss-cloaked tea house constrain gentle pruning and crumb-tucking, charging seed-planting image; sensory selectivity (sesame/ash, steam) mirrors internal skittishness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of sacred-in-ordinary tightens texturally via litany to cashier's oven-crack reveal, forcing stance crystallization in communal laugh and practice; agency in reversible gardening bears visible cost of tenuousness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bread-crumb-seed progression offers non-literal answer to creeping normality via "careful company," reweighting prior losses without moralizing; resonance inextricable from flawed endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tiny surrenders," "heuristically gentle hands") biases toward tender particulars; dialogue subtext (her bow, "keeping watch") advances under stable single POV with rhythmic modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in lines like "leaves open like fists relaxing" propels without loops or muddle; varied rhythm breathes with scene, climaxing crisply in "no miracle, only careful company."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Creeping normality noticer" and guerrilla absolution ritual synthesize urban decay into ecological tenderness originally; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
