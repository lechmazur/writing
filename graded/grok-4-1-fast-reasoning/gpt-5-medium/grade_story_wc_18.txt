<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in Ilen's self-reminder "He was not a mystic" amid softening surfaces, earning the final realization that "the work was not to trap, but to teach holding" with embodied cost in steadying Noor's shake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density of fog, frost, mirrors builds to Charged Poise closure when "the dream settled into that glint as into a hammock," reconfiguring boundaries with undeniable conceptual cost in softened edges.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frost and fog constrain choices throughout—"boots sunk in rime," "heel to the frost"—and charge the final image of "fog kept a seam bright as glass mountains at dawn," with selective sensory bias via Ilen's carpenter gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture dream escalates accumulatively as "corridor wobbled, edges begging to split," forcing agency in Ilen's grounding count that narrows options, with legible cost in "mirrors tasting their own fear of shatter."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries emerges organically from recreating "exact geometry" to erase harshness, resonating in final "every mirror showed a city touching its orchard again" without moralizing, reweighting capture as care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in nature-infused diction ("frost lay like quiet ash") remains stable under pressure, with clean third-limited focalization modulating rhythm at peak sync without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative layering peaks densely in "stars flickered in its ribs like trapped bees," slightly risking coherence without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-capture via mirrors and breath in foggy orchard transforms tropes, with bold lyric risk in "mirrors sang like knives" heightening stakes inevitably toward glass mountains dawn.</comment>
