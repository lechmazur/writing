<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in "hands know where not to push as much as where to press," with contradictory gentleness under heat; past mislabeled mold anchors change to contrite accord, earning final endurance with cost in loosened fist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through braid tests to pour and bells speaking; closure as Charged Poise in final listening/sleep with cost of exhaustion and mended certainty on-page ("names still sounding"); orientation anchored early in sanctum/furnace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rope braids and aurora constrain choices (skylight slats open via braids), charging final triangle of bells; sensory weave (green hush, pennies/pine sap) filters through caster's priorities, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names via self-forgiveness) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as sounds emerge ("my own name surfaced") to bells' syllables; agency in braid pulls forecloses failed pour, cost in past error's rasp felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repair through listening emerges from particulars (organ holes to bells saying "forgive, stay"); final image reconfigures premise without moral, resonant via moss-like names.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with distinct perceptual bias ("soft resistance that means you can move a thing without breaking what it remembers"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, stable distance through peak pour.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("aurora fell exactly where the wax waited"); minor figurative density in pour beat coherent and purposeful, no loops; propulsion peaks in "triangle began to speak."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax casting with transcribed ghosts into auroral bells transforms trope of memory preservation; risk in lyric machinery (braids/horn) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
