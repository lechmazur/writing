<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's gift/curse as hearer drives contradictory impulses (e.g., prescriptions failed, yet persists under "shadowed rapture"), with micro-choices like whispering to night earning endurance at sculptor's release; no unearned epiphanies, fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup across circuits to Charged Poise closure ("we build a bridge... night itself learns to speak"); orientation anchors instantly at archway; seventh-circuit meteor tightens as pattern break with cost in failures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and brass instrument constrain choices (alignment, circuits) and charge final image (humming calls back); sensory selectivity (frost-braided words, gritty hands) mirrors internal thaw without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through faltering circuits and sculptor payoff; agency in tracing stars forecloses silence with felt cost (heavy instrument, learned patience), but minor abstractness softens one reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shadowed rapture emerges organically from star-tracing to city-wide unbinding, reweighted in bridge-building image without moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing rooms lingers plausibly, resonant via particulars like marble lungs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable, perceptual bias (hears frost-words) selective; rhythmic modulation peaks in meteor combing, purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure; sculptor's brief speech distinct in brightness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., vellum sketches advance beats), rhythmic variety; figurative saturation consistent in lyric mode without muddle, but minor paraphrase loops ("unwritten calendar" reprises) and synonym churn (stardust/pollen) dull two transitions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astral cartography freeing artists transforms tropes via star-script mechanics and unwritten calendar; risk in elliptical circuits heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from early pattern to city's speech.</comment>
