<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive paradox drives concrete micro-choices like wresting the rust-sealed latch and placing numbered slips, revealing internal contradiction between firmness and tenderness without epiphanic labels. Embodied emotions (boots remembering thresholds, hush that burns) ground endurance of memory's trembling. Final witness acceptance forecloses recognition with felt cost in "I do not wait for rescue or recognition," earned by prior placements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from promenade entry to deepest room's program discovery, tightening through pattern of notes in repairs. Orientation anchors immediately ("After the drawbridge rises, the river loosens its grip"). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in final slip mapping "living gaps" to love, reweighting absence with conceptual cost of eternal witness; bridge's "raised spine" charges the image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (silt shifts, damp like "letters never sent," carp as archivists) filters through surveyor's priorities, constraining access via rust latch and service door. Recurring pavilion arches and waterline evolve, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Tool (tripod) and body (boots) charge choices; final waterline mark on door ties to closure image, indispensable for tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archeologist of dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening rooms and program find, forcing endurance of "interlaced absence." One tightening in deepest room narrows to "hushed blaze" restraint. Agency in note placements forecloses repair illusion with cost of isolation ("no one expects a voice"); legible in "history will not lower itself," charging final alight stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restrained witness to absence emerges organically from placements and "hushed blaze," resisting tidy morals via paradox of mending gaps that "braid themselves." Final image reconfigures premise: pavilion "brightens strangely" as bioluminescent memory, resonant non-literal answer to loving voids without statement. Subtext in slips as voices ties character arc to complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (pilings' sighs, light unthreading into coins) biases noticing toward thresholds and silences, stable across lyric compression. Rhythmic modulation heightens immersion (short snaps like lighthouse, longer mapping cadences); purposeful elision of backstory anchors to present cues like chipped initials. Voice as character: syntax echoes stoic sensitivity, coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "tripod coughs against the balustrade, and the echo travels down to carp"); rhythm varies read-aloud, paragraph breaks breathe with scene. Purposeful lyric repetition ("interlaced absence") taught early pays off without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., wind as "reluctant broom") coherent overall, no closure touch; clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: surveyor as dream archeologist transforms drowned pavilion trope into "bioluminescent" memory cartography, with notes in mortar as ingenious witness. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes of absence without gimmickry. Irreplaceable final slip ("love them until they answer") feels inevitable, recharging motifs organically.</comment>
