<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to prove listening heals roots consistent traits like inventorying stories, compelling micro-choices (e.g., choosing locket, forming circle) under intrusion pressure; interiority concrete via embodied curation. Minor slip: lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak sharing beat, no deep flaw confrontation. Relationships (neighbors, crew) apply crucible pressure via stories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: story density builds via moths-to-bulb rumors to tumbler clicks, culminating in RR closure (lock opens to chorus, reconfiguring mailbox as library) with legible cost in shared vulnerability. Orientation anchored early ("vibrant courtyard... Harbor House"); one tightening via circle suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Courtyard/micro-setting (mailbox, hibiscus shadows) constrains choices (circle formation) and charges final image (unlocked as "throat cleared"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (sandal scuffs, coffee breath gritty hush). Details evolve causally (intrusion presses gates); body/tools tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove listening heals mailbox mystery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via story-sharing density forcing communal vulnerability amid intrusion; agency in curating circle forecloses isolation path with emotional cost. Escalation coherent under Accum lens, one deepening (clicks to sigh) narrows to reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (listening as healing) emerges organically from particulars (rumor ribs, ache metronome), final image (letters as open library) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting intrusion threat without moral. Subtext in silences/gestures; ambiguity lingers in Noemi's return promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (stories before objects, lead-by-following idiom); poetic rhythm modulates from calm to brightening spine. Experimental compression taught early (moth powder, sandstorm hush), legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short breaths in circle, longer cataloging). Minor overwrite: metaphor density in climax ("metronome of ache") borders muddle but pattern-taught; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Clean syntax, specific verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis: communal listening as literal key transforms thrift trope; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes (metal remembers human). Inevitable hindsight via hairpin tap; no derivative echoes.</comment>
