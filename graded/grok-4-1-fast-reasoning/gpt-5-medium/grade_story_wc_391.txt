<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in sculpting patience from impatience acts in scene via unyoking urgencies; final teaching choice earned by viaduct ledger and village work, with embodied cost in blunt tools.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as image density (ice, viaduct, moon paths) tightens to Charged Poise closure; "our patient revolution stood" reconfigures stance with conceptual endurance cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and viaduct constrain choices (mapping, walking after rain); final "basalt warmed" charges closure image, mirroring internal hush through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient revolution signaled early, escalates texturally via girl's question and men's grumble to widening steadiness; cost felt in foreclosed shout for soft purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patience as shaping emerges implicitly; final image of revolution "stood" offers resonant answer, reweighting urgencies without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in horizon/mapping diction; rhythmic modulation peaks purposefully at "world admit us like a house unlatching," stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in lines like "ice beneath the far arches crackled with private music"; no loops, figurative pattern taught early without muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes revolution as patient mapping with fresh viaduct/horizon angle; risk in lyric shards heightens stakes, inevitable at "horizon is closer than before."</comment>
