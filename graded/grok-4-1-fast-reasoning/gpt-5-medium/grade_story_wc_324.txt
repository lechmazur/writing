<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's persistent curiosity compels the wasteful walk and pivotal intervention with the man, earning the final connection; interiority concrete via pencil, headset sensations. Minor abstraction in "therapy-speak" patience at closure slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pulse patterns and listening density tighten from call to photo to man's revelation, landing Charged Poise closure in the hushed triad sitting together; orientation anchored in first paragraph, cost legible in "grief redialed his sleep."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and fogged gallery constrain navigation and guide pulses south; hearing aid as micro-setting charges choices and final thread, with glass remembering faces mirroring theme without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map currents for the child tightens via photo reversal (not impairment, habit) to man's grief, forcing narrator's agency in guiding dial; cost felt in child's swallow and man's unplugged phone, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Incidental heroism emerges organically from listening patterns and quiet connection, reweighting "finding" as process in final image without moralizing; resonance in ear-turned tenderness contrasts loud grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sparrow/light metaphors and biased noticing (quietest pattern) sustains single POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, child's sparrow-breath distinct from man's.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("steam sketches a question mark," "hummingbird caught under a jar") slightly muddles a mid-beat; no loops, rhythm modulates hush effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of necromantic contact tracing via hearing aid pulses transforms ghost story into tender mapping; risk in surreal rules (dead calls, pinging archive) coheres with organic closure.</comment>
