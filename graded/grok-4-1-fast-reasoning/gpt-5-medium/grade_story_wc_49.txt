<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowen's whimsical traits drive motivation through concrete actions like stringing the tendril and teaching songs, earning the collective change; narrator's embodied doubt softens via "corners of my doubts softened like bread meeting a warm palm." Internal conflict emerges in village's slipped rites vs. Rowen's remedies, but lacks sharper contradictory impulses in peak alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from Rowen's arrival to moonlit songs restoring echoes; orientation anchors immediately in arbor at dawn. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise lands cleanly in "the remedy took... reminded by moonlight of their making," with felt cost of collective patience foreclosing forgotten paths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant arbor constrains via dew-toned tendril and root-listening, charging final image of arbor's new calm; sensory details like "dew trembled into tone" filter through POV's gentle perception. No white-room; evolves from dawn hush to moonlit glow without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring practices tightens texturally to one-day countdown and moon alignment, forcing collective endurance; agency in practicing songs forecloses doubt with cost in "throats... polished with patience." Escalation coheres but lacks a single agency-driven reversal narrowing options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of alignment as consent emerges organically via particulars like hand-door agreement, reweighting premise in final "repair is sometimes just remembering together" without moralizing. Resonant CR charges closure image; recurring hush motif accumulates without token symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with perceptual bias ("time loosen... like bread meeting a warm palm") modulates rhythm under rising pressure; stable first-person/we POV avoids head-hopping. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual, like Rowen's "silence is a tool."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image-packed lines like "syllables like rain cautiously crossing stone"; no loops or scaffolds, but pervasive figurative density risks minor coherence strain in peak songs without dulling closure. Rhythm varies read-aloud, supporting lyric accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-songs restoring forgotten rites transforms ritual tropes via tendril-frame and moon consent; risk-taking in sustained lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from opening hush to closing hum.</comment>
