<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—personal hunger for perfect moment vs. duty to destabilize—culminating in earned printing choice with cost of rejecting mother's wish scaled to library's survival. Interiority concrete via embodied frost-reading and whisper-touch. Final renunciation of perfection feels character-particular, tied to backstory cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of frost-whisper-printing builds to RR closure where printed circle creates legible before/after (library flinches, perfection rejected). Cost explicit in "Perfection had been tasted, and rejected, because it weighed more than buoyancy." Single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (glass panes, cloud sea) constrains pivotal printing choice via buoyancy rules and frost patterns dictating alignment. Recurring frost and press charge final image of cataloged leaf. Sensory selection (feathered frost, rustling) reflects operator's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (print clause: quiver vs. sink) signaled early, escalates via lens-deepening (frost clause, rupture seam narrows to binary). Agency in lever-pull forecloses perfection path with on-page cost charging final asymmetry. Coherent pressure culminates in stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wobble over perfection emerges via shifting images (snowflake clauses trap symmetry; circle moment closes with sigh). Final image ("clause... wobble, murmur, agree, and float") reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature (frost as script, world via press lens) biased and particular. Rhythmic syntax modulates with intensity, purposeful compression taught early. No head-hopping; diction suits surreal expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors (frost braiding script, sea as teeth) cohere in pattern without muddle at peak printing beat ("platen kissed paper... circle closed with a sigh"). No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original surreal synthesis (printing reality-fruit in floating library) transforms fantasy tropes via specific operator stakes. Risky poetic compression heightens closure image inevitably. Non-obvious premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
