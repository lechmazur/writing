<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is poetically particular and consistent, with motivation to capture evolving into gentle escort via sea's question; contradictory impulses (ownership vs. passage) act in refusal to turn ("I refused to turn around"). Minor abstraction in embodiment prevents higher band, but closure renunciation earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of whispers/light builds to RR/Charged Poise in dream's release and map humming; cost legible in "some absences must remain luminous." Orientation anchored early (librarian/archipelago/dawns); continuous arc with no shards fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago and palette constrain choices (tracing routes, bleeding dawn) and charge final plates/maps; sensory selection (salt footprints, foam stitches) POV-biased and purposeful. Micro-setting (palette/camera) evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) deepens texturally via sea's interrogation ("what price...whose absence"), narrowing to renunciation with cost in luminous refusal. Agency in walking/photographing/escorting tightens pressure coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gentle pursuit emerges from particulars (dream's flight, cipher routes); final image ("filed...under Beginnings") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting possession as passage, with lingering ambiguity in ongoing wait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/smoke/breathing books) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation builds to hushed cadence at "I begin again." Stable first-person, no elision issues; prose reflects mind under poetic stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (unfurled letter, quivering fish) cohering around light; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. No artifacts dull closure image ("light dried like rain on slate").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian-dream photography in whispering isles transforms pursuit trope; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, with cipher/map as inevitable reconfiguration from particulars.</comment>
