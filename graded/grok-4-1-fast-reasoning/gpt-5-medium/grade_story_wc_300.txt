<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses (training's "isolate, calculate" vs. pulse's "listen, braid") embodied in hesitation beat; final conduit shift earned by shell confessions and pearl handling, foreclosing isolation career with felt shame/cost. No stock phrasing; voice-particular flaws drive micro-choices like pearl refusal then acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shell reading to pearl directive, culminating in on-page crowning (DC/RR) with legible cost (bunker unfit, career vow via silence). Orientation anchored early ("crystal caves...doomsday bunker inspector"); single scene, no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain climax (quartz spire as "finger held to lips" enables crowning); sensory hush/light lace mirrors internal shift, evolving causally post-pearl. POV bias filters (professional sensors off for "stillness"); micro-object (spire/pearl) charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify isolation vs. heart-dissolve) signaled early, tightens via hesitation "heartbeat" under Accumulative lens; crowning agency forecloses job path with visible cost (logged unfit, air shift). Minor abstractness in stakes pre-shell slightly mutes visceral punch before deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-to-communion emerges organically from confessions/pearl threading voices; final "door made of faces" reweights premise non-literally with ambiguity (unspent light). No moralizing; irony in inspector's "unspoken exits" charges resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with perceptual signature ("stone listened harder," "weather on your skin"); rhythm modulates from hush to "light inhaled," stable POV distance heightens intimacy. Experimental compression taught early, legible at crowning payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("light...threaded...every confession found a hallway"); metaphors coherent/patterned ("frozen rain," "latent radiance"). "Resonant hush" motif repeats purposefully without loop; minor figurative density borders overload in hesitation beat, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bunker audit as heart-audit via shell-etched confessions/pearl-seed transforms doomsday trope; risk in lyric sci-fi risks heightens stakes (safety vs. communion). Crowning turn inevitable from priors, no derivatives.</comment>
