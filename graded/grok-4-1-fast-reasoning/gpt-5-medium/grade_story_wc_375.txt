<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mnemonic gift enables lock recall but grief blocks action until creative pivot; contradictory survival (tourist sketches) vs. calling yields earned release with visible cost in rectified ledger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of cave memories tightens to charcoal sketch aligning tumblers—"drawn tumblers thrum"—yielding RR closure (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost of opened inner door; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal shards holding sketched faces constrain via remembered intentions and enable magical fix; cave glow charges final nod of relief, mirroring storage-to-action shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncork creativity vs. grief) signaled early, deepens via dial resistance forcing sketch agency; cost unmistakable in "gentle rain" release and commitment to sign pages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-for-action emerges via particulars; final image—"door beneath home"—reconfigures premise without moral, reweighting stranger portraits vs. fearless ones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person signature in face-as-streets perception and compression taught early; voice modulates sorrow to resolve without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion peaks in "black dust travels like pollen into the teeth"; zero loops, high density integrates figurative without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drawing lock via cave mnemonic synthesizes artist magic uniquely; risk of surreal cave pays off in inevitable creative fix, transforming trope.</comment>
