<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kindly methodical dweller's contradictory impulses peak vividly in "He wished to cough or tap, but fear is a lantern that reveals and burns," earning the endurance of unseen service as closure with felt cost of withheld visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise closure; tape's hum guides cache reveal with legible cost of remaining unseen in "He would not step into their gaze, not yet," no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vents, ducts, and pipe chases constrain crawls and choices throughout; recurring "sapphire hush" charges final image, with sensory bias (drafts, ticks) filtering dweller's hidden world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of indirect aid tightens accumulatively when tape/caches converge on notebook reveal, narrowing visibility options with agency in retreat; cost felt in affirmed renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unseen presence as visibility emerges organically from particulars like tape-hummed memories; final "presence could travel through ducts" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (metal itches, dustlavender) modulates rhythmically under pressure; girl's whisper carries subtext naturally, prose texture distinct and biased to dweller's seam-world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels with vivid rhythm ("shelves creak like old oaks"); minor figurative density in peak (tape "singing a faint itch") purposeful without muddle or loops, clarity intact at closure etchings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hidden dweller and sense-memory tape transforms helper trope; risk in lyrical compression heightens stakes of invisibility, inevitable in hindsight via chalk lattice closure.</comment>
