<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between bureau neutrality and mentor's duty act through micro-choices like pocketing the label and pausing at foundations; final radio call to gather residents is earned by accumulating photo discoveries, foreclosing expunging with felt cost to his role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo trail density builds to grove realization, reconfiguring stake from neutral patrol to preservation; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in gathering and "he will not expunge," with cost legible in defying bureau via "precisely humane care."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring "mirrored hush" and mud "patient bones" constrain choices (e.g., trail beckons down scoured blocks) and charge final image where "ridgeway and lake reflect each other"; sensory hierarchy (frogs' percussion slows) reflects warden's attuned perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (preserve vs. expunge) signaled early, deepens via napkin-map arrow to grove forcing stance crystallization; agency in radioing group narrows options under accumulative lens, with unmistakable cost in "tidies the stones" amid bureau orders.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stories holding "broken pieces" emerges implicitly from photo trail braiding voices into "careful rope of meaning"; final "past and surface hold a mirrored hush" resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (water motifs like "reservoir breathing") modulates rhythmically from hushed patrol to charged gathering; stable single POV biases details to levee warden's humane attunement, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection without loops (e.g., "pockets filling with paper ghosts and silt" propels); varied rhythm and purposeful figuratives like "foundations print the mud like patient bones" enhance propulsion, zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drought-resurfaced town and photo-trail memory preservation transforms ecological trope via warden's story-spinning duty; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at grove gathering.</comment>
