<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied thirst ("throat answered, thin and trembling") revealing contradictory impulses between past loud songs and present quiet patience; final hinge role earned via prior micro-choices like bolting the plate. Blind spots in shy rhymes compound realistically before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught graffiti encoding building to Charged Poise closure ("I was less a singer than a hinge"); orientation anchored early in courtyard/ghost setup. Cost legible in "failed... arrows crooked" patience shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring object (flower press plate) constrains choice (bolted as harp) and charges closure (presses signals); courtyard-as-body map integrates sensory details (steam valves blinking) purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate ghost's needs) tightens accumulatively via storm-driven encoding map, narrowing to city response; agency in bolting/tracing forces trade-off of personal song for translation, with failure costs visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden voices emerges organically from graffiti map/body metaphor, resonant non-literal answer in final hinge image reweighting listening as caretaking without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("notes walking softer than my feet," tastes of charged brass") with rhythmic modulation under storm pressure; stable first-person POV biases noticing toward echoes and patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (courtyard as lung/body) woven into action; minor patterned repetition ("between lightning and thunder") taught early without obscuring propulsion or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of code-ghost folklore with graffiti Morse and tinkersong transforms cyberpunk tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via storm's cadence without gimmickry.</comment>
