<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's attentive mysticism embodied in "attention is a candle in windy places" and micro-choices like naming car events; Mara's skepticism-to-belief arc earned via frost revelations with relational cost; distinct voices in dialogue and perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to Charged Poise closure—Mara's handprint match and whispered relief reconfigures premise with emotional cost legible in "bleak relief of someone finally believing her own weather."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and car frost constrain choices—arbor amplifies prism light, frost maps grief—charging final luminous image; sensory details (mist-shy fish, hoarfrost webs) selective via mystic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to convert Mara tightens accumulatively via deepening frost/prism images narrowing her doubt; agency in narrator's palm-naming and turning forces trade-off with her confronted grief as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of objects as witnesses emerges from frost mandala and prism handprint without statement; final "we decide afterward" reweights listening vs. shrugging organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct mystic perceptual signature ("emotions cling to edges") and rhythmic modulation under revelation pressure; sparse dialogue subtextual ("prayers are practical") advances goal; stable first-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (e.g., "truthful lies") taught early, no loops; minor figurative density in opening but propels accumulative texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grounded mysticism proving emotional absorption via frost/prism; risk-taking in poetic voice transforms superstition trope, inevitable in hindsight via arbor amplification.</comment>
