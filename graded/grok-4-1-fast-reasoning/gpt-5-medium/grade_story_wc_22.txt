<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coachman's traits—patience from coach-driving, ear for birds and dead tongues—embody motivation holistically, compelling endurance in planting ritual; micro-choices like thumbing pods reveal values without contradiction. Internal harmony over sharp conflict slightly tempers peak, but earned stasis in reclamation closes strongly. Closing lattice of bayonets as shelter exemplifies character-particular action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of seeding, bird-mapping, language builds to Charged Poise RR in "treaty tightening... narrow as mercy," reconfiguring growth as apology with patience's cost legible in final crossing. Continuous scene anchored early (coachman on jetty by para 2). No orientation debt; closure cost undeniable in foreclosed conquest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blooming jetty and battlefield constrain choices—salt-slick boards, bird-guided pits dictate seeding arcs—while recurring pods/shell ash charge final lattice image. Sensory selection (brine clatter, gull complaints) POV-biased to coachman's attuned ear. Environment evolves with action, mirroring reclamation without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclaiming battlefield) signaled early, accumulates texturally via bird/dead-tongue deepening that narrows forgetting soil; endurance agency forecloses conquest in bayonet lattice turn. Cost felt in "salting wounds... with sweetness." Minor abstractness in ghost-quieting tempers peak legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening over conquest emerges implicitly via pod-cracking and bird replies, culminating in non-literal RR answer: garden holds ghosts without dismissal. Subtext in "submerged concord" reweights premise via silt/hunger pact. Final image recharges particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: world via "syllables learned from chipped stones," diction/rhythm modulating lyric density to pressure (short bursts in seeding). No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("rustle like crows' feet," "tucks their spines"); metaphors coherent/patterned around brine/tongue without muddle. Minor stem repetition ("He [action]") in seeding beats but voice-motivated; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-reef coachman translates bird/dead languages to seed battlefield, transforming tropes (ruins reclamation) via "Phoenician... smells of rope." Risky lyricism heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight via pod whispers to jetty crossing.</comment>
