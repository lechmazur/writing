<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied peaks in "her voice rise through my ribs the way surf rises through stones," earning final endurance; subtle contradictory impulses (rusting questions vs. building) act in scene without alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("reverse migration... a tide that keeps time with absence"); orientation anchored early in station throat; cost legible in final seam/path etching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station, censer foot, and salt pans constrain choices (beacon points inland, foot aligns vowels); recurring foot charges final image; sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward tidal/memory cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating loss) signaled early, tightens via journey to shelter recognition under accumulative lens; agency in setting foot forecloses recovery illusion with felt absence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of recognition over recovery emerges via particulars (vowels align, needle settles in loss); final image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tides/memory metaphors) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from station pulse to inland quiet; POV stable, compression pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/openings; figurative density voice-motivated and consistent without muddle in closure ("compass will sleep... quiet as ash"); no loops or scaffolds dull peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-flood lyric navigation transforms loss tropes; reverse migration turn inevitable from calls/building particulars; risk in elliptical structure heightens resonance.</comment>
