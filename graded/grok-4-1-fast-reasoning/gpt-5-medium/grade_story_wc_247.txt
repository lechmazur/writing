<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arin's motivation to translate silence into music drives concrete micro-choices like signing questions to water and holding the clapper still; advisor applies subtle pressure via whispers that alter tactics. Contradictory impulses in "joyful sorrow" embody emotion without labels. Final endurance of absence feels earned through mappings, foreclosing forced melody.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mappings densify from sketches to hummed coordinates; orientation anchors early at luminous harbor. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands in "song remembers you" with conceptual cost of tuned forgetting legible in final bow. Persistent constraint of silence shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harbor details like "tide hummed like glass" and "moon run shivers" constrain choices (signing to pylons, bell rust) and charge final image of barnacle glitter. Sensory hierarchy reflects Arin's perceptual bias toward absences. Micro-setting of pier boards evolves tactilely with salt bloom and trembling cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens texturally via bell disruption that narrows options from quiet mapping to tide's cadence reply. Agency in releasing clapper forecloses obedient silence with felt cost in "glad and aching." Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-rhythm emerges organically from particulars like pencil marks washing thinner; final image of empty camera as "bell of unstruck light" reweights premise without moral. Subtext in advisor's whispers invites ambiguity on memory's pitch. Resonance inextricable from Arin's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tracing absences (gull shadows, rope sighs); rhythmic syntax modulates from quiet gestures to trembling cadence. No head-hopping; voice poetic yet controlled, biased toward dialects of silence. Elisions purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "ring through milk" propelling rhythm; varied syntax avoids monotony. Purposeful figurative density taught as mapping pattern pays off without muddle in peak mapping beats. Minor synonym churn in "silence" repetitions purposeful, not looped.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language mapping silence with empty camera as metronome transforms lyric trope into indispensable constraint. Risk in non-causal texture heightens stakes of absence without gimmickry. Final city-harbor pocket inevitable from particulars.</comment>
