<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the precise tail cut amid suppressed rage ("I did not invite rage; I invited precision"), earning the final self-reconfiguration with embodied cost in shaky hands and bent convictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure in the relics tray ("Two small relics of belief, distinct in how they refused to heal"), with undeniable conceptual cost reweighting certainty as predator.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Misty workshop under stars constrains choices via atomizer mist as "counsel" during surgery and charges final image as it thins, embodying perceptual narrowing under nocturnal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstructing ecology/self tightens texturally through parallel shedding (toys, tail, ornament), forcing trade-off in donor letter's restraint; cost legible in "hope is hungry" amid hollow accounts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shedding to honest shape emerges organically from terrarium purge to relic placement, offering non-literal resonant answer in "certainty is a predator, and doubt a steward" that reweights prior broker deception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("every bottle became quietly vivid") and rhythmic modulation under stress (short breaths mirror syntax compression during cut) sustain first-person stability without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical propulsion with varied rhythm shines in surgery beat, but minor figurative density overload ("tail like a question... tiny omened seed") in peak risks coherence without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shelter con via chameleon tail relic parallel transforms tropes of betrayal into specific shedding ecology, with bold poetic risk heightening stakes in nocturnal reconstruction.</comment>
