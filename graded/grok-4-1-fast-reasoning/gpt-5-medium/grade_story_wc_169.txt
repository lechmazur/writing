<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between buoyancy and ballast act in scene through pattern adjustments and needle readings, earning the final choreography recognition with visible village-scale cost. Interiority particular via gauge inheritance and timeline trades. No unearned epiphanies; competence balanced by shared failures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density builds to gauge's steady angle and tide's careful climb, delivering Charged Poise closure with legible cost in foreclosed imbalance. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one continuous scene fits scope. Cost proof: "leaning together without falling" reconfigures options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto constrains via tide pulses touching spirals and climbing walls, charging final cradle of gauge on village path. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: possibility in needle quivers, obsidian water mirrors selves. Micro-objects (shells, ribbons) evolve causally, mirroring internal equipoise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hope equations) signaled early tightens via chorus collaborations narrowing to steady needle, forcing calibration trade-off under Accumulative lens. Agency in balloon trades and pattern tweaks drives escalation; cost unmistakable in ballast necessity felt at "posture of leaning together."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of calibrated hope emerges organically from balloon exchanges and isobar ribbons, answered non-literally by stars lowering and days tipping—reweighting prior sleepwalker malaise without moralizing. Particulars like shared diagram avoid platitudes; ambiguity in serene swell invites counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("needle making a hush of steps," "sea climbed... left stones shining like answers") biases toward pattern-reading; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure without elision. Single POV stable, prose syntax reflects watchful mind. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density with multi-job lines (e.g., "breathed into a bladder, sealed it, affixed... released" propels action while texturing). Metaphors coherent (tide as reader); rhythm varies for cathedral calm to swell. Closure image propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of balloonist gauge, timeline seams, and decorative math transforms ritual into physics of hope; risk in lyric congress of selves heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via gauge reprise. No template echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
