<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Helix-minded trait shown through spiral thinking and micro-choices like etching copper traces and pulsing light, with embodied contradiction in "calm panic of recognition"; final endurance of shattered mirror earns transformation without tidy epiphany. Minor abstractness in motivation phrasing ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") tempers perfection, but impulses act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses densify visions/quakes to Charged Poise closure in "mirror split a final time... wider field of view," reconfiguring fear to trust with legible cost of unwound logic. Single scene anchored early ("moonlit canyon... broken periscope mirror"); no orientation debt. One tightening via quake cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Canyon as micro-setting constrains ritual ("shelf of limestone... canyon an amplifier"), charges final seam opening; mica/cricket details filter via engineer POV, evolve with quake. Body/mirror as recurring objects shape pulses and ending image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover entangled dreams) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via three pulses narrowing to shared-body vision and quake; agency in "modify my own circuitry" forecloses erasure path with rearrangement cost. Minor abstract stakes legibility pulls from 9-band, but pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of tending memory seams emerges organically from pulses/abandoned shapes, resonant in final "pathways... where futures and fossils converse" reweighting premise without moralizing. Returning helix/mirror images shift via quake without token recurrence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (circuits, antennae, noise-as-secrets) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in pulse visions ("field within me rearranged like birds"); stable single-POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short quake sentences accelerate); density high, but figurative overload in pulse beats ("braided by proximity... neuronal tide") borders coherence strain without full payoff, docking from high-band. No loops/scaffold; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineer-archeologist frame transforms memory trope via periscope-helix entanglement, inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric ritual heightens stakes, no derivative echoes.</comment>
