<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied contradiction in heretic valve-nudging using grandmother's key amid fear of drift; final renunciation (note to foreman) earned by rising pressure on Basin Three lag, foreclosing correction path with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from lag notice to CR closure ("clocks measured... razor edges where one state cut into another"); orientation anchored early (station, night watch post-whistle); cost legible in bleeding finger's "crescent" on key marking severance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (drip pressure, gauge razors, fjord hush filtering professional eye); basin and beacon constrain choices (squint verification, pulse-matching); final catwalk reflection charges closure image with fjord's bass hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("understand what clocks really measure") signaled early, deepens texturally via lag adjustment to pulse-sync; agency in attention/renunciation tightens options, with felt cost in fingertip nick altering tactics to realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as "razor edges" emerges organically from particulars (gauge cut, drop hesitation, beacon blink); final image ("exactly placed at the edge") reweights premise with conceptual cost of severance, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (tidepool-crab care, seawater pulse) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in closure's knit darkness; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "needle crept, shy of the painted tick"); figurative language consistent in lyric pattern without muddle, though minor metaphor density in reflection beats; no loops obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydraulic clocks, mantle key, fjord station into edge-metaphor premise; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes on time's obedience without gimmickry.</comment>
