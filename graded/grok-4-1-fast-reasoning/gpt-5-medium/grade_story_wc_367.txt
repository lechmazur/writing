<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to shape dawn via shadows roots prophetic laughter and endurance against melancholy sea, embodied in "laughter feels like ballast." Child's integration adds relational pressure via shared steering, but her symbolic arrival dilutes individual flaws. Contradictory impulses (joy vs. tilt into melancholy) act in scene, earning final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of routines and images builds to CR closure in "sea kept printing us in phosphor and wind," reweighting post-newspaper premise with conceptual cost of endured shadows. Orientation anchors early ("Emerald lighthouse under stars"). No shards or ambiguity; pattern taught immediately pays off at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald glass foundation and lantern wick constrain choices, mirroring internal states and charging final image ("emerald vow to tomorrow"). Sensory hierarchy (light roaring, storm breath as memory) filters via POV urgency. Details evolve causally with nightly routine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of steering light amid post-print silence tightens accumulatively via prophetic crate arrival and child-training, forcing endurance trade-off. Agency in feeding storm names and bending beam narrows options with felt cost (tilting into melancholy). Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of weathered joy emerges from particulars (jokes becoming prophecy, beam as news), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Subtext in storm laughter and child’s drawings invites ambiguity on tomorrow's probabilities. Resonance inextricable from narrator's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows still knew how to speak," "light tumbles down mirror angles") biases toward prophetic lyricism, stable in first-person. Rhythm modulates with intensity; no head-hopping or withhold. Prose reflects mind under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, motifs like total internal reflection patterned early without loops. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors ("thunder grins first") slightly muddles peak storm beat, but read-aloud rhythm varies. No scaffolds; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse as post-newspaper "newsroom of two," transforming prophecy trope via grease-pencil motive and kelp-child. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; final reconfiguration ("door swings on laughter") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
