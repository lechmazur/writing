<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in persistent question drives mural creation with embodied sensory details like scents and drafts; interiority particular via postcard readings and loft epiphany. Quiet endurance of months-long process shows credible change with felt time cost. No contradictory impulses in peak but micro-choices like grinding pigments reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory layers densify from window study to fair unveiling; orientation anchored early in studio/cathedral. Conceptual Repricing closure in final postcard ("night is the gentlest daylight") reconfigures premise with undeniable effort cost across seasons. No orientation debt; pattern taught via vignettes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Etched glass layers constrain observation and scent perception in loft ("draft braided itself through the glass layers"), charging realization; sensory hierarchy (scent/silence over sight) reflects artist's bias. Pavilion amber filters light into panels at climax. Recurrent vines/moons evolve causally with mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding night blooming) signaled in opening question, tightens texturally via loft hinge ("new mural unfolded inside me") narrowing to artistic proof. Pressure coheres accumulatively to fair Charged Poise; cost legible in sustained labor ("months... leaves turned copper"). Agency in persistent painting amid seasons.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of night's courtship emerges via particulars like tobacco scent and moth processions, resonant in final image of murals as doors reweighting "why flowers bloom at night." No moralizing; grandmother's note obliquely answers without statement. Subtext in layered silences invites rereading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing ("hush move under it like a cat"); rhythmic control modulates from meditative to charged fair scene. Single POV stable, lyric compression taught early via postcards pays off in closure. No head-hopping; diction fits artist's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "street below wavered into a negative"); metaphors coherent around layers/petals without muddle in peak fair beat. Minor "hush" recurrence pattern-taught as motif; rhythm varies read-aloud. No loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical inquiry, stained glass optics, and mural as perceptual door; risk in poetic shards heightens textural stakes. Postcard lineage transforms artist trope organically. Final reconfiguration ("murals were doors") inevitable from vine/light particulars.</comment>
