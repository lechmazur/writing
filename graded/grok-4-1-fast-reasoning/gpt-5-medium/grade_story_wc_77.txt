<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear of non-existence unless observed) act in scene via unbosoming truth, earning final name reclamation with visible cost of sealed exit. Advisor distinct via idiom ("fear owes me money") and pressure. Internal voice coherent, embodied (ribs clicking, chest ticked).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: paradox density builds to shadow confrontation and photographic capture as RR/Charged Poise, reconfiguring fear with cost (sealed mouth). Causal links clear (clasp opens, dictionary traps). Orientation anchored early ("midway smelled like rain rolled in mothballs").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Funhouse constrains choices (plywood lips lock, mirrors distort); recurring luminance charges final escape image ("slit of daylight disguised"). Sensory selective/POV-biased (afterglow crawling like algae reflects curse). No white-room; tactile (wet sigh).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear) signaled early, escalates via agency (write paradox, photograph) under Accumulative lens, tightening to shadow's confession and cost-legible escape (clasp workaround). One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (unswerving gaze sutures fear) emerges via paradox/shadow bile, resonant non-literal answer in final image (name swims back via camera). No moralizing; complexity in fear's resentment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (photographic curse shapes mirrors as "new negatives"); rhythm modulates stress (short sentences in corridor). Dialogue subtextual ("fear owes me money"); stable first-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; figurative coherent/pattern-taught (bruises, algae) without muddle in peak (shadow bleed). Minor paraphrase potential ("breathed like a gill") but propels. No loops/scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: carnival surrealism + paradox dictionary tricks fear via photographic curse; risk-taking (nonlinear dream logic) heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight (shadow gags on door).</comment>
