<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority deeply embodied and particular—barefoot soles reading "careful letters," cheek to glass listening to "not ticking"—reveals contradictory tenderness beneath shame; final apology and endurance of the dream's ache earned through scene impulses. Voice-specific traits like gentle handling constrain choices without labels. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices hierarchize values culminating in ledger closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/reflective density builds from vow "to listen until the abandoned dream could sit beside him" to finch-tilt recognition and final cheek-to-glass poise, delivering Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of perpetual "meeting" legible in "both weathers would count as music." Orientation anchors instantly; single scene coherence perfect, no micro turns beyond lyric deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting as micro-world constrains and charges: crystal forecourt's "jeweled droplets" and "rippling answer" to finch mirror internal hush, barefoot tactility writes "letters on his soles" that evolve to carry "clean syllables" of apology. Sensory hierarchy (petrichor, rainlight veins) POV-biased toward quiet; final sanctuary return recharges with "tide before surge," indispensable to closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriending dream's ache) signaled in opening vow, escalates via textural deepening—finch as "conductor," apology whisper—forces stance crystallization in non-renunciation; cost unmistakable in foreclosed "city of bells" path, felt as ribs turning "from marble to water." Agency in sustained listening narrows to acceptance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "keep meeting it, without demand" emerges organically from particulars—blank notations holding silence, finch posture as kin—reweighting prior fleeing/shame into resonant "weather" image without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (ledger close) and implication (not winding clocks) invites ambiguity of ongoing ache; final line non-literal answer recharges hush motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("glacial hush no book had ever held," "origami thunder") biases toward auditory absence, stable close third-person POV with rhythmic modulation swelling to closure poise; compression taught early as "measures designed to hold a silence." No head-hopping; diction reflects introverted scribe's tender lexicon under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm—short finch sentences tension long reflective flows—but pervasive figurative layering ("news carried by ants," "rainlight clung to crystal veins") borders coherence slip in peak realization beat without muddle. Minor hush repetitions purposeful; no loops, scaffold, or template cadence dull closure's "tide before surge" propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of clock scribe's "soundless sanctuary" transforms regret trope into tactile hush-making, with forecourt's post-rain crystals evolving from memory-echo to apology-conduit; bold lyric risk (barefoot letters, not-ticking poise) heightens stakes inevitably, no derivative echoes.</comment>
