<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince's characterization shines in embodied contradictions like "bitterly sweet" tenderness amid conquest upbringing, with micro-choices (scavenging, fasting) earning the shift to caretaking; internal voice particular and pressure-tested without diagnostic slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from egg rescue to cradle assembly and hatching; closure as Charged Poise in Dawnspoke's emergence reconfigures lineage with felt cost ("brittle armor of his upbringing slide away"), on-page and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains via palace shudders guiding cradle rhythm and balcony gusts brushing murals; recurring stalactite sighs and iron forests charge final sway, with sensory hierarchy (hums, trembles) mirroring internal repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) tightens texturally through hypothesizing-to-assembly deepening, forcing trade-offs like fasting; cost legible in gears' complaints yielding to song, agency in prince's listening crystallizing stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending flawed genesis emerges organically from egg-to-Dawnspoke arc, reweighting conquest via resonant images like rust-grown petals; final image answers repair-over-undoing without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "choosing" creature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing shell memory, wire storms); rhythmic lyric voice modulates pressure, purposeful compression taught early and legible at hatching payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload ("speckled as frostbite, warm as remembered lullabies") borders coherence strain in hatching beat; no loops, strong propulsion despite minor repetition of "tremor."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical world hatched by organic repair, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation transforming tropes; Dawnspoke's "crossroads given breath" feels inevitable from prince's particular reverie.</comment>
