<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's consistent observational drive and refusal of the diamond earn a meaningful renunciation with visible personal cost ("no richer, but steadier"), revealing hierarchy of values through micro-choices like camping in the office and charting nodes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through motivated ellipsis (observation → shredder discovery → reassembly → revelation), with on-page Conceptual Repricing at ending where teaching caretakers reconfigures myth to maintenance and cost is legible in the "liability" line and narrator's steadiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Diamond as recurring object constrains choices (chimes during storm, tuned with wrench) and charges final image under eaves; sensory hierarchy (dust storms scouring leaves, pear blossoms in letters) filters through POV's precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavate truth) signaled early tightens via reassembly beat that narrows options from rumor to resonator design; agency in teaching forces trade-off with caretakers' bristling, cost unmistakable in foreclosed cosmic fairness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection as utility emerges organically from diamond's flawed lattice and "liability exceeds goodwill" line, with final image of recalibrated air and stakes offering resonant non-literal answer that reweights prior rumors without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("intuited design," objects outliving policies) biases noticing toward precise timbres and lattices; rhythmic control modulates from storm intensity to dawn marking, with stable first-person distance enhancing intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("dust storm came like a herd of hammers") without loops or muddle; figurative coherence (fruit as "stubborn lanterns") supports voice without obscuring closure image of "orchards that learned to speak."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc orchard with synthetic resonator seed transforms curse trope via math-anchored calm; risky poetic compression heightens stakes in revelation without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight from early diamond setup.</comment>
