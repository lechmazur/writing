<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (protecting self via ambiguity vs. disorienting fear) act in the final confession proof, earning the closure renunciation with embodied cost in the halo's cooling and press shudder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing in the final broadside question and new star blank, reweighting grief-editing premise with conceptual cost; orientation waived as deliberate disorientation charges the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Topaz dust, oil-citrus smells, and halo fragment constrain printing choices and charge the final windowsill image; sensory hierarchy reflects operator's perceptual bias, evolving with events like fragment's glow variations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of emotion) deepens via couple's piece then self-confession under Accumulative lens, narrowing to stance crystallization; cost legible in "distance between cruelty and mercy in points and picas" that invites without arriving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transposed empathy emerges organically from printing acts and couple's arithmetic terror/love, resonant non-literal answer in final question reweighting sky grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses printing idiom (ligatures, picas) with cosmic perception; rhythmic control modulates from patient spacing to shuddering press under pressure, POV stable and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern taught early (metal logic to breath); no loops, propulsion varies rhythmically, zero artifacts dulling closure image of fragment drinking vanished light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress as empathy conduction with halo/topaz under vanishing stars feels inevitable; risk-taking in lucid turbulence heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
