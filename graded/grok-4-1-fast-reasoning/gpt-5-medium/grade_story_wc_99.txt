<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's bonsai tutor traits root motivation deeply, with contradictory impulses like "obedience is the way fear pretends to be careful" acting in scene to compel tracing the lace. Interiority embodied concretely ("knots between my ribs," "hands learned only drift"); final renunciation to teach by listening earned via causal buildup. Minor reflection exceeds BRR slightly but anchors to present cues without flattening; no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motifs (compass ticks, lace tracing) builds to Charged Poise closure where speaking words and folding lace reconfigures stance, with cost legible in "trimmed of their thorns" and steadied moon compass. Orientation anchors early ("breezy islet after rain," bonsai tutor post-severance). Single scene, no shards; lens unambiguous at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (salt grass paths, casuarina whispers, driftwood "posture of those twisted trunks") filter through POV's pruning lens, constraining path and charging final cove image. Micro-settings (flat black rock, wet sand) evolve causally, mirroring internal states via lace drinking reflections. Environment pressures choices (walk clockwise, tides rising); no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find color of apologies) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lace reading and tide pull, narrowing to speaking with trade-off cost ("set them to drift" forecloses silence). Agency in obedience-then-renunciation tightens under lens; moral calculus between discipline and honesty sharpens peak. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak, but closure charges undeniably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pruning regret vs. natural leaning emerges organically from bonsai/tide motifs, reweighted non-literally in final image of diffusing blue instruction to students. Subtext in silences/gestures (gull cocked, no applause); ambiguity lingers without confusion. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like cerulean glow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pruning syntax ("prune storms into miniatures," "trimmed of their thorns") biases noticing, stable first-person distance modulates with intensity. Rhythmic control under stress (short sentences at speaking: "I spoke... The sea accepted"); purposeful lyric compression taught early, paid in closure. Minimal dialogue natural to gull moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: multi-job lines integrate image/action (compass "clicked like a throbbing tooth"). Metaphors consistent/patterned (lungs, pupils), no muddle in peak; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor repetition ("rhythmically placid") purposeful motif, not loop; template cadence absent, but occasional elevated diction nudges from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai discipline, lace navigation, cerulean apologies transforms regret trope via specific islet logic. Risky lyric frame heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration ("show them the compass, and the lace, and the cove") inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
