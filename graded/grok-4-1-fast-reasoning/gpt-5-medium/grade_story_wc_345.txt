<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Collective "we" embodies contradictory hope and argument effectively, with micro-choices like sharing barrels earning unity; Lio's traits compel reliance without individual depth slip touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as bell/chalk gifts densify to crisis braid and nebula poise; "one long, dissolving ring" delivers RR closure with shared hunger cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain rescue ("snapping branches and slicing ladders") and charge final air-river launch; wind "in our teeth" sensory anchors POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Disunity stake tightens via arch crisis, forcing collective pairings with raw hands cost; agency in orchestrated effort culminates in nebula reveal under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nebula "only shows to people who are tired together" reweights brambled quarrels non-literally via apologies traded "like seeds"; final sigh resonates without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in plural POV, perceptual bias in "winds we learned to feel in our teeth"; rhythm heightens from "gnarl our hope" to mist oath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density in "braided alarm that braided us," varied rhythm propels; minor figural density (e.g., "map vines") coherent without closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost wind-orchestration and chalk dawn messages synthesize unity premise freshly; arch drift to air-raft payoff feels inevitable.</comment>
