<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Collective "we" shows embodied uncertainty turning to synced bravery, with guard's tears and badge removal revealing individual change under pressure. Poet's motivation to stride boundaries compels group micro-choices like breathing together. Lacks sharper internal contradictions in pivotal sync beat, but final step earns via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whispers to synced breaths to lake-step, yielding Charged Poise RR at "we follow... boundary dissolves responsibly." Orientation anchors in first stanza (atrium, lake, post-ban). Persistent fear as conceptual cost legible in final "certainty trembles... fertile."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium's ribs and quartz constrain via responsive hum that "tunes itself to the pulse," charging final "continuous hand on our backs." Frozen lake evolves (cracks stanza), mirroring internal thaw. Sensory weave (mineral air, wingbeat hush) filters through collective awe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cross boundaries post-ban) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via breath-sync tightening to group step, narrowing fear-option with guard's turn. Agency in poet's invitations forces collective stance; cost in "fear lingers like cautionary hand" felt at climax lake-crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gentle mingling vs. fear emerges via paraphrased decrees and dissolving chalk lines, reweighting "Keep apart" premise non-literally. Final image braids voices into "listening," offering resonant answer to boundary sacredness without moral. Counter-readings (lingering fear) add complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in collective "we" POV, perceptual signature in biased noticing (throats, wingbeats). Rhythm modulates from hush to crescendo; poet's speech distinct via wind-translation. Elisions (childhood shadow-writing) anchor to present touch, paid at stride.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud (short hush beats to long hum sentences); density high, motifs like hush integrate without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops ("dissolving boundaries") taught early as pattern, but slight scaffold in repeated "tremor" dulls peak sync. No closure artifacts; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-ban lyric ritual via quartz pulses and poet's scarf, transforming threshold tropes through tactile certainty. Risky collective POV heightens communal stakes; final fertile tremble inevitable from seeded images.</comment>
