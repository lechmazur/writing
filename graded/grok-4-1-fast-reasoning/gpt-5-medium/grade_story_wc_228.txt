<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of fear and vow act in cave choices like path by smell and dipping shell; final renunciation of staying earns stasis with cost of leaving the chamber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to RR (Charged Poise in painting curve and backing away); pool quiver and corridor light mark tightening with conceptual cost of transience legible in "passage that lasts only once."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cave's slick alphabet, brine-smoke paths, and oasis pool constrain choices and charge final image; quince-scented air mirrors internal split without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vow-keeping tightens via wrong turn deepening self-confrontation; agency in shell-dipping forecloses immersion with cost of corridor closing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of promises vs. copies emerges via mirror/pool/painting images; final easel setup reconfigures "temporary eternity" non-literally as harbor's breath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with painterly perceptual bias in "tidal shards" and "mineral syllables"; rhythmic compression heightens cave pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; dense lines like "lacquer catches hints of light" propel via varied syntax, charging closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tide-painted cave walls and shell-boat synthesize painterly quest freshly; wrong-turn method risks lyric boldness, heightening closure stakes organically.</comment>
