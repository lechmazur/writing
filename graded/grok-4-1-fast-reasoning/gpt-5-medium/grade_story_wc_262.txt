<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in warehouse visualization of feelings as mislabeled aisles, particular to her spatial imagination; contradictory impulses peak when she finds her own name on a shelf, compelling the earned act of writing "stay" with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure in her writing the new letter and marking the shelf; cost legible in "the life she had shelved," reconfiguring her premise without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Projection booth constrains choices via projector for muscle memory and letters behind screen; recurring projector exhales at end, charging final image; sensory hush mirrors internal warehouse fog purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find unused love tightens texturally when her own box appears, narrowing to self-realization; agency in psychometry forecloses expert detachment with felt cost of shyness-aged conversation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unused love as overqualified warehouse emerges organically; final image of letters as thresholds to "stay" offers resonant reconfiguration of "breath before yes," reweighting prior realizations without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in spatial metaphors like "doors ajar like vowels"; rhythmic control modulates from hushed to thunderous, heightening pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (warehouse shelves, eggs hatching); zero loops, propulsion via varying rhythm; no artifacts dull closure image of projector exhaling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry in film booth transforms relic tropes; risk in lyric warehouse conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via her self-named shelf discovery.</comment>
