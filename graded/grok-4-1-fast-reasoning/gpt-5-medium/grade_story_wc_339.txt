<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete, contradictory impulses (e.g., "mother the past than to repair it") embodied in micro-choices like rounding letters; final renunciation of the ship earns stasis through prior analytic patience under death's familiarity. Minor abstract phrasing in epiphanies avoids full 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final lines ("ship fell away like a thought relinquished... time for air and sorrow"), cost legible in breath/time; single scene oriented early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snow globe and rope line constrain choices (tug response, pocketing) and charge final image; sensory details (silted chairs, drowned lung logbook) selectively mirror internal surrender, vivid without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, textural escalation via deepening observations tightens to tug/renunciation with felt cost in drift vs. weight; entering 8.8+ gate met narrowly as trade-off charges poise without decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of surrender emerges organically from particulars (Morse prayers, flakes hesitate); final image reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost, no moralizing or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (analytic patience filtering ruin as "alphabet") with rhythmic modulation under subtle pressure; stable close-third POV, purposeful compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied syntax propels contemplative rhythm; coherent metaphors (capillary in glass) enhance without muddle, even in peak reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart aftermath in sunken library with snow globe as evolving anchor transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes toward CR without gimmickry.</comment>
