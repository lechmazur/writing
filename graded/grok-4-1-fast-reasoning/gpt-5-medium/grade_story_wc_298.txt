<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's reckless idealist drive compels soul-patching via barter, embodied in tasting ash and kindness as blade; contradictory impulses peak in fiercely gentle trade with boy, earning seam-closing change with story-cost. Boy's cindery eyes and iron shoes reveal under pressure. Minor abstraction in emotions avoids peak diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density (roots, ash-map) builds to barter climax, closure as Charged Poise in orchard shiver and seed-tending with irreplaceable story-cost ("plant what you will never keep"). Orientation anchored by ~100 words in market ribs. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots-between-bones constrain path to pit/boy and charge closure-planting; brass light, bone-chimes selective via POV urgency. Sensory hierarchy (soot-taste, lantern honey) mirrors internal states without overt symbol. Spatial choreography clear from stairs to pit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul-patching) signaled early, escalates via Weaver's task/map to boy-trade under Accumulative lens: ripple/hiss pattern-break narrows to debt-choice, agency in promise/trammel forecloses iron path with felt name/story costs. Boy's laugh forces deepening. Moral calculus in kindness vs. refusal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed growth/mercy emerges via barter particulars, subtext in Weaver's smile-without-teeth and bone-hand; final seed-scattering reweights premise non-literally with cost, inextricable from arc. No tidy moral, ambiguity in "foolishness learned to hold breath."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (shadows inlay meaning, ash-taste) biases noticing; voice rhythm modulates from market-breath to closure hush, stable first-person. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Your card has teeth"), advances plot. No head-hopping, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; metaphors consistent (ash-map ripples) without muddle in peaks. Minor figurative density in trade beat taught early as lyric pattern, pays off clean. No loops, scaffold; final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fate-barter in bone-orchard transforms tropes via ash-card mechanics and kindness-trammel; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in seed-debt. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
