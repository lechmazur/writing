<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (tremble yet adapt) act in decryption and climb; final vulnerability embrace earned by bone-date recall and reunion choice with relational cost. Interiority concrete via phobia catalog and breath counts. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("transformative betrayal") unembodied but doesn't flatten peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cast cipher to box to roof reunion; RR closure in "unlocked our shared name" reconfigures betrayal with emotional hinge cost legible in "apologized without excuses." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library stacks, skylight ladder, cast constrain choices (tracing, climbing); shell as micro-setting charges decryption and final heartbeat sync. Sensory hierarchy (iron groans, shell tidebreath) reflects stunt-phobia bias; stars evolve to frame roof Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vulnerability as power) signaled early, tightens via cipher deepening knowledge; agency in decryption/climb narrows options under lens. Cost unmistakable in breath break/reknit before planning; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Betrayal-to-trust arc emerges via cast notes shifting to "make him real"; final cast-tracing image non-literally answers vulnerability question, reweighting premise without moral. Ambiguity in brother's intent lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (fears as "cataloged injuries," iron sibilants) biases noticing; poetic rhythm modulates from tremble to "braid into promise." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual; stable first-person distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Fear could be a lever, not a lock"); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor overwrite in "It said" paraphrase loop (−0.4); metaphors consistent nautical/iron pattern without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stunt-double identity swap + child-cast ciphers fresh synthesis; poetic voice transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight via shell/library whispers charging roof poise.</comment>
