<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chaplain's interior mirrors thorn in heart to Jonah's jaw-clench, embodying contradictory listening burden and repair hope; Jonah's braced failure yields earned nod via prior causality, confronting flaw with micro-choice cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern density (gears/teeth, light/storms) tightens to CR closure: "apology became a map of steps he could deserve," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of rhythmic action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring "light breaks through storm clouds" motif constrains counsel and charges final chapel image, evolving from shop lamp sparks to windows guiding Jonah's stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of rhythmic repair deepens accumulatively via thorn extraction paralleling doubt, forcing endurance in Jonah's breath-sync and nod without mercy-begging, with legible cost of small-step choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final booth hush reconfigures guilt-as-gravity via ticking alignment, offering non-literal answer to redemption-through-action without moralizing; emerges from heart/light particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual bias ("wounded melodies," "thorn of bent metal") and dialogue subtext (proprietor's riddles) sustain rhythmic control; elisions (Jonah backstory) anchor to present cues, paid in closure nod.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("tilted the heart to his ear"); varied syntax propels to peak "vibrant hush" without loops or muddled metaphors touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poetic synthesis of clockwork redemption via "heart... would not wind" transforms prison trope, risking lyric density that heightens stakes organically to charged booth image.</comment>
