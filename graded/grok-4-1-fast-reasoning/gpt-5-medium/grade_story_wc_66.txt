<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Copyist's diligent traits root motivation in concrete habits like numbering rests, intensifying to tapping pencil and promising tempo; contradictory caution versus engagement acts in scene via measured devotion amid brittle voices. Final promise earned by prior micro-choices with visible cost of secrecy. No unembodied epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tuning radio seeds density increase in dust animation, tightening at broadcast's response to pencil tap narrowing to paced phrasing. Closure as Charged Poise in "cadence marker within my ribs" reconfigures silence-telling with promise cost legible on page ("leave a score wherever ash settled"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember alcove, dust, ash constrain choices (scattering ash forms letters, floor murmurs as plot points) and charge final image (dust fluent, breathing measure). Sensory hierarchy musical/POV-specific (radio hiss as teapot, needle-snow). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach dust stories) signaled early, escalates texturally via lyric density to dust curling into letters; agency in copying/tapping forces trade-off of hidden glow for animation. Cost unmistakable in promise foreclosing open broadcast, charging poise. One tightening sufficient, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of breath-hinged stories from ash emerges organically via raking cinders into vowels; final image ("dreamt my careful pages turning themselves") offers resonant CR reweighting famine-premise without moral. Subtext in silences offering skeletons; complexity in brittle voices lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (notation everywhere: barlines as spider threads, common time in smolder) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (verses descend like scaffolding). Stable single-POV, no leakage; elisions (broadcast origin) taught early, paid in hidden choir.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punchy lines peak at dust animation); high density, purposeful musical metaphors taught early without muddle in closure ("ribs" cadence marker clear). Minor figurative density in animation beat ("shapes gathered... silhouettes") borders overwrite but supports textural lens; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pirate lyrics scoring fog/ash transforms post-famine trope into fresh notation-dance synthesis; risk of lyric compression heightens stakes in hidden glow without gimmick. Final reconfiguration inevitable from copyist habits; no derivative echoes.</comment>
