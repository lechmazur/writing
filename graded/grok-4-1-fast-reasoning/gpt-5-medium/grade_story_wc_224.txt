<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory denial of accent burial and thunder's assent act simultaneously; stone's "courtyard of cracked jars" vision earns final voicing with silencing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density tightens from lantern path to stone warmth, culminating in CR where "true hello" reconfigures home with buried-voice cost legible in mountain's answer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shifting shelves and "question mark" corridor constrain navigation, charging closure door; smells of "old rivers and flint" filter through protagonist's disoriented perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake signaled in "map my lost rooms" deepens via stone's accent revelation, forcing trade-off in seeding tongue over silence; cost visible in moving "shame-encyclopedias."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vowel-house mirror offers non-literal answer to home's shape, reweighting buried talents through "courtyard...now whole" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "names flake from the tongue" biases noticing; seer's "We read via the texture of a feather" carries subtext, voice modulating to "gritty...permission" under shift-stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "lantern burned thin"; metaphors like "mercury...trembled" cohere without muddle, rhythm exhaling with mountain's "patient...bellows."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bookstore-mountain with "substitutes reality nightly" synthesizes fresh frame; stone-feather seeding risks poetic ingenuity, inevitable in "cartography of forgiven mistakes."</comment>
