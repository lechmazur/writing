<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between flight and surrender act vividly in the gliding along puddles and grain-by-grain lowering; final renunciation earned by procedural steps and timeline visions foreclosing height-conquest with felt cost of patience. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in shadow refusal and bone commands. No diagnostic labels; flaws like periodic eternity drive struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tablet seed to aligned runes at middle arch, culminating in CR via lowering and erasure that reweights premise with undeniable cost of surrendered flight. Orientation anchored early in viaduct post-rain; one tightening via handwriting message narrows to ground-truth. No ambiguity; cost legible in "lowered, a grain at a time."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Viaduct's slick neon puddles constrain gliding choices and charge final erasure; recurring rainlight reflections mirror internal timelines, integrated via goal-directed perception. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (cooled wires, wet stone); no white-room, evolves causally with rearrangements. Body as micro-setting in toe-kiss anchors closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquer labyrinth via retrace) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through tuned timelines and branch visions narrowing to message-driven lowering; agency in following pattern forecloses flight-path with on-page cost of "subtraction made room." Pressure coheres, one decisive deepening at arch recognition. Moral calculus in height vs. ground sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-over-conquest emerges organically from procedural paths and final flat labyrinth realization, reweighting prior flight-insistence without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in shadow's witness and loosened instant. Particulars like handwriting shift meaning; ambiguity lingers in "patience to begin where avoided ending."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (puddles as altars, runes as cicadas); rhythmic control modulates from hovering tension to patient close, prose as character reflecting defier's loops. Stable single-POV first-person, no leakage; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at erasure payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers image/action/insight sans loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm passes read-aloud, syntax breathes with glides/lowers. Figurative coherence (ferns under starlight, throat snag) pattern-taught without muddle in peak arch beat. No artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural gen + fractured timelines transforms gravity-defiance trope into ground-acceptance arc; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via instant-suspension without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from tablet seed to erasure; no derivatives, bold perceptual angle on self-labyrinth.</comment>
