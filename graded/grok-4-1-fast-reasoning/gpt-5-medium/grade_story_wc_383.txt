<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic's doubt drives third-way method, with contradictory impulses ("faithless science nor surrendering prayer") acting in negotiation; final archiving choice earned by embodied conflict, as "weight of years settle on my tongue" forecloses refusal with felt cost of carrying winter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as resonance density builds to RR closure ("memory bled like ink into my keeping"); cost legible in "precise cold that did not sting," reconfiguring isolation into independence without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fountain and hedges constrain choices (shell placed against fountain triggers "shiver," water "speaks first"); final "fountain sighed in relief" charges closure image, with sensory details (moths' "ghostly resolve," "sea syllables") POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate sealed memory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via resonance transfer narrowing options; agency in "build a small bridge between our throats" forces trade-off, with cost ("winter in my chest") unmistakable in dispersal beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of useful sorrow emerges organically from transfer events; final "lantern unafraid of wind" offers resonant non-literal answer to isolation/independence question, reweighting shell and garden motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (weather/echo metaphors like "pressure, like weather pushing against a door") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from anticipatory to post-transfer clarity, with stable single-POV distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but figurative layering in peak transfer ("bled like ink," "dispersed into foam") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops, clear cause/effect in resonance beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell-memory resonance and chemical "structures" transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, with "winter... instructions for thaw" feeling inevitable from priors.</comment>
