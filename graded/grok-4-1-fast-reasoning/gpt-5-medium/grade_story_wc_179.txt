<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's scheming pacifism and Rell's embodied prickles unwinding show contradictory impulses acting in scene; final release earned via cellular memory factory walk. Rell's flinching fingers and kneeling return of years reveal character under sanctuary pressure with visible cost. No therapy-speak or stock epiphanies; traits constrain choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hush to cellular memory factory, pattern break in "silence forming music" yields Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "ribs vibrate with a pattern that forgives" and box as compass. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary; one tightening via neck touch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Music box and soundless sanctuary as micro-setting constrain choices (tilt reveals teeth, hush trembles defenses) and charge final image (box pressed into hands). Sensory hush, ripples, gusts selective via POV mercy lens. Spatial choreography clear in center guiding and corridor opening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release resentment) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via memory trigger narrowing to forgiveness vibration. Agency in guiding/touching yields trade-off cost: prickles unwind, unspent years returned. Escalation coherent under lens, charges "machine rows...carry breath instead of blame."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence arithmetic emerges via box pin, mother breath, resentment salting; ending reweights with "reality will continue to shift only as much as he does" sans moral. Subtext in unopened letters, clean factory implies complexity without binaries. Final window smile answers central release question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature: scheming observations like "trip him into his own kindness." Poetic rhythm modulates intensity, diction biased to mercy cellular lens. Slate writing "Keep it" natural, subtextual; no head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors consistent/voice-led (walls lengthen into halls), no loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies for ear (short punchy kneels, flowing ripples); minor figurative density in peak memory beat but pays off without muddle. Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary/music box/ cellular memory synthesize fresh lyric premise on resentment release; risk-taking in shifting reality heightens stakes coherently. Transformation test passes: irreplaceable particulars like crooked pin avoid tropes. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
