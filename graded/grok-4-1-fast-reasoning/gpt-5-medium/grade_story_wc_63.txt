<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between past precision ("tightened every screw as if grief were slop") and present listening act simultaneously in the pause's micro-choices; final offering of rake handle to fisherman earned by causal buildup of regret visions, with relational cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds reverie to pause tightening, closure as Charged Poise RR in pendulum release and fisherman carving, cost legible in "never finished" absolution and wider arc image reconfiguring precision into shared rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge and pendulum bob constrain choices (rake handle sourced there, bob eased to pause) and charge final image ("sea has spat up mirror shards," bob arcs wider); sensory selection (black glass breathes, salt/iron taste) POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shared balance) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density in pause visions forcing stance crystallization; agency in coaxing arbor/whispering names forecloses isolated precision with relational cost, legible in fisherman truce.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of woven balance vs. knifed line emerges organically from particulars; final image of carving child's name reweights premise without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer with ambiguity in "never finished."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (time as pulse/breath, sea heaving through timbers) modulates rhythmically with pressure; stable first-person POV biases details character-specifically, elision of exact mechanics taught early and legible at release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; figurative density in pause ("plank of silence... hot wire") borders overwriting but coherent and pattern-taught, minor purposeful repetition of "incremental absolution" without loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwinding as ethical listening via rake inscriptions transforms precision trope; risk in lyric pause reverie heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in ridge answering tower without rule retreat.</comment>
