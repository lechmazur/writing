<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in tastes ("iron and sea") and tremors, with nostalgia as flaw complicating duty; final endurance earned via micro-choices like embouchure shifts. Contradictory impulses (ache vs. oath) act in scene without tidy resolution. Minor abstraction in "hierarchy of values" phrasing slightly distances peak emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds as letters pearl and lines descend, tightening via sax disruptions; Charged Poise closure in "absence I have made... held open and harmless" with oath cost legible in final line. Orientation anchored early ("radiant grotto... prism atrium"). No lens ambiguity; constraint (fog holding notes) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium's facets constrain placement and scatter light into "narrow, trembling ribbons," charging prophecy formation and final absence image. Sensory hierarchy (visual condensation, auditory steam retreat, tactile breath) filters through saxophonist's priorities. Micro-setting (glass panes, cold points) evolves causally, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via forming lines met by register shifts and whispers, narrowing to last figure's lullaby. Agency in feathering breath forecloses completion with felt oath cost. One decisive deepening (second line naming city) forces tactical adaptation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of music-secrecy vs. devouring future emerges organically from vested hush actions, reweighted in final "ring... held open" without moralizing. Nostalgia motif shifts from ash-rain memory to oath-bearing closure. Resonant ambiguity in smiling listeners lingers via implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature in fog-notes-blur fusion; rhythmic modulation peaks in "tones climb... retreat into corners." Diction controlled, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping; inference matches saxophonist's knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tones climb the glass like steam" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Purposeful metaphors cohere in mist-music pattern without muddle. Minor figurative density in prophecy beats borders overwriting but pays off in hush image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sax as amulet against prophecy fuses music ritual with fog-texture originality; transforms nostalgia trope into eerie compulsion driving closure. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious "negative space" hush inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
