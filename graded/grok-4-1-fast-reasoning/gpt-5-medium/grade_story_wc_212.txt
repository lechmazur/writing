<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in "furiously tranquil, steady in their storm" hands cupping vortex; contradictory impulses of keeping without hoarding act simultaneously, culminating in earned planting choice with visible endurance cost. Grandmother's spectral nod reinforces inherited gestures as micro-choices. Final keeper commitment forecloses ownership path, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from egg crack to visions and planting as RR/Charged Poise, reconfiguring inheritance with conceptual cost of non-clutching in "I will be keeper as long as the pattern holds." Orientation anchored first line; visionary shards taught early via "step into the seasons." Cost legible in loam planting image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound atrium with "windows veined with ice that maps the sky" constrains actions (breath fogs glass, cold fills with rain scent); oak cap as micro-setting charges final image, steadying vortex and planted for thaw. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (seed scents over city glass). 9+ test met via constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wise Return stewardship) signaled early, textural escalation via unfurling density, pollen vision, entropy murmur tightening to planting renunciation; agency in singing layouts narrows hoarding option with felt endurance cost. Subtle but coherent under lens; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vortex inheritance via pattern/entropy emerges organically from particulars (seeds aligning, fern awakening); final image reweights hoarding vs. humming with non-literal resonance, no moralizing. Grandmother's "You kept it without keeping it" implies without stating. 9+ test: resonant answer recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing ("scent of rain that has not fallen"); stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose syntax mirrors serene wildness. Grandmother's brief speech natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; 9+ rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("The creature inside is no bird but a spiral of seedlings"); rhythmic variety, no loops/artifacts, figures coherent/patterned (spirals, braids pay off). Minor overwriting density in peak unfurling but taught/legible, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vortex seedlings/entropy inheritance fresh synthesis of eco-heirloom trope, transformed via city-glass orchard and non-causal seasons; risk-taking in lyric shards heightens stakes organically. Final rootlet arithmetic inevitable in hindsight; bold without gimmick.</comment>
