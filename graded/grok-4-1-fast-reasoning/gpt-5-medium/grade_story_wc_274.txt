<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the hesitation ritual ("I made a ritual from hesitation") and culminate in the earned release choice with personal cost to trade and future; interiority is concrete and particular through infrastructural metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure at "I did not know if I had preserved it or set it free"; cost legible in "melting the disciplined ice of my trade"; orientation anchored by ~50 words without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via duct and networks, charging final image ("frost bloomed across the glass like a curtain call"); sensory details (pipes hissing, snow drumming) selectively mirror internal states through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release vs. preservation risk) signaled early tightens via midnight duct action under Accumulative lens; agency in subtle release forecloses safe path with felt cost ("perhaps my future").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of maintenance as love emerges organically from letter's "braid of tenderness and infrastructure"; final bench image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting silence with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses archival and erotic infrastructure ("desire mapped in cables"); rhythmic control modulates from quiet density to resonant close without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern taught early (snow/frost/silence) propels without loops; rhythm varies read-aloud, climax image ("shelves knew already") clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryogenic archive, infrastructural romance, and viral whisper revolution; risk-taking in lyric release heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
