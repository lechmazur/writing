<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of analytical intuition as curse/compass drive pattern-following choices, earning final shield-carrying renunciation; volcanic tenderness embodies emotion without labels. Interiority concrete in noticing "patterns breathing behind dust." Flaw complicates without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artistic clues density-build to CR closure where seeds' ink reconfigures arson as primer with felt tenderness cost. Orientation anchored in opening lines. Stitching-to-planting tightening narrows to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring archive details (mosaic scales, feather-choked stairs, oculus seams) constrain trail-following choices and charge final sprouting image. Sensory filter via intuition sharpens urgency. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of promise-rescue tightens accumulatively via deepening pattern density to seed-planting agency with hammering-heart cost. One reversal at soot-lift forecloses erasure path. Minor abstractness in promise scale slightly mutes visceral bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of destructive preservation emerges organically from arson-primer reweighting; final living sentence answers vow-kept question resonantly without statement. Volcanic tenderness motif shifts from steam to undone without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("analytically intuitive" pattern-noticing) stable in first-person; rhythm modulates from intuitive tug to hammering crescendo. Compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; figurative density (knifed sunlight, curling ink) coherent and pattern-paid in revelation without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; ear-test rhythm peaks cleanly at seeds opening "like small eyes."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson-preservation in lost archive art-trail transforms trope via intuition-cost; seed-punctuation risk heightens stakes to vow-image without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from fragment-to-spool vector.</comment>
