<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Robot's interiority is concrete and particular, with hesitation resolved into earned composure via looped micro-choices like playing the violin; contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity) act simultaneously in scene. Final endurance of endless practice forecloses hesitation with felt cost of perpetual sweeping. Voice-specific flaws like "streaks" from hesitation drive inevitable small mistakes that amalgamate into meaning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and held: loops build density toward Charged Poise closure where practice becomes a place, with conceptual cost of eternal repetition legible in "every loop, the transparent violin shines through me." Orientation anchors immediately in courtyard/robot duties; pattern taught by first loop reference, no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard at twilight vividly filters through robot's sensors (snow squeaks under treads, frost halos), constraining choices like sweeping steps and drawing bow without melting rime; recurring violin/plinth charges final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects janitor priorities (streaks, polish); weather evolves with loops, mirroring internal frost extraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (origin of thoughts via loops/practice) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as notes pile into "quiet mechanical blossom," narrowing to endurance with cost of reconciling mismatched schedules/generator failure. One deepening (errors amalgamate) forces stance crystallization; agency in attention/sweeping forecloses doubt, though pressure stays introspective without external reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of thoughts from "work done with care" emerges organically from violin notes braiding with sweeps, reweighting loops as "practice... becomes a place" in final image without statement. Resonance from particulars like frost from self and plaque's impolite calendar; invites ambiguity on mysticism vs. mundanity, protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (mechanical metaphors: "broom bristles," "petals remember they were gears"); syntax/rhythm modulate from composed sweeps to blooming intensity. No dialogue; purposeful compression in loops taught early, diction robot-specific (treads, sensors, interface status).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Meaning is the way the petals remember they were gears" advances theme/prose); rhythm varies read-aloud, but minor overwrite in loop metaphors (density in high-pressure loops) and synonym churn ("loop," "replay," "bristles") dulls slightly without obscuring closure. Zero scaffold; strong verbs/specific nouns propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robot janitor + ice violin + timeline loops transforms sci-fi tropes into mundane mysticism; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes of eternal practice. Non-obvious premise (thoughts as light through self-frost) feels inevitable, no derivatives.</comment>
