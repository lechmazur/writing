<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied surreal perception and micro-choices like tasting the shard; contradictory grief impulses act in dialogue ("exits always end as mouths"); final acceptance earned by prior visions of fire/child self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via shard presses and geometry folds to CR closure; "halo fragment brightens, no longer shard but ring" reconfigures time/grief premise with legible cost of fading present; orientation anchored early in garden entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (humming shard, braiding bridges, lichen dress) constrain choices like bridge descents; recurring garden elements charge final blooming image; POV filter as designer sharpens geometric notice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture amid grief trap) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through visions narrowing to acceptance; agency in shard uses forecloses past fixation with cost "present is a continual photograph fading"; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of labyrinthine grief/time emerges organically from looped paths/photos to resonant CR; final "quaking reverie that holds still" reweights premise without moralizing; subtext in woman's dialogues layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with perceptual signature in organic/geometric diction; stable first-person filters surreal events; sparse dialogue carries subtext ("You stitched grief into paths") and advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion with purposeful metaphor patterns (ribs/knots/curves); minor figurative density in peak visions slightly risks overload but remains coherent/legible; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Bold surreal synthesis of hyperbolic gardens, retrocognitive shards, and grief mazes feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes; "bridges grow where footprints wish" transforms tropes organically.</comment>
