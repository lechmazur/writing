<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via drawer pull's embodied warmth/pulse tying to survival motivation; micro-choices like showing it to the flinching boy reveal values under pressure. Relationships crucible exchanges, forcing Raglen's grunt and Della's grain gift. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; endurance earned but poised.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from halts to snag to exchanges, closure as Charged Poise in mist thinning and drawer cooling with conceptual cost of held past. Orientation anchored early (parapet, mist, moon). One tightening at name snag narrows options; final image reconfigures before/after legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring drawer pull and mist constrain choices (slick teeth flinch, narrow parapet) and charge final image (metal cools as mist thins). Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency: footsteps as sentences, wind pressing mist. Weather evolves causally, mirroring exhale of armor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peaceful untethering) signaled early, tightens at snag where tempers climb, forcing defusal trade-off. Agency in speeches forecloses argument path with felt cost (shoulders drop). Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes emerges organically via drawer pull's tarnish holding dual stories, resonant in final cooling image reweighting past without moral. Subtext in silences and nods; ambiguity lingers in clipped coin moon. No statements; earned from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in furrowed hush phrasing and biased noticing (mist as fingers, steps as sentences). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Listen," "This is not where we argue"), advances goals. Rhythmic control modulates tension; stable first-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short exhales amid lyricism). Figurative coherent/patterned (mist hush motif) without muddle in snag beat. Minor metaphor density in opening pressures propulsion slightly; no loops, scaffold clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh poetic negotiator transforms prisoner trope via drawer pull's lived specificity and neutral "harvest" lens. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscurity. Inevitable synthesis of wisdom/recycling in cooling metal; no templates.</comment>
