<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character-specific methods (loop pedal, rhetoric) compel Mara's release with earned renunciation of the "contract," revealing flaws like grief's compromise; husband's skepticism adds secondary pressure without clutter. Interiority concrete via embodied actions (Mara's lips move, voice flexes). Minor slip: limited contradictory impulses shown beyond final flex, but closure choice feels motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with layered loops, rhetoric, and palette building to Charged Poise closure ("it slipped toward the palette... became a lake with no exit"); orientation anchored early (chapel, arrival, Mara). One tightening via palette turn narrows options decisively. Cost legible in "nearly complete... evaporated like breath on glass."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chapel as dimensional anchor and ultramarine palette constrain choices (palette "listens," traps whisper), charging final image; sensory hierarchy (muffled clarity, frost-like absence) reflects priest's perceptual bias. Atmosphere tensions surreal possession with tactile tools. Micro-setting (palette) evolves, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent possession completion, avert tilt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via loop density and rhetoric ("voice shivered"); agency in priest's layered inquiries forces whisper's exposure with visible cost (Mara "stepping into a photograph"). Escalation driven by on-page choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief as binding contract emerges organically from parable ("key hidden... what did you turn into jewelry") and rhetoric unthreading it; final image reconfigures "borrowed voices crave a color" without moralizing. Subtext in silences and palette reflection invites ambiguity on possession's nature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (priest notices "shield crack," "tiny bruise") with rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable close third-person focalization on his inquiry. Rhetorical speech distinct, goal-driven ("Mara, Mara, Mara"). Purposeful compression legible in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("words stopped sliding and began to stand upright"); figurative density pattern-taught early, coherent in peak (palette "mouth waiting... lake with no exit"). Minor metaphor pile-up dulls one beat ("quiet torn open by invisible fingers"), but no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism via loop pedal/rhetoric/palette synthesis, inevitable in hindsight ("rhetoric had unthreaded the knot"); bold surrealism (dimensional anchor, color traps voice) heightens stakes organically, fresh beyond tropes.</comment>
