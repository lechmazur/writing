<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between owning transition and keeping company act in the planting beat and realization ("my task was not to own transition, but to keep company"), earned by prior rituals with visible cost in ambitions quieting but persisting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from voice on rails to seed splitting; RR closure in "The arbor releases a soft chime" reconfigures ambitions with felt cost of endurance, constraint of drifting rails shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Barky pulses, filings swimming into script, and tuned soil constrain node adjustments and planting; final helix drinking field charges closure image, filtering through translator's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reestablishing guidance tightens via hum's return and seed rooting, agency in analogical pressures narrowing options; cost legible in "haunted ambitions quiet, not erased," charging final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared transitions emerges organically via orchard grammar and breath bridges; final seed gleam offers resonant answer to physics of transition, reweighting ambitions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct analogical perceptual signature ("rail to a reed") and rhythmic control modulate with intensity; stable first-person, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at seed's helix payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and integrated images; no loops or muddle, metaphors consistent ("trunks settle like sentences"), ear-test rhythm peaks in "pale helix that drinks the tuned field."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform rituals in magnetic orchard transforms tropes of loss into resonant physics; risk-taking in analogical world logic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at chime's intimacy.</comment>
