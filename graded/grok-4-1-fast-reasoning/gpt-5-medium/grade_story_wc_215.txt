<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Astonished recluse's interiority shines in concrete embodiment like "meaning tasted metallic" and past broker tying to covenant guilt, compelling the climactic full opening of the box; contradictory endurance of loss vs. arrogance of survival earns final sigil choice with felt pain-cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like refused clause complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ghosts/box rituals builds to queen's charred frame gesture as tightening, yielding CR closure in blue stripe image reweighting premise of endless sorrow to "careful archives" with endurance cost legible in "tolerable stings" and waited footsteps. Orientation anchored early; no breaks, pattern taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Apiary micro-setting constrains via noon light paths queuing ghosts and comb lectern holding frame, charging final blue stripe; sensory bias (burnt sugar scent, ash swirls) filters through recluse's perceptive hush. Recurrent box/object evolves, mirroring internal archive without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unspoken covenant) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via queen's heat gesture forcing full lid-open agency/renunciation with sting-pain cost altering to kiln role; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in sigil-marked panel, foreclosing evaporation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mute archive vs. evaporating loss emerges organically from shards/ghost hushes, reweighted non-literally in "language returned with pollen" image answering initial fear; ambiguity lingers in blue road without moralizing, counter-readings plausible in guilt-led preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases to "contextual clues" like shadow angles, with rhythmic diction modulating from whispered willows to colors flooding; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image, no head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., "colors spilled... ghosts queued"), no loops/artifacts dulling closure; minor figurative density in peak (charred combs to constellations) stays coherent/patterned without muddle, though slight overuse nudges from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc ghosts/bees into silence-archive premise transforms tropes via glass-box kiln and hexagon sigil; risky lyric risk-taking heightens stakes in covenant heat, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
