<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to reveal hidden effort compels micro-choices like the tea demonstration and whistlings that convert the skeptical councilor, earning a communal shift; interiority particular via net/foam patterns, though sage archetype limits contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from solitary mending to crowd's naming of unsung laborers, landing CR closure in child's whisk inheritance reweighting gratitude's passage with dawn's felt time-cost; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Parapet runoff and fireflies constrain the demo and charge final image, with POV-filtered details like "water threads... murmuring like apprentices" mirroring hidden effort; sensory hierarchy selective to mender's pattern-sight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of demonstrating invisible effort vs. spectacle tightens accumulatively through councilor's frown-to-sash wipe and crowd's naming, forcing narrator's endurance with visible cost in no-clapping norm and encroaching dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges via particulars like fisher's net and froth roads, reweighted non-literally in councilor's concession and whisk handoff without moral state; ambiguity lingers in "patterns; tomorrow, for hands."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-mapping syntax ("each knot remembers a hand") modulates rhythmically with pressure, dialogue sparse/subtextual ("You brought us to watch puddles"); stable first-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (storms/foam/lanterns) propels without loops; varied rhythm reads aloud as humming parapet, clarity intact even in peak councilor conversion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending lyricism transforms sage trope via tea-whisk demo into communal mending, risking poetic density that heightens stakes through irreplaceable image of fireflies combing hair.</comment>
