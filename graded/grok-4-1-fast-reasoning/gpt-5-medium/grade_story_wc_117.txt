<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ada's grief embodied via locket and whisper shows particularity and earned change through sharing and locket placement; narrator's adaptive micro-choices reveal values under group pressure. Minor therapy-speak in "wondering is a form of love" whispers unearned epiphany, but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from kalimba scales to totality's hush, landing Charged Poise RR in Ada's traced curl and steadied breath with felt cost of enduring grief. Orientation anchored early in arrival/courtyard; one tightening via locket on guitar hums closure without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sage, stone, eclipse silvering shadows, and tree roots constrain moves (glasses ceremony, settle beneath) and charge final hillside chord image. Sensory hierarchy via therapist's rhythm-attuned notice feels lived; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture wonder amid grief) signaled early, tightens via Ada's story-to-locket progression under Accum lens, narrowing to shared totality with agency in guitar placement. Cost legible in Ada's persistent "question mark" grief, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically via music-grief-eclipse weave, culminating in lullaby request that reconfigures loss without stating moral. Particulars like wheat-colored curl shifting to hummed memory avoid platitudes; resonant ambiguity in "keep it alive."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (rhythm/breath attunement) stable in single POV; syntax modulates from patient scales to totality compression. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in Ada's throat-clear; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "moon bit into the sun like a patient moth" purposeful, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies read-aloud from draped notes to incremental sun return. Peak totality beat clean of overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Locket-on-guitar hum during eclipse synthesizes grief/music/wonder freshly; transforms eclipse trope via adaptive therapy into charged poise. Risk in lyric compression pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
