<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in scar-specific memories like the kiln burn revealed through rune-drawing micro-choices, earning the final drink as transformative endurance; contradictory shame vs. forgiveness impulses act on-page without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as rune density and breath constraint build to CR closure in the drinking beat ("runes float like petals that happen to be alphabets"), with legible breath-cost reweighting scars-to-stories stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Platform, ink, and held breath as micro-settings constrain rite choices and charge final image; sensory steam/quill facets filter through POV superstitions, vivid yet selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to transform scars tightens via breath-burning escalation and rune-deepening under accumulative lens, forcing endurance agency with chest-burn cost legible before drink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-stories emerges organically from superstition-traced runes; final "warmth slowly" reconfigures pain's premise without moralizing, resonant via petal-alphabet image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature in tea/superstition metaphors modulates rhythmically under breath-stress; diction/prose reflect strained scholar's mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (ink facets as fear-shards); minor repetition of "superstitions" taught as pattern, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rune-tea ritual on storm-tethered platform synthesizes fresh alchemy of scars/memory/manners; risk in lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, transforming superstition tropes boldly.</comment>
