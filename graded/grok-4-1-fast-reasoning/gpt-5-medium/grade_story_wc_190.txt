<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to craft comforting silence earned through past singer's leap and micro-choices like dimming lights; passenger's logical speech vs. turbulent hands shows contradiction acting in scene. Final unclenching earned by prior sharing of grief equation and first quiet memory. Minor slip: passenger arc slightly swift despite textural build.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush motifs and vial changes build to Charged Poise closure where passenger's shoulders loosen and vial clears as "new angle for its light," reweighting stake with cost of forgoing computation for air's hold. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. Cost legible in final image of non-speaking as window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace, storm glass vial, and velvet baffles constrain choices (monitoring, routing for hush) and charge final image (facets' geometry on face, terrace's new light angle). Sensory hush, iron smell, pearly crystals selective and POV-biased toward silence metrics. Environment mirrors internal states via causal vial shifts without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catalyzing comfort in silence for grief-logician) signaled early, textural escalation via deepening disclosures (equation → stairwell memory) narrows to unclenching under hush pressure. Agency in narrator's practices forces stance shift; cost felt in renouncing hand/computation for air's hold. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as shaped comfort emerges from vial crystals, baffles, and memories; final image reconfigures "air can hold her without hands" as resonant answer to grief's unholding equation, reweighting absences without moral state. Subtext in silences and implications avoids tidy binaries. Particulars like felt-wrapped scales drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (hush temperatures, soundfall ribbons) biased to silence guild; stable POV with clean distance modulating to intimacy in passenger queries. Dialogue subtextual ("only catalyze"), natural, goal-pursuing; syntax/rhythm poetic yet legible, reflecting gondola drift. No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with drift cadence, high density in vial/hush images advances texture; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite figurative prevalence—coherent hush pattern taught/paid off without obscuring closure. Minor density strain in peak descriptive runs, but propulsion clear. Opening/final lines recharge echo motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-guild gondola on prism terrace transforms transit tropes into comfort catalysis; risk-taking in lyric hush metrics heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration (cradle cable, measured lullaby) inevitable from vial/echo particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
