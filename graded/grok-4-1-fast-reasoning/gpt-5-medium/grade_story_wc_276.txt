<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's cool-headedness embodied in "patience in my mouth" and micro-choices like gripping the spike and voicing silence reveal contradictory calm under surreal pressure; final release of the map earns a meaningful renunciation with felt cost in foreclosing possession. Internal conflict layers in tasting currents amid the garden's chaos. No stock phrasing; traits particular and flawed with steady struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from casting silence to spike's mapping and release; on-page Conceptual Repricing in "let the map spill back into the tide" reconfigures coastline stakes with conceptual cost of endless opening. Orientation anchored early at jetty; single scene coherent without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sound wave garden and rail spike as micro-settings constrain choices, e.g., spike "transliterates emotions" to read currents and trace coastline, charging final spill image. Sensory hierarchy (sound as brine, visual star footprints) filters through fisher's priorities; details tactile and purposeful without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore coast via goddess echo tightens texturally through constellation encounters and spike-planting, narrowing to release with agency in "I lifted the spike"; cost legible in foreclosed hoarding as garden shudders. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens with deepening pattern break.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as creative force emerges organically from particulars like "voicing silence" aligning with "empty bar between notes," answered non-literally in map's spill reweighting possession vs. release. Subtext in star judgments and goddess breath avoids morals; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses sound/music with sea ("braided music, ripples of bass"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, compressing at peak "The garden shuddered." Single POV stable, voice as fisher's mind with biased noticing; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern taught early (sound-as-sea) propels without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies, e.g., short peaks in "Sound became brine, brine became wind." No overwriting coherence loss—metaphors consistent in surreal logic, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic garden, sleepwalking stars, silence-fishing transforms tropes into inevitable logic; risk in surreal rules heightens stakes, culminating in spike's release as bold, non-obvious reconfiguration without retreat.</comment>
