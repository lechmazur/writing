<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preservation and building act in the pond communion and boy dialogue; final choice to integrate ferry scars earned by prior stake with visible cost in reframed atrium vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ripple patterns and visions build density to CR closure; "we were its light first" reconfigures development premise with conceptual cost of lost ordinary, on-page legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pond as micro-setting constrains communion choice and charges final pocketed-stone image; harbor details (salt, gulls, bait shack) filtered through glazier bias, evolve with reflections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate mundane vs. spectacle/development) signaled early, deepens via pond reading and boy exchange narrowing to integrated build; cost felt in "scars as tributaries," agency in planned argument.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final atrium image offers resonant answer to mundane-vs-spectacle question, reweighting prior ripples and ferry without moral; emerges organically from glazier choices and conflicts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light/refraction diction and ripple rhythm; stable first-person with boy dialogue subtext advancing stake; modulates intensity purposefully under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., ring stanzas), no loops; figurative coherence in light/prism vehicles serves voice without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pond-ripple method as fresh glazier ingenuity transforms mundane divination trope; bold lyric synthesis of work/wonder feels inevitable, risks heighten closure resonance.</comment>
