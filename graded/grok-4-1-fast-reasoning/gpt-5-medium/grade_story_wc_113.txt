<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (cold nibbling shins, lantern in teeth) and micro-choices under pressure (careful page turns, stepping on glints) reveal a fearful yet curious musician; final baton raise earns change via prior obedience. Ethereal passivity slightly mutes contradictory impulses in pivotal crossing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from program stains to projected score and baton conduct; orientation anchors early (pit musician in flooded house). Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with legible cost in "disrupt the loop of drowning" and settling water.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Flooded setting constrains choices (knee-deep water, reflection-stepping) and charges final image (lanterns brightening in-between spaces into bridges). Sensory details (drips, creaks, perfume) filter through musician's perceptual bias, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel code without drowning) signaled early, escalates texturally via pattern-deepening (stains to score to baton); one tightening at reflection-crossing forecloses disobedience with felt fear/cold cost. Agency in obedience narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence/breathing in-between emerges organically from rests-to-breaths shift, reweighting drowning loop without moralizing; final coda image ("program's stains rearrange into a coda shaped like dawn") offers resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (musical metaphors like "tremulous as air above a bow"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative language dense but pattern-taught in lyric mode, coherent without muddle. Minor overwriting risks in descriptive runs ("blooms of ink that look like moth wings") but propels textural accumulation without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ghost trope via water-damaged program-as-score and conducting silence; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at baton climax.</comment>
