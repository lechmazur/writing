<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "pace the aisles in reverse, because my body walks backwards when nervous, rehearsing retreat to defend presence," earning the trial stance with embodied trembling cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shadow-spill and tea-reading density tightens to Charged Poise closure; council stay reconfigures exile options with felt reversal cost in final shelving image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Library stacks and floorboards constrain nervous pacing, charging trial choreography; shadow corridor as micro-setting evolves to underline salvaged margins, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove reversible exile escalates via tea geometry deepening, forcing council stance crystallization; archivist agency in spilling shadow narrows options with on-page heat-in-chest price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Reversible exile theme emerges organically from shadow corridor pivoting sorrow, reweighting council's duty in reflection without statement; final swing hush resonates as non-literal answer to keeping's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust instructs light to fold") biases noticing toward shards and ellipses; minimal dialogue natural with child subtext ("Your stubborn kindness"), advancing under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but pervasive figurative layering ("bruise remembering light") borders overload in reflective beats without harming trial clarity or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Shard-mirror archivist and tea geometry synthesize fresh memory-trial frame; bold lyric risk in reverse pacing heightens stakes, transforming exile into indispensable hinge without gimmick.</comment>
