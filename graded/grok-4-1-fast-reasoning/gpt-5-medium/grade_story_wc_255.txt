<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivo's colorblindness drives concrete micro-choices like reading smoke by flavor and trading his brush, earning his realization that beauty is rhythm; flaws complicate without hedging. Mira applies pressure via plant replies, forcing adaptation. Final stay-choice forecloses wandering with felt cost in traded tools.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of plant trades and reed play builds to CR closure where Ivo reconfigures imperfection as song, with cost in brush/smoke forfeiture legible at "He offers his best brush... then adds a jar of smoke." One tightening via reed awakening suffices; orientation anchored early in courtyard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Courtyard, furnaces, phoenix slag constrain choices (plants on sill, glass cooling) and charge final image of "courtyard holds enough awakenings." Sensory filter via Ivo's temperature/flavor perception; recurring glass bubbles mirror internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in imperfection) signaled early, tightens via reed play that awakens "edges of things breathe," narrowing to acceptance with trade-off cost in lost brush/jar. Pressure coheres accumulatively; agency in whisper/play/plant signals stay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect beauty emerges via trades/images, answered non-literally in "world chooses its own edges" realization reweighting color as "one oath among many, and breakable." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like reed chord tasting "rain on nailheads."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (light as gravel, smoke by flavor) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from quiet study to "soft chord slides out." Compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., short punchy reed play sentences amid lyric flow); no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (glass breathing, phoenix rising). Propulsion peaks at "a soft chord slides out, tasting of rain," without overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind painter, plant semiotics, reed awakening sense in glassworld; transforms market trope via bartered imperfections. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at laughter without proof.</comment>
