<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Heiress's wager via logic reveals contradictory impulses toward truth and mercy; final board call earned by prior observation and test, with embodied pen-nib reflection showing micro-choice cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from wager to lens closure and stalled printers delivers DC closure with legible cost in stalled editions; single scene holds orientation from opening line, lens consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echoes and lens constrain wager/test choices and charge final pen-nib image; sensory details (ink-cedar smell, tame rain echoes) filter through heiress's sky-proofreading bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to expose device tightens via proof-by-contradiction test, forcing agency in shutter seal and board call; cost unmistakable in city-wide stall and policy shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gravity/orbit motifs emerge from device test to reweight info-manipulation premise; final pen-nib "spike" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sky-ink metaphors modulates with pressure; dialogue subtextual (caretaker's "dramatist" evasion), voices idiomatic and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative texture purposeful in lyric mode with varied rhythm; minor density strain in revelation beat ("orbits of regret") avoids muddle but borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory as news-tide manipulator synthesizes fresh angle on media power; risk in poetic voice heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
