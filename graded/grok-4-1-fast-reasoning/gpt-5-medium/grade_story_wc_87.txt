<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine when narrator curves along shore "the way a hand traces a bruise" yet risks helping boy, earning change via prior regret's cost; interiority concrete and particular, no stock epiphanies; relationship with boy forces micro-choice revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure—"heart and actions share a shoreline"—with legible cost in "carrying sorrow... open and used"; orientation anchored early at launch; no shards, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Utility poles as recurring object constrain choices ("skipping false cuts") and charge final image ("humming grid"); coastal details vivid/selective (eelgrass, saplings bent seaward), mirror internal bruise-tracing; body/kayak tactile, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align heart/action vs. regrets) signaled early, tightens via agency when "nosed the kayak toward the boy" foreclosing retreat; cost felt in chest-burn/remembered map; lens escalation via density to crystallized poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regrets' backlash vs. countercurrent emerges organically via poles/compass reprise shifting from jittery reflection to "stubborn as tide"; resonant non-literal close reweights without moralizing; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in navigational metaphors ("planks easing from a dock"); first-person stable, no leakage; dialogue sparse/natural ("broken but working"), subtext-laden; rhythm modulates from melancholic to steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punches amid lyric flow), high density propels; minor overwriting in metaphors ("gulls sang like somebody practicing forgiveness off-key") risks coherence in reflective beats but spares closure; no loops/artifacts dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation regrets via utility poles as "stitched scars"—transforms redemption trope through specific coastal ingenuity; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight in final shoreline map.</comment>
