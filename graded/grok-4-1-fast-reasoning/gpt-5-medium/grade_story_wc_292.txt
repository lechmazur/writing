<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to honor ancestor drives all choices, culminating in nail insertion that earns returns with director confrontation as cost; interiority embodied through vest-pocket nail and panel questioning. Nervously confident trait shows in "rickety priest" hesitation before decisive act. Minor slip: director feels stock ("dry as paperwork") without deeper pressure on protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journals' stanzas lead to panel (setup), nail insertion causes "machine wetly shiver" and mists' reversal (DC with director's control as cost). Orientation anchored immediately ("experimental weather station"). Single scene, no shards; closure reconfiguration legible in "footprints stitching back."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dripping anemometers and "boundary mists" constrain descent to panel and charge reversal image ("pearled with footprints"); sensory mold smells and humidity bias POV's map-questioning. Weather (squalls, jet stream) pressures exterior action. Recurrent mists evolve from cul-de-sac to "braided both directions."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix exile via ancestor honor vs. director control) signaled early, tightens via nail act forcing director arrival and returns; agency in insertion forecloses director's "misplacing the switch." Cost legible in his raving and march to deck. Causal escalation narrows to confrontation without reversal excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship vs. control emerges via nail/journals/mists particulars, reweighted in "mists now braided both directions" as non-literal answer to reversible promises. Subtext in Liza's whisper and director's lies avoids moralizing. Final image resonates with opening dread's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature in map/stanza metaphors ("maps are questions"); voice modulates from spongey dread to "dread spongey but no longer directionless." Dialogue subtextual ("misplaced the switch") advances goals. No head-hopping; diction fits librarian idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short climax sentences ("A low clunk answered"); density high but figurative overload in peak ("sheets a tongue... truer pronunciation") dulls propulsion slightly (-0.4). No loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent if dense. Clear causality in action sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-fog exile unlocked by ancestor nail transforms tropes; risk in poetic sci-fi voice heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Climax turn ("nail into maw") inevitable from stanzas. No derivative echoes; closure boldness elevates.</comment>
