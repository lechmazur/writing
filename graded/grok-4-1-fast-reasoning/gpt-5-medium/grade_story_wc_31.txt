<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular ("heartbeat settled into a tethered metronome"); contradictory impulses (ridiculous pledge on land, reasonable below) act in scene; final vow earned by prior micro-choices with binding cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dive to library glow to earned hum-color; CR closure in surfacing vow reconfigures premise with undeniable binding cost ("light the pier without tiring").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken ship/library constrains choices (kelp parts, ribs yawn, silt books brushed); recurring key tag and hull slats frame lanterns, charging final image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (light reflections as priority).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color of sound) signaled early, deepens via agency (mouth vow, press key tag) under Accumulative lens; cost legible in tethered heartbeat and foreclosed tiring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (patience trains ear, sound as colorable weather) emerges from particulars (glowing vows, silver hum); final image non-literally answers without moral, reweighting lanterns as notes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (lanterns as "careful planets," hum "tarnished... with rust"); rhythmic control modulates intensity; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied syntax, no loops); metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (light/sound palette culminates payoff); zero scaffold obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis (color of sound via luminous vows in silt library) feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens stakes, transforming tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
