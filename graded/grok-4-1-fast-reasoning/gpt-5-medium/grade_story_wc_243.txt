<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation to preserve moments drives all micro-choices with embodied haunted euphoria ("bright as salt behind my eyes"); woman's specifics (thermos, scar) reveal under pressure, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; reunion earns via prior process without safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from locket/tide to walk/photo context to footsteps/reunion; on-page Charged Poise closure as covenant regenerates via proximate causes ("ladder remade itself"), reconfiguring options with felt loss cost ("loss makes the world ring clearer"); orientation anchored immediately, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty's blooming thrift, warm boards, barnacles constrain walk/choices and charge final image ("jetty bloomed in its last light"); sensory hierarchy (tide hum, gull parenthesis) reflects archivist's perceptual bias, evolving causally with dusk; micro-setting (planks, rail rust) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate covenant via preserved moments) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through her story/walk to man's arrival forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in recalled storm ("rope cut at night") and foreclosed absence path; agency in archivist's process narrows options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of proximate causes regenerating covenants emerges organically from particulars (thermos/scar to reunion ladder); final image ("page warmed...sealed with salt") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting loss into clarity, with ambiguity (no touch yet) lingering; no moralizing, irony in archivist's indirect reunion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("walnut arcs," "tide hummed like a low string") modulates rhythm under rising euphoria; stable single POV, no head-hopping; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I do not repair, I remember"), advances via implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety ("swallows stitched dusk...gull let the wind hold it"); figurative pattern taught early pays off at closure without muddle; no loops/scaffold, propulsion aligns with scene (slow steep to buoyant ache); minor density saturation in mid-beats unpenalized as voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink archivist premise transforms memory/reunion trope via proximate causes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; turns (context shift, footsteps) inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
