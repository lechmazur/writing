<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through consistent traits like evasion-learned calm and contradictory impulses toward exits versus acceptance; motivation to probe circling paths earns final endurance with felt cost in lingering. Minor slip: limited on-page micro-choices dilute embodied conflict in pivotal rise/fall beats. Closing realization in tiger car feels character-bound and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to fall's cadence shift, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure where final image ("tire rut that entered and exited through the same gate") reweights premise with conceptual cost of inescapable circles. Orientation anchors early (twilight train); shards taught by ~25% via rise/fall pattern. No causality breaks; cost legible in shutdown morning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Circus train as micro-setting constrains choices (office in sleeper car, markers on rails) and charges closure (tiger car rut mirrors circling paths). Sensory details (wind, kettle steam, crackling bills) selective via POV bias toward faded memory. Final posters-as-scripture image evolves causally with shutdown.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe circling paths) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via rise's sprint to fall's deepening, narrowing to renunciation with visible cost (investors withdraw, coders leave). Agency in building/dissuading tests commitment; final lingering crystallizes stance under lens. Minor abstractness softens some prices mid-beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable circles emerges organically from particulars (maps, ribbons, ruts), reweighting premise in non-literal final image without moralizing. Subtext in signs/ribbons carries ambiguity (persuasive yet useless); protagonist arc inextricable from question. Resonance avoids platitudes via father's imagined understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing breaths, faded lions, small noises) biases toward dusky transience; rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure. Single POV stable, voice as character via polished syntax reflecting calm evasion. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "rise had been a staircase... fall an escalator"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("unclaimed thunderheads") during growth beats risks coherence, but pattern-taught lyricism avoids artifacts. Closure image crisp, no loops touching end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: robber's son startup in circus train transforms wanderlust tropes via lived circling logic, risking mosaic timeframe for inevitability. Final "hunted and hunter trade names" turn inevitable from prior particulars; bold voice commits without retreat.</comment>
