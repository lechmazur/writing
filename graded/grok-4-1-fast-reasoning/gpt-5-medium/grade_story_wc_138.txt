<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Immortal's boredom as consistent trait drives collecting echoes and intrigue with Lio, earning purpose as borrowed mortality; contradictory impulses in refusing endings yet seeking goodbye's aftermath act in scene via whispering to prisms and paying memories. Lio's unforgiving face softens via corridor, revealing character through micro-choice. Final pocket of fragment shows earned revision with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragment warming to corridor emergence, landing CR closure where "goodbye is...blueprint of the next room" reconfigures parting's premise with conceptual cost of mended bridges. Orientation anchored in first line; single scene coherent. Cost legible in "purpose is the closest thing to mortality an immortal can borrow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite and obsidian mirrors constrain via prisms obeying whispers and flowering spectra; recurring coils/prisms charge final contraction image. Sensory hierarchy (hushed thunder, spectrum knives) reflects immortal's dimensional awareness. Pivotal: storm's auroras braiding fragment narrows spatial tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (after-goodbye discovery) signaled early, tightens texturally via corridor's unsaid farewells mapping infrastructure, forcing endurance with memory payment cost. Agency in tuning coils and walking pretends bravery. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, cost unmistakable in softened forgiveness and edged boredom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye as infrastructure emerges via corridor's "promises...mapping exits," resonant CR reweighting without moral; final image of fragment preferring stories charges prior motifs. Subtext in Lio's laugh as thunder key embraces ambiguity. No tidy resolution, complexity in immortal's borrowed purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (geometry rumors, angles rebellion) biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, compression in corridor walk heightens. First-person stable, no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but subtextual: "might forgive me later" pursues goal via indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors coherent ("prisms flowered...polished knives") taught early, payoff in contraction. Minor overwrite in stacked figures during corridor but pattern pays off without muddle. No loops; rhythm varies, final line recharges aurora motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms tropes (immortal boredom, cursed object) into spatial goodbye cartographies; fresh synthesis of sci-fi geometry with emotional infrastructure feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes via mutiny strike. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
