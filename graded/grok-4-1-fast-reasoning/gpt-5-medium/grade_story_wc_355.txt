<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eclectic pacifist vividly embodied in non-prying tools and tuning method, with contradictory impulses (reluctant performer yet speaks to night) acting in scene; final inheritance earned via prior gentle causality, throat tightening as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from hush-recording to clasp-opening to diary-entry; resonant reconfiguration (RR) lands on-page with emotional cost in "My throat tightens, because I am not only collecting sound; I am inheriting a promise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop, copper bowl, mothwing mic constrain choices (gentle tuning over prying) and charge final image of steady pages amid shaking fireworks; sensory hierarchy (silence tastes, hums coils) reflects POV's empathic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentle clasp-opening/cataloging) signaled early, tightens via successful resonance turning abstract gap-recovery into concrete inheritance; textural deepening forecloses forceful path with legible emotional price in throat-tightening realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Empathy-via-silences theme emerges organically from particulars (hospital antiseptic oranges, kitchen dough); final entry-image reweights premise non-literally as narrator stitches "space for strangers" without conquest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in silence-metaphors ("tastes like rain withheld") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from coiled smoke-tones to blooming sky, stable first-person distance under textural pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated into action (tone "coils like smoke around the clasp"); no loops/artifacts, propulsion varies rhythmically to peak in "pages thin as moth lungs" without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-pacifist-touch transforms lock-opening trope; risk-taking in sonic-empathy premise inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via non-violent hinge-memory without gimmickry.</comment>
