<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Translator's motivation to graft meaning onto wounds drives concrete micro-choices like palming coral and decrypting cast; contradictory impulses (hush vs. bridging) act in scene via showing "Also Us" boat. Internal conflict embodied in "testing translations under breath." Final coral offering earned by prior causality with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cast readings and coral handling builds to Charged Poise closure at "room unclenches" and mother's reach, reconfiguring family divide with felt relational cost legible in "fog lower like a treaty." Orientation anchored early ("mist-clad atrium," "after anesthetic"). One tightening via script-stitching suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coral as micro-setting constrains choices (palm-held relic to "key"/punctuation) and charges final bedside image; mist-clad atrium and rain evolve causally, mirroring internal states via "vents breathe like distant surf" and "rain ticking like type."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging via shared anxieties) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through cast decryption to script-sharing under lens; agency in showing boats forces trade-off, cost legible in "knot slacken" and room's unclenching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of peace via grafted meanings emerges organically from cast boats and coral grooves; final "we brought ourselves" and ungloved hand reweight premise non-literally, embracing ache's bearability without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct oceanic perceptual signature ("reefs themselves are dictionaries") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in peak ("monitors speak pelagic syllables"), stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (oceanic motifs taught early), varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwrite in mixed vehicles like "war-bell dulls to gong of rain" docks slightly but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translation as reef/cartography transforms conflict trope; risk-taking in sustained lyric mode heightens stakes via coral's evolving charge without gimmickry.</comment>
