<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "I could have shouted, but... let people see themselves in the mirror first," earning the gentle exposure with visible cost in quiet resolution; interiority particular via silt/steel language without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream patterns accumulate to globe reveal (tightening), culminating in Charged Poise CR at "we watched the melted snow globe shine... then rest," with conceptual cost of gentle stasis legible in stuck crank and no cheers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glacier shrine portholes and ferry "ribs where cabins gape like pulled teeth" constrain listening/diving choices; silt "moves as if remembering" and "borrowed starlight" charge final image, filtering through POV's whisperer bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (careful exposure) signaled early, escalates via dream mapping → dive → group testimony under accum lens, with agency in inviting dreamers; cost unmistakable in "gentle blade... heal without infection" and foreclosed shout path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of salvaged truth emerges organically from tapping patterns and globe hymn, reweighting silence-to-surface via final image's resonant rest without moralizing; ambiguity in "exposure is a gentle blade" invites counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("language of silt, steel, and memory") and rhythmic modulation (short insistent sentences at dive: "quick, careful, insistent") sustain single first-person POV under pressure, with purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density ("tapping two fingers as if keeping time... mapped... dots and dashes") propels without loops or scaffolds; figurative coherence in whisperer voice ("cabins gape like pulled teeth") varies rhythm, no muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Snow globe as Morse lifeboat and dream-tapping synthesis transforms ghost story tropes boldly; risk in poetic accumulative structure heightens gentle exposure stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
