<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied shoulder throbs and contradictory laughter amid sorrow, rooting motivation in survivor spite; micro-choices like perturbing current and pressing shoulder to glass reveal values under ache-pressure. Final vow to remain awake earns endurance with grief-cost. Minor slip: fewer distinct contradictory impulses acting simultaneously versus layered summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cooling breakers to basin reveal and drift, culminating in Charged Poise CR where "grip forming in the dark" reconfigures hunt with hush-cost felt in "heart from burning up." Orientation anchors early (observatory over valley). One tightening via perturbation suffices; cost legible in final vow image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Geode and shoulder constrain choices (holds to glass, blazes corridor), charging final vigil; breakers' clicks and moth-light integrate tactilely into action, mirroring internal pooling. Sensory hierarchy (throbs over visuals) reflects physicist bias. No white-room: spatial drift tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt unused potential) signaled early, tightens texturally via basin unspooling and shoulder blaze narrowing to "coordinates... like a dare." Agency in sequence-run and tilt forecloses pretense with grief-price. Minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9-band; cost unmistakable in "ferries grief aboard."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pooling potential emerges organically from geode facets and basin lift, reweighting grief into "bleak exhilaration" without statement; final "wounded hymn" answers hunt's question non-literally, lingering ambiguity of mercy. No moralizing; irony in commander's misread charges resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (bruise/geode metaphors, "intangibly tangible") biases noticing toward slack/forces; rhythmic prose modulates from held-breath waits to blaze-corridor intensity without leakage. Single POV stable, voice as character in "laughter tries to grow where sorrow sits."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines like "knock the panel... basin appears" propel via varied rhythm; purposeful "pools" motif avoids loops. Minor overwriting in sustained figuratives (e.g., "purple cathedral") risks coherence but pattern-taught pays off without closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of survivor oracle hunting slack via perturbation transforms drone trope into lyric sci-fi; geode-basin lift feels inevitable from early motifs. Bold textural risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
