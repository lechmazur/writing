<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exiled tutor's motivation to learn "how difficult beauty survives" compels chess micro-choices and stone placement, earning surrender with exile's cost; girl's precise silence reveals character through knight path and taps, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as silences and chess density build to Charged Poise closure when stone fits and hum resolves into "quiet chords," reconfiguring covenant with felt cost of potential re-exile; oriented early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nexus monoliths and "field lines sang" constrain choices via resonance that nexus "listens" to endgame, charging final "hopeful melancholy" image; selective sensory hum and twilight filter POV priorities purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of settling nexus via silence-translation tightens accumulatively to endgame offer "king and bishop versus lone pawn," forcing surrender trade-off with judgment cost legible in "her family would return at dawn."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "quiet is not absence, only a move held back" emerges from chess silences and covenant shadow, resonating in non-literal final image of "frequencies fade into a hopeful melancholy" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "counting rain by its absences" and rhythmic prose modulate with pressure, stable first-person POV; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess tutor decoding magnetic silences transforms exile trope via nexus covenant, with "surrender done on purpose might be a kind of song" risking bold perceptual ingenuity heightening stakes organically.</comment>
