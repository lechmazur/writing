<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilias's skepticism manifests as doubt that enables listening, shown in his refusal of the broker's quick flood, earning his commitment to sidereal patience with visible cost of ongoing labor. Woman and broker apply targeted pressure, revealing his realistic imagination through micro-choices like angling the box. Minor abstractness in embodied emotion ("thirst he could not drink") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumbs accumulate density, pattern taught early, tightening to unsticking voices and refusal, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "patience was not waiting but remembering together" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost of sustained defiance. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one continuous wandering scene fits defaults. No slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dry fountains and tiled plazas constrain choices (e.g., box fits "circle of light to stone"), charging final image of trickle and promise; sensory details (cracked lips, lime-streaked cheeks, vapor on tile) filter through Ilias's priorities, evolving with unsticking. Micro-setting of box-as-tool guides path without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate without spilling) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via broker's temptation—"urging a quick flood"—forcing refusal that forecloses easy relief with cost of slow repair visible in repaired plaque. One tightening suffices; agency in waiting crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sidereal patience emerges via particulars (geese pause, breadcrumbs), reweighting in ending image—"defiant hush around him sounded like promise"—without moralizing; woman's question "whether skepticism could glow without burning the past" offers non-literal answer, charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (doubting listener notices glimmers, whispers); voice modulates rhythmically, poetic diction purposeful and taught early. Dialogue natural/subtextual (broker scoffs, swallows at grandmother's image); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm ("colors trod the ground like barefoot children"); minor paraphrase loops ("realistically imaginative" repeats twice) and metaphor density in peaks deduct without touching closure. Read-aloud ear strong, no artifacts dull ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fable-quest with light-reflections as invisible breadcrumbs transforms drought-tale tropes; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes in patience's redefinition, inevitable in hindsight via box's evolving keys.</comment>
