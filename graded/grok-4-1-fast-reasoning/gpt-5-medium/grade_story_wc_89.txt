<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory reluctance and choice to open "a seam beneath the ribs" earn the metamorphosis with embodied cost, rooted in beast-whisperer traits and Mira's loss; Mira's practical "half-hand" and question pressure the bond without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as scent-density builds to RR closure in "bond hums, paradoxically steady," with legible cost in lost voice; single scene anchors early ("fairy-tale orchard"), pattern taught without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's "apples shining like moons within the moon" and beasts' "velvet feet" constrain choices (passage granted, sing at climax) and charge final "moonlight settling... like snowfall"; sensory scents filter through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) escalates via spice-conjuring to Mira's demand and narrator's agency ("I choose the first"), narrowing to metamorphosis cost under textural lens; "orchard answers with... loss" makes price unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of bonds as "bridge of breaths" emerges from spice-knitting and refraction image, reweighting grief without morals; final "quiet star threaded through two throats" resonantly answers via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias ("grammar of breathing with things that do not breathe") modulates rhythm under pressure; stable first-person elides backstory purposefully, paid in closure seam-opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("wind braids itself with steam and scent"); no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence (scent/passages) taught early without muddle in peak "body answers by opening a seam."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spices, beasts, phoenix ash into scent-conjure bond refracts fairy-tale tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens "cosmic intimacies" stakes, inevitable in hindsight refraction revelation.</comment>
