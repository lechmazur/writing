<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cartomancer's traits shine through particular actions like spilling phone screens as bones and measuring diagonals, earning the final practice with visible humility cost; narrator's curiosity embodied in tactile learning without stock epiphanies. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in accepting chipped payments versus refusal lesson.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via vignette density building to CR closure in "ribbon festival" image, reweighting paths with conceptual cost of non-monetary value; orientation anchored early in loft/rain/post-crash world, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Loft, rainlight, onyx ink, and tape constrain choices (e.g., tape hissing down stairs to mural), charging final image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific, post-crash city tactile and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping surviving patterns tightens accumulatively through client vignettes, narrowing to woman's chorus-seeking with felt cost in faded wristbands/chipped buttons; agency in reverse-engineering tests commitment without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of value in multiplied paths emerges implicitly via client particulars, final image offering non-literal resonance on cultural survival without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (rain as grandmother, cracks as language); rhythmic control modulates with vignette intensity, stable single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (onyx absorbing rainlight) propels without loops or muddle; minor figurative density in peak client beats contained, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy as post-crash urban reverse-engineering transforms tropes organically; risk in mosaic vignettes heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
