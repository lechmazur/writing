<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory "carefully reckless" impulses act in stele memory and composing micro-choices, earning joint coda revision with relational vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as promise density triggers Lio's emergence and room overtones; RR closure in "shoulders lowered" and shared revision reconfigures trust with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archive's "shelves sighed" and "throats" constrain page placement and enable overtone response, charging final "archive breathe" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trust restoration stake deepens via Lio's brittle reading narrowing to shared revision; agency in quill offer forces crystallization with "fears blurred" cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Trust as choreography of shoulders turning" emerges implicitly; final "door held open by joined hands" reweights silence/vows non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Linguistic-musical signature ("heart fugueing," "stave recorded a promise") biases perception consistently; sparse dialogue subtextual in Lio's "silence was the only sentence."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors cohere in musical braid without muddle; minor density dip in reflection passes BRR as interleaved with quill dips, but slight figurative prevalence in buildup limits perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symphonies-of-truth frame transforms linguistic tropes organically; risk in responsive archive heightens stakes to charged collaboration.</comment>
