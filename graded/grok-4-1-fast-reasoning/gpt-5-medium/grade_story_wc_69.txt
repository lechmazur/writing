<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Mara's "expectantly resigned" readiness for failure yet persistent offering of breath earn the final conducting choice; Rafi/Ola rosette exchange forces relational crucible with visible unclenching cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to Charged Poise closure in "silence landed like a bird that trusts an open palm," reconfiguring harmony stake with conceptual unlearning cost; rosette slip provides one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rosette as micro-setting constrains Rafi/Ola choice and charges final passing image; "velvet library listened too, curtains like patient throats" purposefully mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of braiding voices tightens texturally via Rafi/Ola flashes to rosette catch, narrowing relational options; performance taps coinciding forecloses hatred path with unclenching cost legible in fist image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final rosette passing offers resonant non-literal answer to unlearning question, reweighting "subtracting noise" motif through warmed circle without moralizing; emerges organically from rehearsal particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic compressions like "smoke in his tone" remains stable under performance pressure; first-person distance controlled, modulating rhythm to charge closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulative beats, but minor "subtracting noise" paraphrase loop across three instances slightly dulls mid-rehearsal propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choir as unlearning hatred crucible transforms healing trope through rosette's inherited vanishing specificity; risk-taking lyric compression heightens stakes inevitably toward final image.</comment>
