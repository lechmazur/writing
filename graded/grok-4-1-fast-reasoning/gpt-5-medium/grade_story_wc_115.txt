<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory skepticism versus pattern-tracking impulses act in wheel-turning micro-choices; final wheel forgiveness earns stasis with embodied muscular cost in "Weight arrived in my arms, not from guilt, but from the stubborn metal of intention."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds pattern density from radio mapping to valve sigh, landing CR closure where resetting wheel reconfigures truth with legible cost: "Normal means are heavy; they sit in the muscle."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Beaded valve wheel constrains appraisal and charges final reset image; sensory details like "breath tasted of iron" and drip metronome reflect steel-trusting POV bias under drowsy pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to measure swallowed truth deepens accumulatively via wheel-turn agency against radio/echo interruptions; cost unmistakable in arms' weight foreclosing ghostly belief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "stepped into the cold morning like a man leaving a shift" offers resonant CR reweighting ghost shift as mechanical habit, embracing skepticism's complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("relics of pressure and leverage as my bible") and rhythmic compression in tension ("The pipe behind it sighed, a tired lung") hold stable POV under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax to closure propulsion ("I forgave the wheel, and I set it back to open, and the sigh unknotted"); purposeful bead/rosary pattern coherent without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes psychic calls and valve physics into fresh skeptic's ghost-hunt, transforming trope via "habit of force" with lyric risk paying off in charged final poise.</comment>
