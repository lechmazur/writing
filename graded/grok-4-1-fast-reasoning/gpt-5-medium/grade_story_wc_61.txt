<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—loving too hard yet practicing loosening—act in scene via rubbing the gear before pinging and placing it in the child's palm, earning the final endurance of tending with visible cost in patience. Interiority concrete and particular through embodied images like "cold faith of metal." No unearned epiphanies; flaws like fearing heirloom status complicate choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden tending to visitor transit, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "I will touch the gear and begin the sonar pinging once more," reconfiguring generational patterns with conceptual cost of infinite patience. Orientation anchored early in nebula garden. One tightening via child/captain secrets suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nebula garden and falling petals constrain choices (no flame, sonar use) and charge final image of witnessing "across the quiet sigh of falling petals." Sensory hierarchy via POV: petals' "sighs a hush," sonar clicks selective and urgent. Details evolve causally with ships' heat curling petals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break fire/fear inheritance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through visitor secrets and child's counting, forcing captain's humility with felt cost in lowered head. Agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses fiery path on-page. Cost unmistakable in "practice loosening" against love's tightness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of light-without-fire emerges organically from particulars like cool petal glow vs. ship heat, reweighted in final image of gear-touched pinging without moral state. Generational patterns complicate without tidy resolution; child's "quiet shaped like yes" offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in echoing syntax ("patterns echo across blood as much as across starfields") biases noticing resonances; rhythmic control modulates from serene hush to insistent pings under visitor pressure. Stable first-person; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Do not feed this place flame").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "petals fall like slow comets, their sighs a hush" advances setting/atmosphere/motif); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherent and pattern-taught (echoes, infinity), no muddle in peak transit beat. Propulsion aligns with accumulative hush-to-insistence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi nebula orchard with sentimental calculus transforms tropes via sonar-light and gear-heirloom; risk in lyric cyclical structure heightens stakes of infinite patience. Final reconfiguration of sparks' descendants feels inevitable from early patterns.</comment>
