<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Precognitively forgetful trait shown through concrete micro-choices like arranging driftwood for tomorrow-self and loving fading chalk lines, embodying contradictory impulses of capture and release; final acceptance of the cycle earns closure with visible cost in ongoing forgetting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of echoes/fog building to Charged Poise CR at "felt almost possessed by time," reweighting premise of memory with conceptual cost of perpetual misplacement; orientation anchored early in garden/tide, one continuous scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog, tide, and statues (anchors/whale ribs) constrain tactics—driftwood bobs/rearranges under tide, chalk turns to milk on metal—and charge final image of veiled shoulders; selective sensory bias (tremor in wrists, salt-counting) mirrors POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture aging's sound tightens texturally via growing low note and returning echo threaded with "gull-stitch and rust-hum," narrowing to endurance at toppled head; agency in chalking/arranging forces trade-off, cost felt in bobbing markers and unmade future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tidal memory/forgetting emerges organically from particulars like chalked lines fading and driftwood compass, resonant CR in final reset offering non-literal accompaniment without moralizing; reweights prior images (echoes as prayer) with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature—noticing "magnetic dreams" and "filament humming between ribs"—modulates rhythm from hush to thick air under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors (chalk dust to milk, fog unstitches) propel accumulatively without loops; minor density of figuratives slightly slows mid-beat selection but coherence holds to closure image unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of junkyard prophet chalking ship-anchor statues to bottle aging's sound transforms time/memory tropes via tidal logic; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "salt-thread pulling... like a tide."</comment>
