<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied trembling certainty and contradictory impulses toward patterns versus openness, culminating in earned renunciation at "folded the maps until they lost borders"; micro-choices like pressing the punch into fear reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Flawless single-POV execution avoids therapy-speak, rooting change in prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density from arrows/punch to fortress mouth, teaching mosaic pattern early; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with conceptual cost in "patterns loosened, and arrows...braided into invitations," reweighting premise without contradiction. Orientation anchored immediately at cobblestones/midnight; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurrent mist/stars/puddles constrain choices (stars seal, fog pools as eyes) and charge final image (stars as lanterns); sensory hierarchy (clockwork clicks, coal whisper) filters through cartographic POV, evolving causally without white-room vagueness. Micro-objects like punch function as setting, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fortress of truths) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening—whisper's dare forces punch into fear, narrowing to unbuttoning with felt cost in confronting disappointed faces; agency in folding maps forecloses pattern-clinging path under Accumulative lens. Minor abstractness softens one tightening's visceral edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns as avoidance emerges organically from particulars (maps' spaces, punch holes), resonating in non-literal final image of hung unsaid words promising "kinder measures" that reweights prior omissions without moralizing. Subtext in mouth's "they keep you" charges ambiguity fruitfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via cartographic diction ("compass with curiosity," "skinscape") and rhythmic modulation under pressure; sparse dialogue (smoke conductor, mouth) carries subtext and advances subtly. Stable first-person focalization teaches poetic compression early, paying off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short clicks amid long images), high density integrates action/atmosphere; purposeful metaphor pattern (arrows, constellations) avoids muddle, but minor synonym churn in "mist/fog" and arrow recurrences borders loop without fully escalating closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic surrealism transforms journey trope into pattern-unraveling fortress, with punch/train as inevitable inflections from established traits; bold lyric risk heightens stakes organically, feeling singular without derivative echoes.</comment>
