<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Artist's motivation rooted in mentor's debt intensifies through micro-choices like offering double payment; child's mischief forces tactical shift via chant. Interiority embodied in "debt pulsed inside every color" and rib-catching line. Minor flaw: elders feel stock, lacking pressure on pivotal decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry braid densifies echoes into shared price demand, child's chant reconfigures dispersal. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "spires colored by fragments" with felt cost of surrendered shades. Orientation anchored in opening lines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain choices, carrying/bending poetry to name terms; bottle shards refract light into "shifting flags" charging climax. Sensory hierarchy poetic yet tactile via "vibration climb the palm." Recurring spire evolves from warning to tinted dancer, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframing forgiveness price) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via echo demand for shades and child's math dividing it. Artist's agency in sessions and double offer forces trade-off; cost legible in "weight unclench." One deepening sufficient, charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared forgiveness emerges via braid of stories tinting spire, resolving in non-echoing breeze as "wind that goes forward." Final image reweights single-voice silence into collective dispersion without moral state. Resonance from particulars like gold of mentor's morning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in refracting motifs ("split its burden among voices") stable in third-close POV; no head-hopping. Child's dialogue distinct in rhyme/whisper, goal-driven to divide price. Rhythmic control modulates hush to hum under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors integrated into action (e.g., "echoes refracted the braid into veils"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in stacked images during poetry ("bright, some bruised") slightly blurs peak beat, but lyric mode taught early. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic ritual subverted by collective color-sharing and child's chant-math transforms forgiveness trope organically. Risky lyric fantasy premise with bone towers feels inevitable in hindsight; bold echo-to-breeze reconfiguration heightens stakes.</comment>
