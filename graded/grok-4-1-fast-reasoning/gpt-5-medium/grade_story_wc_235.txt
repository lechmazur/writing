<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in bargaining with nostalgia creature ("trading the envy... for a promise of continuity"), earning final renunciation of resurrection with embodied cost in jaded coffee flavor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream density reconfigures dates into switchbacks; CR lands on-page at "scroll lay... arranged into a map" with conceptual cost of non-resurrection but aligned beginnings/endings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurrent kettle hisses and birch scroll constrain choices (tracing under jealousy, packing as "language can bleed"), charging final frost-framed ridge view.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to distill chaos tightens texturally via dream layering and bargaining trade-off, with agency-driven cost legible in "did not resurrect myself; I only gave my endings a place to meet my beginnings for coffee."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of patrolling "day after my own funeral" non-literally answers chaos-to-narrative question, reweighting nostalgia via aligned scroll without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "letters climbed off the bark like ants carrying crumbs of memory"; rhythmic control modulates dream pressure without elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in lines like "Jealousy sharpened the edges of the scroll"; no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddling dream-climax propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms time/death tropes via dream chronicler autographing dreams and scroll-dates switchbacks; risky lyric structure inevitable in hindsight, heightening closure stakes.</comment>
