<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—preemptive nostalgia vs. risk of "bleed[ing] ink"—act in scene, culminating in earned personal sharing that forecloses passive binder role with embodied cost (knees tugged toward kneeling).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to pattern break at "I stepped into the crystal whispering forecourt," delivering Charged Poise RR where shadow covers shoes as legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Forecourt and shadows constrain choice (steps in, lengthens with willingness) and charge final image; selective sensory weave (chimes, steam taste, blue blades) mirrors internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (personal identity in collective) signaled early, tightens via accumulative density to agency in forecourt step; cost felt in "risk an instance that hurts the page," charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of individual-collective synthesis emerges organically from particulars (plum memory joins baker's steam); final image ("hears my name once") reweights premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (weather as ink/memory) and rhythmic control (varied lyric compression) sustain under reflective pressure; POV stable, elisions taught early and paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; purposeful figural patterns (lightning stitches, quill trembles) cohere without muddle; minor dense metaphors in buildup serve accumulative payoff untouched by closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-archiving via shadows/weather risks bold lyric frame; turns (personal offering) inevitable from particulars, transforming tropes without gimmick.</comment>
