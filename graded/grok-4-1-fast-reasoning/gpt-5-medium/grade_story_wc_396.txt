<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied, with patience as a stubborn weed revealing contradictory impulses against urgency; micro-choices like mirror reconstitution compel higher-stakes proposal. Matilde and Harun apply targeted pressure, forcing tactical shifts. Final endurance to stay earns change with felt cost of season-long commitment, scaled perfectly. Minor slip: "calmly intuitive" borders label-only without deeper tradeoff visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard's absences to mirror-assembled sphere revealing shared wound. Orientation anchors early (peacekeeper climbing to orchard above floes). Two-shard structure (store/orchard) transitions legibly; closure as Charged Poise in synchronized nods and "I would live here a season" lands RR with undeniable opportunity cost on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (brine/smoke coat, floes biting like wolves, lantern pears) filtered through narrator's intuitive bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Mirrors and shard as micro-settings constrain reconstitution choice and charge closure hover. Ice pressures crossings in proposal; orchard/lanterns evolve with gathering. Recurrent fruit/moons reweight empathy premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve light theft via shard to bridge groups) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through mirror-deepening of shared child-loss knowledge. Agency in unconventional reconstitution forces proposal tradeoffs (beacon saplings, paired watches). Pressure coheres to stance crystallization in nods; cost legible in "guilt would be compost" and season commitment. Minor abstractness in initial accusations slightly mutes visceral onset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconstituting wholeness via patience emerges organically from particulars (mirrors confessing seams, anomaly child insisting rules bend). Subtext in silences/gestures (Matilde's brine wipe, Harun's ground study) invites ambiguity without confusion. Final image of mirrors speaking reconfigures "courageous anomaly" to practice, answering empathy-action question non-literally with conceptual cost of sustained walking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (shadow-laced patience, trees bowing under moon-fruit) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from lyrical ascent to tense gathering. Single POV stable, no head-hopping; dialogue sparse but subtextual (Matilde's fault-ledger, Harun's watchers). Voice as character: syntax reflects intuitive drift under pressure, converging briefly at closure intentionally. Experimental compression taught early, legible at shard-hover.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "floe split with a page-turning sound" advances sound/closure cadence). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops, scaffolds, or template cadence. Figurative language pervasive but pattern-taught (reflections/seams/constellations) with payoff in sphere-hover, no muddle. Minor register elevation in "rehearse for certainty" risks academic drift but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: vintage mirrors reconstituting seer-shard transforms prophecy trope into empathy-map, with ice-orchard world logic fully committed. Bold risks (poetic accumulative drive, anomaly-as-practice reweighting) heighten stakes organically. No derivative echoes; turns inevitable from intuitive patience constraint. Final "practice, finally, is how peace keeps" feels singular vision.</comment>
