<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pretending stars are "maps forward" while hushing guilt, with embodied throat-cold memory; final self-tattoo renunciation earns closure via prior causal anchors like letters and cries, confronting refusal without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (cries, letters, recorder) builds to Charged Poise RR in self-tattoo and amber press, with legible cost in "guilt lives in waveforms" folding inward; orientation anchored early in lab/who/time folds, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lab's "floor listens back through boards" and amber constrain choices (holding to remember, pressed to shift cry), charging final image where insect "flex[es]"; sensory sound-hierarchy (ghosted frequencies, speaker static) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt dissonance) signaled early, escalates via recorder's "hush the black water" deepening to force client/self-tethering agency; cost unmistakable in pulse-crossing line through "old refusal," narrowing to inward map under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening/tethering emerges from cry-translations and glyph-letters without statement; final "sound thins" reweights premise of unheeded scream via amber's "choice to hold," resonant non-literal answer with ambiguity in "not forgiven, not yet."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct sound-biased perceptual signature ("meteor hush," "ghosted frequencies") modulates rhythmically under stress; stable first-person elides backstory strategically, paid in closure tattoo; no head-hopping, voice poetic-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "dusk that unspools like tape" advances time/atmosphere); metaphors cohere in sound-wave motif without muddle, rhythm varies read-aloud; minor figurative density in opening beat purposeful for pattern-teaching, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooing as guilt-mapping with haunted recorder/firmware transforms trope of remorseful artist; risk in lyric compression heightens inward stakes, inevitable hindsight in self-tether crossing pulse as bold reconfiguration.</comment>
