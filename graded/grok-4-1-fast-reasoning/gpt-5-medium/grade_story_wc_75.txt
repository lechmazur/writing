<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (historical orientation as curse/blessing) drive micro-choices like adopting bread method under pressure; final acceptance of lens/caretaker role earned with embodied cost of "nectar armor, sweet and unbearable."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density (wax, bread, lens) tightens to cadence shift at waterfall ritual; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost as names endure via vow/chewing, reweighting preservation premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (beeswax, damp limestone, rosewater dread) filters via historical POV, constraining choices like snail-shell ovens; recurring lens charges final image by selecting survival amid mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue arts vs. embalming fear) signaled early, deepens via lens test narrowing options; agency in baking/ritual forecloses cold history path, but stranger's arrival borders coincidental complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of warm/eaten endurance emerges organically from bread-wax-honey particulars; final image "history rises warm, eaten, and therefore enduring" offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (historical tug "like a hive-slick rope") biases noticing; stable first-person POV with rhythmic modulation under stress, minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Senka's lens explanation).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyric compression; minor figurative density ("cold lace," "pond-lit constellations") in peak waterfall beat risks overwrite but supports accumulative ear without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of baking initials to thaw wax transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in lens-as-selector pays off at closure, inevitable in hindsight via motif constraint.</comment>
