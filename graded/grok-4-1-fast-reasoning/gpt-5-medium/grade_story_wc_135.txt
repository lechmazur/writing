<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Archivist's reactively visionary trait compels concrete micro-choices like turning the valve and marking the ledger, earning endurance with felt cost in practice over monuments; woman's motivation layers via embodied tapping hesitation, revealing contradictory return impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from valve introduction to final ledger balance as Charged Poise RR; orientation anchors instantly in harbor post-exile; closure cost legible in "absences have shifted... channels navigated," reconfiguring voids into routes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's rain-beaded windows and mist constrain choices (tapping fogged pane erases water, revealing city); valve as micro-setting charges final image; sensory selection (kelp/iron, gull cries) reflects archivist's priorities without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile fragments to hearten harbor) signaled early, tightens via woman's tapping and route-tracing that narrows to practice; agency in archivist's valve-turning forecloses monument path with cost in "traces survive if we build them into practice"; lens-coherent escalation via density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Navigated absences emerge organically through valve rhythms and route curves, culminating in resonant CR where harbor "resembles a ledger finally balancing"; subtext in silence/practice avoids moralizing, reweighting return without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent first-person perceptual signature (wakes in faces, intervals as spacing) biases details toward absences; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("gives me the weather"); rhythmic modulation heightens mist-thinning beat without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short punches like "tone: none" amid lyrical flows); no loops or scaffolds dull closure—staggered intervals pattern-taught early pays off; minor figurative density in peak practice beat contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist role, valve-as-metronome, and absence-routes transforms post-exile return trope; risk in lyric compression (gull punctuations as staff lines) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via harbor's "small work like tide carries moonlight."</comment>
