<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oris's motivation to welcome nuance roots in traits like quiet thinking and telepathic currents, compelling micro-choices like threading the ampoule despite the scholar's recoil. Contradictory impulses between certainty's "tight room" and slow action act in scene, earning the final reconfiguration with patience's cost. Scholar's ripple of doubt adds pressure without diluting Oris's interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations cascade from ampoule touch to lattice pour, tightening density toward CR closure where time diffuses wide with patience's conceptual cost legible in "She felt the delay in her bones." Orientation anchors immediately in underwater garden post-secret. Single continuous scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome crack, eelgrass, and founder statue constrain threading choice and charge final breach-as-wound image. Sensory details like "anemones that wrote their astonishment in bubbles" filter through Oris's stone-water perception, evolving causally without stasis. Micro-setting guides access via structural weakness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of nuance vs. certainty signaled early escalates accumulatively through scholar's recoil and Oris's threading agency, foreclosing certainty with delay's felt cost in bone-deep patience. One deepening cascade narrows to diffusion reconfiguration under lens. Moral calculus between stall and surrender sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hesitation as incisively kind emerges organically from particulars like ampoule's tempo, reweighting certainty via final "benches for arguments yet to bloom" without moralizing. Nuance's counter-reading lingers in garden's breath and scholar's reopened window. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature of watery-stone diction ("thoughts carry like current") modulates rhythmically under revelation pressure. Purposeful compression teaches pattern early, paying off legibly at closure. No elision or hopping; voice embodies Oris infallibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and water-tide rhythm, with metaphors consistent (cascade/current) sans muddle in peak lattice pour. Zero loops or scaffolds; every line multitasks image-action-pressure. Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene, opening/final lines recharge motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned garden memory and hesitation-bottled-as-tempo transforms tropes via Oris's animate stone logic. Risky lyric accumulations heighten stakes coherently, with eelgrass threading as inevitable turn from particulars. No derivatives; vision commits boldly to underwater nuance.</comment>
