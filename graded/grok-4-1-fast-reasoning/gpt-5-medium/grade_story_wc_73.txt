<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist's contradictory impulses—hopeful persistence versus sober measurement—embody in keeping chipped die uncorrected; final renunciation of exit earned via accumulated proofs and slots addressed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through chalked lemmas and dice rolls to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "I do not step through, because to step through would flatten what I seek to keep."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains every choice as non-accumulating risers and sipping slots; final "luminous seam" charges closure image with grain of missed moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to capture texture tightens texturally via rupture pattern break, forcing endurance; refusal to exit forecloses path, cost felt in preserved "fabric woven with pause."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Regret-as-engine theme emerges via chipped die bias and proofs; resonant answer in "motion can honor stillness without ending," reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with mathematical perceptual signature ("each riser I chalk a lemma") modulates rhythm to match ascent intensity; stable single POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, no loops; "dice stop impossibly on edge, the chipped one holding the other like a shoulder" clean propulsion at peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of math proofs capturing emotional "texture" transforms infinite climb trope; risk in lawless "regret engine" heightens stakes organically.</comment>
