<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cradling...plans, held close against my chest where no one could see the trembling," compelling higher-stakes micro-choices like stalemate play; final endurance of unfinished moves earned via prior causality with embodied cost of "open ground."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to window shift and town pause; closure as Charged Poise in "we walked home slower...leaves promising shade," reconfiguring rush with conceptual cost of foreclosed haste legible in final grotto image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's iron veins make compasses "hold still against all rules," constraining setup and charging closure reprise; cobalt library pools blue on steps, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of slowing town tightens once via synchronized windows—"every window...shifted"—forcing pause that narrows rush options; cost felt in mason's midair trowel and teenager's pause, charging final slower walk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of long listening emerges organically from window questions and stalemate; final "decisions need a longer cradle" reweights premise non-literally via sidewalk leaves and shade promise, lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "hears unspoken words" and chess filters like "pawn...needles over true north"; rhythmic modulation peaks in "streets quieted until we could hear our shoes thinking," stable first-person lyric voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("mist curled like quiet music"); minor overwriting in metaphor stacks mid-grotto beat slightly dulls propulsion, but read-aloud rhythm varies and supports accumulative cadence to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy as "long listening" via windows and magnets transforms trope of town change; risk of lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via grotto's suggestive pull.</comment>
