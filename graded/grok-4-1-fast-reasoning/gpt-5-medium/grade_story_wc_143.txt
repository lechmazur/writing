<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion peaking in "the crater and the summit and the moon conspired to make my throat clean and still"; contradictory curiosity drives micro-choices like vial setup despite foreknown loss, earning final endurance without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via timed vial densities building to moth's awakening and shutter press as Charged Poise RR; orientation anchored in first paragraph; closure cost legible in moth's departure and "hush belongs to no archive but breath."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moonlit crater rim and basalt snow seam constrain choices (electronics fail, dew triggers vials) and charge final image; sensory details (slow breath, wing unfurling) filtered through POV priorities, evolving with timed flames.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph last moth for proof/preservation) signaled early and tightens accumulatively via vial cadences to white sigh reversal, narrowing to shutter agency; cost felt in moth's final hover and personal hush realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of marking irreplaceable presence amid erasure emerges organically from Nightwatch legacy and space age overwrite; final image reconfigures "outlast" premise with resonant CR cost in "hush...belongs to no archive but breath," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("fossils of our shadows," "wing like a shard of milk-glass"); rhythmic modulation builds under timed pressure, stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (vial flames as "polite throat clearing"); metaphors coherent and purposeful without muddle; rhythm varies naturally, zero loops or scaffolds, even in peak moth hover.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar sci-fi lyricism transforms space age tropes via glacier moths and chemical timers; risk-taking in accumulative hush cadence inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
