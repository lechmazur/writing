<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in "taught my hands to speak"; contradictory endurance vs. past failure (first wrong readings) earns final practice of staying with visible cost in refusal to drown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as translation pattern builds density to Charged Poise/CR closure in "we are unshaken marvels ourselves, proof that even a capsized world can learn to balance"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via first failure rectification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory's frost and glass constrain choices (sensors refract on panes) and charge final image; micro-setting of hands/forks filters through POV, e.g., "ice-limned ferns arch under glass ribs."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via first failure's "lilies blistered" deepening to weighted forks and successful choir; agency in rewriting narrows options with cost of misread grief refused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in silence emerges organically from performance images, resonant non-literal answer in "city glows in reciprocal quiet" reweighting capsized premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature biases toward translation (e.g., "heat-mapping emotions into gradients"); rhythmic control modulates intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, e.g., "sensors drew those clouds into a choir of light"; figurative coherence in lyric pattern taught early, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent thermal music post-capsize transforms tropes; bold lyric risk in "unshaken marvels" frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via conservatory lexicon.</comment>
