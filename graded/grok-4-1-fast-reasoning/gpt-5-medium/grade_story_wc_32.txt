<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in unflinching palm-to-heat amid heart-hearing sensitivity, driving contradictory impulses to final crozier snap with earned cost. Interiority concrete and particular, no stock epiphanies. Final renunciation forecloses guild path, compelled by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from approximations to frond/gate RR (Charged Poise) with legible cost in "snapped it fully... fed both halves." Orientation anchored by ~50 words (nexus, crozier). One tightening via hum/frond suffices, constraint (crozier state) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains via ashbed/grate access, embers "small decisive eyes" charge choices; sensory (warm pennies, sighing ashes) filters alchemist POV. Evolves causally (glow gathers, column lifts). Final "embers whispering against my ankles" recharges setting in closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify vs. stifling destiny) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through approximations to blade-of-light/gate; agency in snap/ step forecloses path. Cost unmistakable: "pressed my palm into the heat... cold fled into me." Persistent crozier constraint alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges via crozier-to-ash, "dismantling is only room-making" reweights prior guild calculus non-literally in gate image. Complexity in frozen bloom motif lingers without moralizing. Final "cold flower inside my ribs did not wilt" answers central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (alchemical listening: "heart hears everything," furnaces as "patient beasts"). Rhythmic diction modulates (short nudges to hoarse music swell). Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "crozier rolled an inch and the embers brightened"). No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (penny drops, hinges). Rhythm propels via varied syntax/openings, peaks clean in snap/gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical liberation via crozier ritual transforms destiny trope; "frozen bloom" synthesis inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes (palm burn as hinge-turn). No derivatives, voice commits fully.</comment>
