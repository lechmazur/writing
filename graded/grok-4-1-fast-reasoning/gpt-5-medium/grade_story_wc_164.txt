<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority shines through concrete micro-choices like listening through fingertips and whistling for the bird, rooting motivation in consistent poetic traits; contradictory impulses emerge in balancing cheerful gloom with caution at the pool vision. Final realization earned by prior tactile engagements with glass and seeds. No second character, so relational bullets N/A; fully individual voice without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation (recollectionist in geode cave today) clear by paragraph 2; density builds via seeds, pool, and shepherd vision to CR closure ("paths closed its eyes because the earth was blinking") with conceptual cost of trust over certainty. One tightening at pool vision suffices; single scene fits defaults, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Iridescent cave and crater glass constrain choices (e.g., pressing glass to pool reveals shepherd), charging final image; sensory details (light as patient fish, seeds trembling into commas) selectively POV-filtered and purposeful. Atmosphere's cheerful gloom mirrors internal states without overt symbolism; spatial choreography coherent in one location.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths disappear) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bird seeds to pool deepening and shepherd reversal, narrowing to renunciation of direct path with cost (respecting beast's sleep). Agency in conjecturing and scattering seeds; visible price in edited paths as caretakers charges ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of disappearances as trust emerges organically from particulars (folding path, newborn beast); final CR image ("secret architecture under every useful disappearance") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in images like seeds as question marks invites ambiguity; protagonist's arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "vowels weep," "heat hums in a key between sorrow and laughter") biases noticing poetically; stable first-person POV with rhythmic control modulates intensity without head-hopping. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure; prose reflects contemplative mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Deadlines are sandglasses held by polite ghosts tapping their shoes" advances stakes and voice); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density voice-motivated in lyric mode with payoff (seeds as commas charge closure); minor simile stacks coherent, no muddle in peak vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recollectionist harvesting memories via transliteration in geode transforms tropes (missing paths as caretakers); risk-taking in poetic metaphors (e.g., "path folds like a sleeping kite") heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established pattern; no derivatives, fully committed premise.</comment>
