<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation rooted in embodied echoes of crimes intensifies compellingly to the earned choice to stay; contradictory impulses (clean slate vs. lingering ledger) act in the truth-speaking beat. Interiority particular via muscle memory stains and slogan-engineering confession. Caretaker's pressure reveals values without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from newspaper cues to descent and Charged Poise closure ("I chose to stay"); orientation anchored early in city/post-procedure frame. One tightening via warming baseball forces truth, narrowing to fork with felt cost (friction, ache). No lens ambiguity; cost legible in ledger lightening and skiff tie.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake and skiff constrain choices (paddle strokes draw comets, knock ripples); jars flicker faces charging truth beat and final image. Sensory hierarchy (ear for regret chords, cooling air) reflects urgency; details evolve causally (glow blushes, brightens to bruise). Micro-setting (melted signs hull) mirrors city decay inventively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early tightens accumulatively to truth revelation and stay-decision, foreclosing escape with cost (useful ache). Agency in ear-guided doors, risk-payment paddle, and fork crystallization; moral calculus between cleaner hands or ferrying others viscerally felt. One deepening via machine exhale suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via friction emerges from particulars (slogans sold indifference, lake stains kindly); final image reweights clean slate to ledger without moralizing. Subtext in caretaker shrug and time-traveler paradox invites ambiguity; no tidy binary, protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (jaded wonder filtering neon fog, blushing rock) biases noticing; rhythmic compression modulates to peak truth beat. Dialogue subtextual ("pay with risk, not with lies") advances goal; clean first-person stability, no leakage. Voice reflects stressed mind (eyes water like guilt steam).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "paddle stroke drew comet tail" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops despite poetic reuse ("delicately robust"). Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (homing moon, healed bruise) during descent slightly dulls propulsion but spares closure. Zero scaffolds; propulsion fits accumulative rise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Time-traveler baseball paradox and pain-dreaming machine synthesize fresh premise organically; newspaper negative space transforms tropes into stakes driver. Risky poetic descent heightens without gimmick; hindsight inevitability in paradox steadying oar, no derivative echoes.</comment>
