<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied contradiction in "gloomy cheerfulness like a raincoat, patched with jokes," driving micro-choices like thinking of disproved stories to steady compass; final endurance of cheerful gloom earned with visible cost in riddle's unclenching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hums densify resonance to Charged Poise CR at "riddle unclenches like a fist," reconfiguring certainty to kindness-as-gravity with conceptual cost legible in final image of shell blushing and gulls circling unsolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory dome "replies with a throat full of star-dust," constraining cello play; shell/cello micro-setting evolve tactilely (warms, cools, packed like bandaged child), charging closure image without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Riddle stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via crooked bow drawing figure, protagonist agency forces melodic collaboration; cost unmistakable in "fist" unclenching, foreclosing certainty path under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of myth-retelling to kindness emerges organically from cello hums and figure's melody, resonant non-literal answer in "kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity" reweights prior sky conversations without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing like "universe winced at falsehood"; rhythmic compression modulates with pressure in peak play, stable single POV with purposeful lyric elision taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm matching hums, but minor figurative muddle in peak ("stitched smile," "vowels he cannot pronounce") risks coherence without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Bold lyric synthesis of myth-busting as cello-resonant retelling transforms tropes organically; "ephemeral compass spins without moving" turn inevitable from particulars, risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
