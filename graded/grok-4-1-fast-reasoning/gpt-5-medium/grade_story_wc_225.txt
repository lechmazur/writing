<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the center choice between full release (brilliant sacrifice) or increments, earned by chess backstory tilting present pulls; final renunciation leaves pigeons frozen as self-imposed cost, embodying tutor flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of thread pulls building to RR closure: incremental tightening/loosening reconfigures time with cost (pigeons wait, ashes taste on wrong pulls); orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth and tapestry threads constrain choices (trace droplets, knight counts, tug specifics) and charge final overflow image; body/setting filter via chess patterns sharpens perceptual hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early tightens at center via agency in knight-paced pulls narrowing to incremental path; cost legible in tasted ashes and left pigeons under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pauses/choices emerges implicitly from chess-tutored regrets to incremental release; final image (overflow, pigeons) offers non-literal answer reweighting sacrifice's cost without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (chess patterns in stillness, L-shaped counts) with rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable first-person focalization biases noticing frayed threads and stalled rain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "tugged gently, and air stirred"); figurative weave coherent without muddle, varied rhythm; minor density elevation mid-beats but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess tutoring time via threads in frozen weave; risk of lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in pigeons' wait echoing kingdom burn.</comment>
