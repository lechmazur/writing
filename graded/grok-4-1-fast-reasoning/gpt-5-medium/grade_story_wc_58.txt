<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to map healing geography drives peculiar method and projection ritual, with embodied contradiction in "walled and windowed inside me"; woman's transformation from ache to irrigated slope earned via thread and obituary. Closure choice (gifting thread) forecloses old grief with felt relational cost. Minor abstraction in epiphanies avoids 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds from garden hush to projection bridge and final weeping image as Charged Poise RR, reweighting absence with conceptual cost in "small inland sea awaiting tide." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by first paragraph harbor/garden. Persistent thread constraint shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden micro-setting (quince bruising fragrant, cracked fountain) constrains intimacy and ritual, mirroring internal states via "leaves like small coins spending their shine"; recurring thread charges final image as pilgrim trail. Sensory hierarchy (copper/kelp taste) reflects narrator's perceptual bias; evolves causally with woman's arrival and quince drop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explaining latitude absence) signaled early, escalates texturally via thread hum → projection encounter → obituary writing, narrowing to woman's stance crystallization with on-page cost in productive weeping and shoulder slope. Agency in ritual choices drives deepening; moral calculus of presence vs. gap charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of navigable absence emerges organically from thread mapping pauses and projection bridge, culminating in non-literal final image of "stubborn brilliance of leaving things" reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in woman's "latitude crueler" and obituary's inland sea invites ambiguity; protagonist arc inextricable from healing geography.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature ("grief has seasonality") modulates rhythm with pressure, from hushed garden to taut thread hum; dialogue subtextual ("he is in all of them and in none") pursues goals. Stable first-person POV with clean free indirect; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety (short taut sentences in projection: "We speak without mouth or wind"); figurative pattern (threads, bridges, maps) coherent and voice-motivated, no muddle or loops obscuring closure. Propulsion aligns with beats, opening/final lines recharge motifs; minor synonym shine/hush contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituary-for-living premise with sea-learned projection and humming thread transforms absence trope into healing geography, risking lyrical compression that heightens stakes. Turns (man’s crooked key reveal) inevitable from ritual; bold voice commits to premise without retreat, no derivative echoes.</comment>
