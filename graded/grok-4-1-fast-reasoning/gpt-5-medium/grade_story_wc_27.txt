<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via rust-as-constellations and father's echoes; micro-choices like ear-to-deckplates and palm-circuit embody motivation. Final endurance—carrying compass-rhythm—earned by prior causal build, with knees-giving release as cost. Contradictory non-fighter seeking truths acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tremor→door→hum→circuit tightens to star-map CR, reweighting Lark's fate with risk-cost ("risk waking whoever silenced them"). Orientation anchored by para 2 (Mara in bay post-lull). Closure image—projected map—pays off pattern with undeniable release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains: deckplate-tremor guides to stone-ring; rust-nicks sharpen via glasses into sky-map charging closure. Sensory hierarchy (vibration-priority) reflects stargazer bias. Evolving details (groan, flaring lines) mirror internal hum-build without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lark's path amid lull) signaled para 1; density escalates via hum-circuit to map-reveal, narrowing from personal echo-hunt to shared navigation with risk-cost legible ("heat prickling"). Agency in palms-on-stones forecloses isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (meaning via right question) emerges from stone-breath dialogue and map-spill; final "courage to ask...hums back" reweights mess-to-orientation without statement. Resonance from particulars like scrap-map fluttering pointless. No moralizing; ambiguity in rebellion-pause lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature: industrial-glim as sky-constellations. Voice texture modulates rhythm with pressure (short breaths at circuit-close). Lyric compression taught early (rust-prophecies), paid in chrono-ribbon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "awkwardly confident" echoes trait in action). Varied rhythm propels (short siren chirp vs. slow hum-convo); metaphors cohere (leviathan-bay to thunderous-serenity). No loops/artifacts; closure-image clear.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ancient stone-altar in sci-fi bay hums grief-to-map, transforming rebellion trope via stargazer-mess. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes; hindsight-inevitable from rust-constellations seed.</comment>
