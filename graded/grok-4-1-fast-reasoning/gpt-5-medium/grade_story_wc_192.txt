<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tender shadow keeper's motivation roots deeply in embodied scars and bridge-burning stewardship, compelling the teaching choice with student; internal endurance shows contradictory solitude vs. duty acting in the joint doorknocker lift. No stock epiphanies, but lacks simultaneous impulses clashing in a peak beat like the girl's crater gaze. Final palm-link and step-aside earn renunciation with cost to keeper's isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from door-knock tremble to smoke-shapes, threshold brightening, and girl's unescorted cross as Charged Poise RR with keeper's felt endurance cost in "scars for the next translation." Orientation anchors by line 10; single scene tightens meaningfully via shadows-to-student progression without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary, bare feet, moonwater-cool ring constrain choices (palms link scars via door); starlit hush and dust-breath mirror internal states tactilely, charging final hush-refill image. Sensory hierarchy (cool chill, ringing ears) selective via POV urgency; no white-room, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach breath to lodged past) signaled early, texturally escalates via encroaching shadows to crater-girl's permission-denial standoff, narrowing to unescorted cross with agency/endurance cost in keeper's hooded-lighthouse witness. One deepening suffices; moral calculus (clear crossing courtesy) sharpens peak palm-press.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship-through-absence emerges via bridge-ash particulars shifting to girl's weather/crater distinction, reweighting in non-literal "prayer" of no-look-back without moral state. Subtext in smoke-shapes' hover invites ambiguity on owing vs. owning; final silhouettes-stepping resonates as CR with conceptual debt cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (fire-river-scar metaphors) biases noticing toward thresholds/breath; rhythmic compression modulates from ringing-silence to exhale, stable close-first POV with no leakage. Brief spoken clarification to shadows goal-driven; prose-as-mind reflects resolute keeper under hush-pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "burns bridges carefully, collecting the ash" advances motive/atmosphere); metaphors cohere in fire/ash/breath pattern without muddle, varying rhythm passes ear-test. Minor figurative density in teaching beat taught early, propels to closure; no loops or scaffolds dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Door-without-house and scar-linking synthesize fresh lyric frame on endurance, transforming bridge-burning trope via ash-proof stewardship; risk in loaded-emptiness poise heightens stakes organically. Final scar-prep feels inevitable hindsight from opening ring-lift.</comment>
