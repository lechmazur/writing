<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chaste courtesan's motivation to defy conformity roots in disciplined chastity, shown through embodied micro-choices like "bodily poetic" restraint; internal conflict in withholding touch amid ritual pressure earns final climb back with city's pulse. Contradictory impulses act in underground quickening under patrol threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of threads/echoes tightening to closure's Conceptual Repricing: city "inhaled differently" reconfigures conformity's rule-set, cost legible in shrinking "window between sigh and smile" and patrol pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow and prism constrain choices—bowl in snow, threads from snowlight—and charge final image where prism "rang like a bell made of dew"; selective sensory filter (breath as birds, frost runes) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ritual vs. detection) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via patrol feet and pupil-shrinking time, forcing agency in rethreading with felt cost of snagging panic; closure crystallizes stance with undeniable city-wide reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of freeing hidden voices from conformity emerges via particulars like forgotten-vow threads; final image's "learning slowly how to refuse and still sing" offers non-literal resonance reweighting echoes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction ("toe-writing a measured rune"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to "plucked string" tremble under stress, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax, but minor overwrite density in metaphors during peak threading ("grammar of wrists and knuckles") slightly dulls clarity without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan ritual as thread-untangling rebellion transforms fantasy tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via motif evolution to city pulse.</comment>
