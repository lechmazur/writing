<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in knees folding then strengthening via confession, compelling shadow sacrifice with embodied cost; grandmother's teaching roots motivation without abstraction; no safety-hedging in flaw confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds ritualistically to RR closure in shadow's departure and light's tether; orientation anchored by ~100 words; pivotal "shadow step away" images undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Chamber's glyphs, brass ribs, and rafters constrain ritual choices and charge final patina bloom; sensory hierarchy (tin/pears hush) reflects repairman's perceptual bias; micro-setting (tuning box) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens texturally via rust demand, confession, tether offer to shadow forfeiture under Accumulative lens; agency crystallizes stance with legible ongoing cost; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening vs ownership emerges implicitly via tether image reweighting light as borrowed; final rafter labor offers non-literal resonance without moralizing; particulars like sold lullaby earn complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("melodies that bruise like fruit," "gears that remember") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens ritual pressure; stable first-person with no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud with purposeful lyric compression; high density advances texture, but minor fig-lang density in peak ritual ("high note like sunrise trembled") borders overwrite without muddle; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of horology mythos transforms tropes (light theft) via rust covenant and shadow collateral; tinkersong frame risks bold perceptual idiom heightening stakes organically.</comment>
