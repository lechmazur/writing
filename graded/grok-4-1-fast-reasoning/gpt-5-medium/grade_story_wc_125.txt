<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the mirror chamber where past knots are feared yet forgiven through pressing the rope, earning the final braiding choice with visible emotional cost; interiority concrete via tasted silt and metal-tongue ripple. Flaws complicate without hedging, shown in heroic self-deception confronted on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layers uncover density in visions and patterns, culminating in CR closure where rope warms with consent in the mirror, reweighting past with undeniable forgiveness cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto walls, dust footprints, and stalagmite constrain choices like looping rope and uncovering layers, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (violet arithmetic, silt taste) filters through poet's biased noticing, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to texture time tightens texturally via ripple-vision and mirror, narrowing to self-forgiveness trade-off with felt cost in "knots I tied to seem heroic"; agency in vow and pressing rope forecloses cutting-away path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's alibis and playful ethics emerges implicitly through silt-taste and canyon visions, resonant CR in braiding past without moral statement; final image reweights heroic knots with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-metaphors and rhythmic syntax modulates with intensity, stable first-person lyric voice; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines propels texturally, but figurative layering in most sentences risks minor coherence strain in peak mirror beat without full payoff; no loops, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet-rope-time textures with clock-prison and energy-being visions transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via mile-marker constellations.</comment>
