<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's affectionate skepticism shines in her sleeve brush testing reality and murmur "It might just be art tricking us, but the trick is helping me breathe," driving contradictory impulses that yield to steady taps and unflinching recall with embodied softening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as somatic density and light patterns build to Charged Poise closure in forehead press and dull geode on sill, reconfiguring regrets with legible cost of expended inner light; continuous scene oriented early, one tightening post-shock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Studio rig sparks shock nipping calves and geode flashes "like layered pages" constrain wand passes and memory triggers, charging final sill image; rain veins and camera integrate purposefully without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake to illuminate regret pathways signaled early tightens accumulatively via shock reversal and misread rhythm "chest tightened," forcing endurance to steady signals with cost of faced morphine fragment and penciled map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kindness-as-method emerges implicitly from geode-seeded light corridors and somatic grammar, resonating in topography "a river made when it forgave a field" without moralizing; reweights doubt via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical "we" voice with electricity/light perceptual signature modulates rhythm post-shock "laughed thinly, then counted down," stable POV distance; purposeful poetic compression taught early remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels with varied openings and syntax breathing with breaths/taps, but figurative saturation in memory beats ("color settled into cobalt," "curved like a bird") risks minor overload without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light painting, pill-tuned somatics, and geode transforms telepathy into memory topography, with bold lyric risks heightening stakes in unspooling paths and dull reprise.</comment>
