<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to correct lies roots in family ties and intensifies through discoveries, earning the final sharing with engineer; interiority concrete via embodied senses like "lantern glass polished by rain." Contradictory serenity amid upheaval acts in micro-choices like packing papers calmly. Minor reflection exceeds 20% but anchors to present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (box contents, family links) builds to CR closure in "We pushed off together... canal unfolded a truer city," reweighting lies with conceptual cost of walked path. Orientation anchors early (canal, skiff, lock by para 1). One tightening via pattern visibility suffices; cost legible in engineer's "pay came steady."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canal, skiff, slime-green seal constrain choices (hook into darkness, ease box onto step) and charge final ripples "like new lines on a map." Sensory hierarchy (visible breath, grating complaint) reflects watery urgency; POV bias filters via professional instincts. Micro-setting sundial evolves tactilely, mirroring internal clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage proofs for truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ledger margins changing knowledge to family pattern; agency in pulling box and confronting engineer forecloses lie-paved road with serene cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in shared departure; one tightening reweights options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lies' architecture emerges via vellum maps and angled gates, resolved non-literally in final unfolding "truer city" reweighting refusals as underlined payments. Subtext in engineer's quiet admission carries implication over declaration. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in upheaval's calm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in watery diction ("parchment ribbon," "tide lifting") biases toward instinctual clarity; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, compressing under pull ("rope tightened"). Stable single POV; engineer's dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("water does not speak"). Elisions (box contents) taught early, paid in pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "hook found metal... story finally asked to speak" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, openings diverse. Figurative coherent (floods softening deeds), pattern-taught without muddle in peak salvage. Minor paraphrase in reflections ("serenely... serene") but no loop obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of legend-salvage into lie-architecture via guild seals and radio silences transforms trope organically; risk in lyric accumulative voice heightens stakes without gimmick. Final reconfiguration inevitable from early refusals; no derivative templates, bold serene tone commits fully.</comment>
