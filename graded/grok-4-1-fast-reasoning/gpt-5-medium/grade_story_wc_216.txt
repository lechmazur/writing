<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to grasp time's texture drives micro-choices like pocketing the urn fragment and embedding clues, culminating in earned communal rediscovery; Lio applies relational pressure without overshadowing; childhood memory anchors change with felt cost of misplacement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from capsule discovery to patient opening and memory loop-match; orientation anchored early in silo/role; closure as Conceptual Repricing via cricket/posting reconfigures time with acceptance cost of numbers' betrayal legible in "waiting tasted like cedar."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emerald silo's glowing glass and wheat ghosts constrain choices (tracing footprints, placing urn), charging final calendar-planting; sensory filter (smell/touch/shadows) reflects POV urgency; micro-object urn fragment evolves to patch seam, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time texture) signaled early, tightens via Lio/urn match forcing memory confrontation; agency in patience/endurance forecloses numerical return with cost of faithful living; under Accumulative lens, density cadence reweights via rediscovery loop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sensory time vs. betrayed numbers emerges organically through garage clues and footprint-walking; final image of boot/"soft thunder" offers non-literal resonance, reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity of waiting lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing ("pulses by smell," "spoons that weighed yesterdays"); stable first-person POV with compression taught early, legible at closure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing via Lio's smile/question.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length; metaphors coherent/patterned (braiding shadows/clues/paths) without muddle; minor synonym churn ("braided") in non-peak beats, no closure touch; propulsion intact via image-forward lines like "receipts that tasted like rainstorms."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-numbers surrealism into tactile calendar-building transforms trope of lost time; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at communal closure; irreplaceable details like cricket-as-New-Year heighten stakes organically.</comment>
