<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in keeper's ink role and micro-choices like anchoring points; walker's gesture reveals hierarchy of trust in margins over direct sight. Internal endurance earned via ritual friction, but characters lean archetypal with subtle flaws. Prophet's nod compels without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rite to widened clearing; on-page CR in "echo...settle against my ribs" reweights prophecy as endurance with conceptual cost of valley's forgetfulness. Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt. Final image forecloses blare definitively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dunes' parapet constrains tactics (heaves against wind, toes ridgelines); pavilion's glass ribs and hushed consonants charge midday turning point and dusk close. Sensory hierarchy (peripheral glimmers over direct) mirrors POV. Evolves causally from stir to firm to sleep.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echoes) tightens via midday wind reversal, forcing peripheral shift that narrows to trust's trade-off. Agency in walker's gesture and keeper's facing away; cost legible in fatigue and ongoing valley pressure. Single deepening suffices under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of echo endurance emerges via cup/prophet image shift from trumpet misconception; final ribs-settling reconfigures restraint without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures invites ambiguity on sincerity's gravity. Particulars like talon-folding birds recharge organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (breathing boundaries, glimmer leaks); rhythmic compression modulates from murmur to bare voice under wind stress. Stable first-person collective with no leakage; purposeful elision of direct paths pays off in widened clearing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sew calm into the air" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, but hush/whisper recurrences border purposeful pattern without full teaching, docking minor loop. No artifacts dull closure; figurative coherent in peak wind beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual fantasy with peripheral truth as tactic transforms prophecy trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable elements like soot-blackened feet. Inevitable hindsight in tomorrow's repeat from dune-sleep image.</comment>
