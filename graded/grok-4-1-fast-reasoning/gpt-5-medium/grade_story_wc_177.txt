<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied, contradictory emotions (scar itching, ribs yawning); motivation intensifies via dream translations compelling seal break and exit. Final shepherd realization earned through prior ritual causality, foreclosing bunker passivity with felt exposure cost. Minor slip in overt trait labels slightly diluting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (dream margins, eel map steadying) builds to CR closure where name/maze reconfigures to direction via decayed invitation, cost legible in "step into the weather." Orientation anchored in first paragraph (bunker, forest, storm); one tightening via archive verb recovery narrows to door act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (thunder alphabet, silk dust, spongey loam) filtered through POV urgency; bunker/forest constrains via lung-like inhalation, storm pressures exit. Recurring archive constrains choice (feed dreams); final door charges image, mirroring internal path-opening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (path choice discovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via map writhing to steadying, forcing transcendence agency; cost felt in weather acceptance ("wolves are weather"). Protagonist endurance forecloses waiting option on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (decay as invitation) emerges organically from particulars (crumbling wafer, missing verb); final image ("name becomes a direction") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in playful cosmos grin tensions fate illusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (cosmic grins, ethereal grit) with rhythmic modulation under storm pressure; stable first-person focalization biases noticing (lightning reading). Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at door exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload ("eels," "iron-skinned bruise," "nails lullaby") in peak beats borders coherence strain without full payoff. Minor paraphrase loops ("precisely playful" motif); strong propulsion overall, no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of decaying tech-archive as path-invitation transforms bunker trope; risk-taking in name-as-maze premise inevitable in hindsight via wafer failure reveal. Bold lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
