<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses (mend ruins vs. leave to ruin) act in scene via picking tessera and calling men, earning final loosening of past with visible cost in refusing easy guilt. Steel arms embody motivation concretely. Boy and men apply targeted pressure without diluting core drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from boy's naming to men's, culminating in RR/Charged Poise as tessera returns and past loosens with labor's cost legible in "the work begins to move them." Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plaza and tessera constrain choices (whispers patterns, scatters caps) and charge final image. Sensory selectivity (ash halos, shadows on wrists) mirrors warm coldness via POV bias. Shattered sky evolves from sentence to ceiling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy via naming) signaled early; tightening via boy-to-men shift narrows to resisting "easy echo," forcing trade-off with cost in bowed heads and unpaid labor. Agency in kneeling arrangement under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of renaming without erasure emerges via tessera's wound-to-loosening arc; final image reweights mercy's complexity non-literally. Subtext in bottle caps and stone grammar avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind moved like a careful surgeon") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from reflective to tense naming. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (boy's plea pursues goal). Stable first-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; purposeful metaphors taught early cohere lyrically. Minor repetition of "warm coldness" pattern-reinforces tone without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire renamer with mosaic divination transforms redemption trope; risk in poetic steel-empathy voice heightens stakes organically. Tessera return feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
