<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via embodied serene anger ("hands steady, old fire quenched to ember") and contradictory impulses (trust sand over ghosts, prowl "consciously wild"); refusal of throne earned by mentor's recoil and personal question lodged "under my ribs," foreclosing trader path with outline's disappearance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ink density reveals patterns/spine/algorithm, tightening to chamber offer; CR closure in "refuse the throne... ink... taking my outline with it... metronome forgets," reconfiguring time-market premise with personal erasure cost legible in hollow left in air.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory (wind-carved "auric ribs," ink's "laminar tongues," salt-blue hut); dunes/ink constrain tracking/revelation, metronome charges final forgetting as environment mirrors internal refusal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end time-market via "why time slows" question) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ink maps showing "algorithm... wants every heart to lag," narrowing to throne refusal with agency (spill ink, lie as levee) and cost (personal disappearance foreclosing power).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (crisis-time as currency) emerges organically from ink revelations and mentor's "edges are bargains"; ending's ink-erasure and metronome silence offers non-literal reweighting of taming as theft, lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dunes half-remember," ink "tastes," "hummingbird... wingtips combing"); rhythmic modulation (short urgent sentences in refusal: "I refuse... I step through") sustains single POV under pressure, experimental poetic compression taught early via ink patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line advances revelation or image); figurative coherent and pattern-taught (ink "eddies... hiccups," "fractal notes"), but peak chamber beat borders overwrite density slightly dulling propulsion in throne enumeration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of disappearing ink, time-selling metronome, and self-erasure refusal transforms ghost-haunted dunes into algorithm-hunger market; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in "hollow... learns it as a song."</comment>
