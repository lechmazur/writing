<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pyramid scheme survivor backstory roots motivation in IOU scars that "itch most when the moon fogs," driving micro-choices like signing the console; contradictory impulses (fright vs. braver selves) act in scene via thumbs shaking and chamber-turning, earning final endurance with ledger dissolution as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: surreal density builds from texts ("stuttering on my cracked screen in ghost alphabets") to chamber heave and diamond bloom as Charged Poise RR, with cost in "ruined ledger dissolves"; orientation anchors early in farm/night shift; no shards, causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms as micro-setting constrain via pulsing "like patient lanterns counting my fright" and caps lifting to pray, charging final diamond facets; sensory hierarchy (glow, dew slickness, scent of vows/salt) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keep quantum promise vs. predatory leaks) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via text chorus forking choices and chamber filament tightening options; protagonist agency in bolting ("oceans pretend to return") forecloses doubt-path with legible cost in personal scars resolved conceptually.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-as-promise emerges organically from survivor scars to "edible geometry" diamonds reweighting value/trust; final image ("ledger of breath") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing, complexity in mischief-virtue balance lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("air smells like hatching equations") biases surreal noticing consistently; voice modulates rhythm with pressure (short shakes in "thumbs shake" vs. purr resolution); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("it belonged to a window that married an abyss"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm/openings, but figurative overload in peak ("filament... harp string of pure intention") risks coherence without pause (-0.4); no loops/scaffold, strong verbs/images integrate action; closure image ("laugh... valve finding its note") clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of farm quantum crisis and parallel-self texts feels inevitable/non-obvious, transforming pyramid scam trope via bolt ritual; bold lyric risks (backward timestamps, ghost chorus) heighten stakes/cohere to closure without gimmick.</comment>
