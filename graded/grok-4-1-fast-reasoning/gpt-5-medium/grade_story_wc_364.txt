<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iven's meekness and determination shine in climax trading memories ("mouth form the names of his parents"), earning endurance with embodied cost (bruised wrist). Traits constrain choices without labels; collective "we" limits deeper contradictions but actions reveal hierarchy of values. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices like knotting silk show quiet intent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds over three nights to pattern break in storm, yielding RR closure as arches settle and rubble sighs, with cost in "wrist bruised" and traded memories. Orientation anchored early (orchard planet, quakes, Iven). One tightening suffices; no causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain climax ("groaned like waking giants," settle handspan), orchards root into terraces, charging final image. Sensory selective (azure sky, silk glows, stone hums); POV-biased to mystery. Micro-setting (mines as "arteries," silk) shapes tactics without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience from rubble) signaled early; escalation via nights' density to third-night storm forces trade-off (memories for steadiness). Agency in deliberate bartering narrows options; cost legible in personal forfeiture, charging poise. Coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of deliberate promises emerges from silk tightening on oaths, reweighted in bells "rang in a key of azure defiance." No moralizing; resonance from particulars (roots weaving ladders). Final image answers "reason to stand" non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-plural POV stable, collective interior biased to "live beside mystery." Voice rhythmic, perceptual signature in poetic compression ("hammering more hope than iron"); modulates with pressure (short sentences in storm). No head-hopping; elision taught early, pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (long poetic builds to "silk snapped bright"); density high without loops. Figurative heavy in climax ("wind grew spare, as though out of arguments") borders overwriting but pattern-taught as lyric texture, no muddle at closure. Concise propulsion; minor synonym echoes (lifted walls/us).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bartering awakenings via silk/mines on floating-arch planet transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; bells grazing ladders inevitable from particulars. No derivatives; azure defiance inflects uniquely.</comment>
