<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lore keeper's "old ache of libraries" embodies motivation to remember over rule, compelling climax oath; Quin's doubt pressures duet choice, earning relational reconfiguration with cost of crown refusal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via layered discoveries (shard splits broadcast, paint peel reveals murals, stair inverts), landing RR closure in throne's duet compromise with unbound cost legible in "chair stayed nobly empty."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wired orchard pears and kaleidoscopic waterfall constrain path (prismatic spray corridor, root seam hatch), charging final "orchard breathed easier" image to mirror ascent theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunrise deadline and throne stakes tighten accumulatively through puzzle escalations, forcing agency in oath/renunciation; cost unmistakable in shared pulse foreclosing solo rule.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of deferred choices emerges organically via murals of "choices deferred with care," answered non-literally in final apples' "unrealized futures turning into seeds" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Consistent first-person perceptual signature ("stubborn ghosts of machines," "apples pinged softly") biases toward ruins; rhythmic modulation peaks in descent, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "broadcast than a cascade") propels under textural lens; minor thickening in orchard flourishes but no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Downward "stairway of ascension" inverts quest trope organically, synthesizing algorithm monarch and wired fruit into fresh duet governance; risk heightens relational stakes inventively.</comment>
