<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in grafting father's wind-reading skill onto compassion, earning her final endurance as "opposite of a fuse"; micro-choices like sprinkling sand reveal hierarchy of values with scar-cost. Boy interaction forces relational crucible without scolding. Interiority concrete and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: pinning coin and resting sand reconfigures her as compassion's engine, cost legible in "scars that crackle" grafted beyond smoke. Orientation anchored early in dunes-to-lagoon walk; two shards transition cleanly via return to station.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand constrain choices (coin-touch ripples, sprinkle crescent) and charge final image via water's song mirroring scars; sensory hierarchy (salt-cooled lava, kelp peace) filters through her firefighter bias. Spatial choreography coherent from dunes edge to graft stump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove scars sing via lagoon) tightens texturally when boy arrives, forcing endurance-teaching with graft trade-off; agency in ritual choices narrows to relational cost, charging poise without resolution. Pressure coheres under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grafting calm onto fire emerges organically via sand-on-water chime and tree graft, final image ("tide worked steadily") reweights premise with non-literal resonance on scars' song. No moralizing; ambiguity in forgiveness lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fire-water synesthesia ("char that had learned to float") and rhythmic modulation under ritual pressure; stable close-third POV with lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "sea opening its lungs") coherent across peak lagoon beat, no loops or muddle; varied rhythm propels from walk to graft. Opening anchors stakes poetically, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson legacy into lagoon ritual and graft heals tropes organically; risk-taking in sustained lyric voice heightens stakes via scar-song premise, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
