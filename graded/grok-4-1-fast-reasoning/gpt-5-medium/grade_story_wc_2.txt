<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory pursuit of exactness versus irregular beat culminates in earned water clock assembly, with micro-choices like timing the waterfall crossing revealing values under pressure; journal realization pivots interiority concretely.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as compass-guided discoveries densify to Conceptual Repricing in "clock of water" image; cost legible in foreclosed rigid planning, with cascade rhythm tightening pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall's "roar hammering its basin" and spray rhythm constrain crossing choice, while walls "polished like watch faces" charge final assembly; sensory hierarchy fits tinkerer POV perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of befriending uncertainty escalates texturally through deepening realizations (journal, key), agency in improvising clock; cost unmistakable in "plans emerge, they will be written in flow."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of irregular fidelity emerges implicitly via particulars like compass constellations and water gears; final "harbor where improvisations could anchor" reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct tinkerer voice ("time flinches when touched") biases perception toward mechanisms, modulating rhythm under stress; stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in peak beats like "droplet struck a spoon, each spoon nudged a gear"; minor figurative density in mist descriptions purposeful, no loops obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer mythos with admiral's stone currents transforms loss into water clock epiphany; bold lyric risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
