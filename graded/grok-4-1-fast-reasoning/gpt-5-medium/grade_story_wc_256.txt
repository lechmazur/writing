<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism-song bell ringer's motivation to discover connection's texture drives concrete micro-choices like polishing the lens and ringing the ferry bell, embodied in hands "powerfully gentle." Interiority particular via sensory ties to sounds and grief, with volunteer's whisper catalyzing shared change. Minor abstraction in epiphanic "braid" risks unearned feel, but prior textural buildup earns it without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sounds/stations builds to Charged Poise in final crystal bell ring and "braid" reconfiguration, with felt cost in lingering moonlight on palms foreclosing isolation. Orientation anchors early in lab post-grid stabilization. Single scene with reflective shards complies; pattern taught immediately pays off cleanly at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lab of lost sounds vividly tactile—jars of vanished bells, damp lens smell—constrains choices via prismatic bending of notes into "braided threads." Carbide lens as micro-setting charges final image, spilling streets into light. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (echoes over visuals); golden shadows evolve purposefully without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—textural connection via pilgrimage—tightens texturally through stations, peaking in volunteer’s grief processed by ferry bell’s "shallow sandbar," narrowing to personal crystal bell with felt cost in "citrus from someone chewing fear." Agency in ringing/listening drives escalation; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection as "braid" emerges implicitly from bell spectra, volunteer tide-shift, and final streets woven in light, reweighting grief/silence without statement. Subtext in silences and "questions propel listening" invites ambiguity on ownership of sound. Final image offers non-literal answer, charging prior motifs organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice distinct in perceptual signature—noticing "rainbow seam," "moist crumb of confession"—with rhythmic modulation from setup to charged end. Stable POV, no leakage; volunteer's whisper natural/subtextual. Syntax reflects gentle intensity, purposeful compression taught early legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion via dense multi-job lines like "polish it until it gives the room a patient moon." Figurative density ("braided threads," shadows) patterned, not overwriting in peak volunteer beat. Minor paraphrase in "powerfully gentle" repeats motivated by voice; no loops obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-blackout sound-lab pilgrimage transforms tropes of grief/healing into prismatic "texture of connection," with lab's lost bells enabling non-obvious braid metaphor. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, fully committed premise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
