<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, as in "breathing matched the fans" embodying alignment; motivation rooted in "love cracked me open" drives micro-choices like kneeling to alarms. Earned change to transparency forecloses hiding with vulnerability cost at "afraid and grateful and ready." Minor diagnostic epiphany phrasing at closure slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from maintenance rituals to power failure's ghost-stepping-nearer, culminating in Charged Poise RR as meteors respect boundary after roof-opening. Orientation anchored early in station/janitor role. Closure cost legible in "spared collision" reconfiguring solitude into full stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy via POV: "floor smelled like copper and old tea," "galaxy smelled like distance"; yellow lantern glass constrains by lighting powerless consoles and charges final image as "small sun." Setting guides choices like polishing switches, mirroring internal transparency without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vulnerability-strength signaled early via hiding post-love; textural escalation in meteor burst/power fail deepens to map-boundary tightening, forcing stance crystallization in roof-opening/speaking. Agency in attention/renunciation forecloses collision path with felt exposure cost. Minor abstraction in stakes legibility pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of polishing marks into guidance emerges organically from station whispers/memories, reweighted in final "purpose... not to erase marks, but to polish them." Resonant non-literal closure image answers vulnerability question via "spared collision." Complexity lingers in ghost-kin shift without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing like "streaks across the dome, swift signatures of rocks"; rhythmic control modulates from meditative to charged in power fail ("honeyed light draped the gauges"). Stable first-person lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "Each dawn, I polished... fossil pollen"; rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion fits scene breathing. Minor figurative density in power fail ("unbending its ribs," "coils shiver like a throat") risks muddle but voice-consistent; no loops or scaffolds touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor-empathy with station-as-alive via meteor-tracing method transforms trope of overlooked maintenance into primal cosmic attunement. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes of solitude; "map of nothing I had ever chased" turn inevitable from notebook particulars.</comment>
