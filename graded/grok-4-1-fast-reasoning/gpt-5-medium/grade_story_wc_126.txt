<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and acoustic-specific, with motivation to unbind silence intensifying through Lark's questions into communal tending; micro-choices like explaining "songs that never finish" reveal hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses in adapting mother's fire tradition to lantern circle show embodied endurance. Secondary characters apply light but coherent pressure without diluting focalizer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush, notes, bowl items builds to Charged Poise closure in "bowl grows heavy with gentle obligations" and parting decision, reconfiguring silence as patient company with felt cost of ongoing unfinished tending. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse/shipwrecks. One tightening via stories-to-action shift narrows to map-like purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (brackish light, keel timbers loosening, orchard breathing) selectively bias toward acoustic POV, constraining play within glass/shipwreck hedges; final "footprints on the greenhouse steps" charges closure image. Micro-setting of bowl-as-map evolves tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind chronic hush for unfinished beauty) signaled early, escalates texturally via girl’s questions, bowl-filling, and collective decision that forecloses tidy endings with cost of "gentle obligations." Agency in play/response crystallizes stance; Lark exchange deepens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished beauty emerges organically from particulars like "songs that never finish" and half-tended objects, resonant in final image of footprints as enduring song without moralizing. Subtext in shell/marble exchange lingers ambiguity of release vs. endurance. Protagonist arc inextricable from hush-loosening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in acoustic biases ("tremble that refuses to finish," clinks as map); rhythmic control modulates from hush to loosening braid. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Lark's queries pursue wonder), advances without exposition. Stable first-person, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bow nods like a patient bird" advances rhythm/emotion); varied syntax propels without loops, though minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrite. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene; closure image clear/crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh post-burn synthesis of acoustic renewal in sunken orchard transforms climate tropes via violinist’s unbinding; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes of patient hush. Final "pockets full of beginnings" inevitable from bowl-map buildup, no hedging.</comment>
