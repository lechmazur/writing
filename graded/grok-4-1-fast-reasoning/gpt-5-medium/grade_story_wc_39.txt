<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation as translator roots choices like jarring the music box notes, earning the closure realization of their "true trade" with visible cost in promising to yield the role. Interiority concrete and poetic, embodied in sensory specifics like "saltwood and rope." Final micro-choice to open windows reveals hierarchy of values, confronting flaw of isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from box's rust to jarred notes conversing with weather-voices, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) where melody bridges grief, reconfiguring village spaces "between them grew fewer" with emotional cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in loft/dunes. One tightening via notes "trickle[ing] from the box" narrows to communal redemption; cost legible in widow's embrace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like "jarred echoes," "salt and sawdust" filter through poet's bias, constraining choices (jars catch weather, box on sill). Loft/dunes charge final image as husband's build revealed, purring post-event. Micro-setting (jars, box) evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating generations via sounds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as box notes deepen jarred voices, forcing village stance crystallization with widow's grief as felt cost. Agency in inviting barefoot crowd, opening jars narrows solo trade. Moral calculus in grief-to-conversation trade-off charges peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sound-bridging emerges from particulars like "gull bargains" conversing with melody, reweighting premise in final "long breath that lets a note cross a threshold" without statement. Resonance from irony of widow fearing her own harmony; ambiguity lingers in narrator's yielding promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measured meals by syllables," "voices of passing weather") biases noticing toward sonic/textural, stable first-person with rhythmic compression under dawn pressure. Voice modulates from lonesome to communal without drift; elision of box origins taught early, paid in reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines like "light trembled as if reading a diary" advance image/atmosphere without loops. Rhythms vary (short notes trickle, long loft purrs); metaphors coherent (ballerina as "hinge between rooms"). No scaffolds, propulsion peaks in village beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jarred sounds/music box transforms vagrant trope into sonic redemption, with husband's hidden song as inevitable turn from particulars. Bold lyric risks heighten stakes (dunes "learn to listen"); no derivative echoes, voice commits fully.</comment>
