<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (freeze amid work) culminate in earned change: steady hands folding the photo. Somatic markers reveal character-particular coping without diagnostic labels. Micro-choices under pressure (gull rescue) expose values hierarchy with visible cost. Final renunciation of erasure for addition feels compelled by prior trauma layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory patterns (vent whir, helicopter drone) deepen stake toward Charged Poise closure in final photo fold and sleep with "work ready to meet him." One tightening (gull incident) reconfigures coping options. Cost legible in "wound that had decided to scar." Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (salt/sap wind, fog on panes, leaves sweating) filters through Rafi's priorities, constraining choices like cliff-path gull rescue. Recurring lighthouse blink charges final image as unmanned blessing. Micro-setting (caretaker's room hum) mirrors internal stasis. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (optimism in realism amid PTSD) signaled early, texturally escalates via drone triggers to pearl of stillness post-gull, narrowing to exhibit-sharing exposure. Agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses denial path. Cost felt in "ribs in wire" and photo's crowded edges. One deepening sufficient, charges poise without resolution coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of care-as-healing emerges organically from grafts, gull, logbooks; final image ("steady as a trellis in wind") offers non-literal resonance to "rooms that storms could enter." Subtext in silences (photo not often taken out) avoids moralizing. Particulars (somatic naming, tide patience) yield complexity without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (tides, grafts as metaphors); rhythm modulates from freeze stutter to steady propulsion. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (niece: "about the citrus"). No head-hopping; diction character-bound, avoiding filter stacks. Voice coheres as trauma-tempered lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "skein of air snarling into rotors" advances sensation/plot). Varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (snail shadows, pearl); no loops or scaffolds. Propulsion matches beats, zero artifacts in closure ("paper new only in the way his hands now held it"). Ear-test clean.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: PTSD via arboretum somatic gardening transforms tropes; lighthouse logs paired with plants ingeniously reweights weather-as-choice. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmick. Particular details (madrona trimming, seeds taking wind as partner) feel inevitable, not templated.</comment>
