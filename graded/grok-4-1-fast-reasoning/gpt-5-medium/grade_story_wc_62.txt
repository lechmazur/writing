<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority via chisel taps mirroring tides and ribbon loosening meditative grip; contradictory impulses surface in mother's hush curbing ornament, earning father's shared breath without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught time elision across migration; CR closure in "single spare curve" reconfigures grief as unfinished quilt with legible endurance cost; orientation anchored early in greenhouse setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains via drafts/butterflies steering syllables and charges final kite curve; sensory hierarchy (soil's glow, fern shadows) filters through carver's priorities, evolving causally with storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping grief tightens accumulatively via father's notch choice and migration cadence shift narrowing to spare curve; agency in shallow-then-deeper cuts bears visible pacing cost, though low antagonism limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grief-as-migrating-rings emerges organically from ribbon poems and butterfly commas reweighting mother's lessons; final kite image offers resonant non-literal answer to collective endurance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tide/roots/loom metaphors reflects meditative bias; stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically with intensity, no leakage; brief dialogue natural/subtextual in poem trade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but dense figurative layering (glass ribs/tide, hush/gust) risks coherence strain in sustained beats; no loops, clean mechanics, rhythm excels read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carving-as-mapping grief via poems/butterflies transforms tropes; risk in lyric time-stretch heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via ribbon's evolving pauses.</comment>
