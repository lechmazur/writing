<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentinel’s gentle persuasion and traveler’s contradictory love/rivers impulse act in the dialogue and tool-handing climax, earning her map-rewriting choice with relational cost. Distinct voices: sentinel’s vine-inflected wisdom vs. traveler’s murmured doubt. Minor slip in overt "intersubjective understanding" label, but doesn’t touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (vines, letter, map) builds to Charged Poise closure in folded map/scar and dawn departure, reweighting mismatch with remembered cost (“scar folded into a future”). Orientation anchored in first lines; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion lantern constrains writing/kneeling choice and charges moths/light image mirroring fatal trust. Vines as recurring micro-setting evolve with wind, mirroring internal states. Sensory hierarchy (apple skins, creaks) POV-specific to sentinel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover relational arrival) signaled early, deepens via letter-map reveal and graft parallels, forcing her tool-use/renunciation with bridge-patience cost. Agency in writing forecloses pure paths; lens-consistent tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nurturable mismatches emerges via graft parallels and map-carving, resonant in final “scar folded into a future” without moralizing. Subtext in silences (cannot apologize for rivers) invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (vines as “listening elders”) and rhythmic modulation (short persuasive lines amid lyric swells) stable in first-person. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (e.g., “Do you love him” probes without snapping twigs).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., creaks “as if remembering” propels); metaphors consistent (scorch/horizon, grafts). No loops or scaffolds; purposeful overwriting taught early as voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sentinel grafts viticulture onto heartbreak via burned edge/map, transforming mentor trope with irreplaceable pavilion specificity; risks lyric subtlety heightening closure charge.</comment>
