<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (save lighthouse vs. self's dimming eye) act in threading shelves and descent; final wick-lighting choice earned by prior micro-choices with cost of seeing failed faces. Interiority concrete via "luminescent ache" embodiment. No unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of thread-images builds to RR closure in wick-flame and widened walls, reconfiguring inner lens with cost of confronted faces ("cards lifted... trembled"). Orientation anchored early in lighthouse library. One tightening via keeper's log insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brine-sweating stones and rust-ticking gearhouse constrain wick repair and charge final spiral light. Sensory hierarchy (oil/linen smells narrowing to sulfur match) reflects urgency. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (re-aim inner lens via darkness) signaled early, tightens via thread-braiding agency under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "light argued up the spiral" forcing face-confrontation. One deepening forecloses dimming path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of untangling faces/lives emerges implicitly from card-threading to ledger entry; final "column of brightness that stitched her to the weather" reweights fragments non-literally. No moralizing, complexity in ambiguous grief-correction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tide-wrack similes and rhythmic modulation (short stubborn flame sentences). Voice as character: syntax fragments like "light argued up the spiral" under pressure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (threads/light) paying off at closure; no loops or scaffolds, rhythm varies (gull commas to fluent flame). Minor overwrite risk in metaphors, but coherent and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Threaded-tarot-to-wick redesign synthesizes portraiture/lightkeeping freshly; risks lyric density heighten stakes, transforming abandonment trope via "I will keep the faces." Inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
