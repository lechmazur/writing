<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's rational traits shine in precise actions like smearing the eye with mud, contrasting involuntary truth that coils "up my esophagus" during patrol tension; contradictory impulses (evidence vs. rumor) drive micro-choices; earned endurance at closure via commitment to forage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from foraging to patrol intrusion to group ritual, delivering Charged Poise closure in final commitment where eye "grows warm" reconfigures fractures with endurance cost; anchors clear by paragraph 2; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains choices (swaying sways patrol retreat, mud hides eye) and charges final image ("orchard steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured"); sensory details (creaking like chandelier, ropes of rain) filter through forager's veined perceptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychological safety via eye) tightens accumulatively through patrol pressure forcing occlusion tactics, converging on group's confession beat; agency in truthful invitation forecloses handover risk with visible endurance cost in proceeding ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fractured grace emerges organically from eye-holding ritual and girl's confession, reweighting premise in final line's resonant endurance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "warm from all we allow it to hold."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scent over rumor, rational amid metaphors) sustains first-person stability; voice modulates rhythmically from calm foraging to tense patrol without slippage; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency (short patrol sentences vs. flowing reflections); high density packs image/action (e.g., "lamps stuttering through sheets of rain"); metaphors consistent and voice-bound, no loops or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-virus world, relic eye, and forager therapy transforms tropes into inevitable fractured grace; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
