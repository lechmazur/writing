<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to transform bitterness drives micro-choices like planting the arrowhead, with embodied ache and laughter as cover revealing contradiction; final keeper acceptance feels earned via prior anomalies. Herbalist applies late pressure without muddying POV. Minor slip in overt mission statement slightly abstracts internal conflict before descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly density (doors jamming, returning altered) tightens to drain descent as Resonant Reconfiguration, with legible cost in remaking names/postures. Orientation anchors early (janitor in garden after hours). Patterned elisions (phone leads) pay off at closure without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden's breathing floor, Braille roots, swinging bulbs constrain choices (e.g., arrowhead to drain) and charge final image of slowed arcs and stair. Sensory hierarchy (gravitational drafts, peppermint black) reflects researcher bias, integrated via cleaning actions. No white-room; evolves causally to vertebrae stair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover/engage anomaly, turn bitterness to joke) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via phone confessions to descent, narrowing to keeper stance. Agency in singing/placing arrowhead forecloses outsider path with remaking cost. Climax harmony pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness-metamorphosed-via-laughter emerges from particulars (seedlings standing, names in root); final image reweights ache as held hope without moralizing. Subtext in iron smiles, cosmic joke resonates organically. No tidy binary; ambiguity lingers in being kept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice (e.g., "soil had edited their spines") with perceptual bias (anomalies in ache/bones) stable in first-person; modulates rhythmically under pressure (tin throat singing). Herbalist dialogue sparse, subtextual ("keepers sometimes must be kept"), distinct idiom. No head-hopping; elisions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm suits lyric mode; metaphors consistent (whale-breathing garden) without muddle in peak descent. Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., inhaling/exhaling floor/seeds) and repetitive "cosmic joke" phrasing drag momentum slightly pre-climax. Propulsion clear to charged ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid garden as bitterness archive, arrowhead-tooth seeding harmony; risk-taking in textured lyricism heightens stakes (e.g., singing hiss transforms drain). No template echoes; premise implications (remade returnees) followed boldly to cosmic punchline closure.</comment>
