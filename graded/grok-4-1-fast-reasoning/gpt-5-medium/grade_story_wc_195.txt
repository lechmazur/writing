<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (battle-trained yet soft steps) act vividly in scene; final kernel choice earned by mother's program cue and prior micro-choices like unsnapping gorget, with cost of releasing other shapes legible. Interiority concrete and embodied (cold night on face, shivering bliss). No stock phrasing; flaws (withdrawn from wars) complicate allegiance shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns builds to Charged Poise closure when kernel pressed to tongue, reconfiguring allegiance with conceptual cost ("choose one shape and release the others"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one continuous scene with tightening climb to kernel. No causality breaks; cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting (orchard trees shifting to steps, mercury sap) constrains choices (follow program path) and charges final reel of mornings; recurring glass roof evolves from trembling constellations to nectar-dripping frames. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (knight notices alchemical grafts over battle echoes). No white-room; micro-objects like ladder integrate tactically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture possibility) signaled early, tightens via ladder climb and kernel choice under Accumulative lens, narrowing to trade-off with felt cost in release of other shapes. Agency in micro-choices (visor/gorget unsnaps) forces deepening; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution. Minor abstractness in possibilities but charges closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of murmured allegiance over thunder emerges organically from program/mother particulars, reweighted in final homecoming image without moralizing. Subtext in shifting trees/patterns invites ambiguity (treasonous geometry); resonant non-literal answer to war-vs-tending question. No tidy binaries; complexity in knight's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (reality shifts as breath-measured); rhythmic prose modulates from soft entry to shivering peak without head-hopping. Voice texture (sap scores, bee staircases) character-specific to withdrawn knight. No elision withholding; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors consistent in orchard voice, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short clicks to long reels). Minor overwrite in peak ("apple stars, quince comets") borders coherence but pattern-taught and closure-clean. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges patterns without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knight in factually mystical orchard via mother's marionette program transforms tropes organically; risk in poetic geography (equations in bark) heightens stakes to conceptual treason. Inevitable hindsight: kernel choice grows from forgotten patterns without late rules. Bold lyric structure coherent under lens.</comment>
