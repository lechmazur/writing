<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in "heartbeat falters like a deer on unfamiliar ice," revealing contradiction between systematic care and emotional vulnerability; past failure with "rain-dial" anchors motivation without flattening pressure; final self-naming choice earned with visible cost in relief's "salt and dust."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wind's whisper to chime repair, tightening in sewing beat; on-page Charged Poise closure in "bamboo tube answers with the faintest grace note," reconfiguring memory's stakes with conceptual cost of stewardship; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "gallery of weathered acoustics" guiding lantern; recurring balloons and balcony charge final image of release; selective sensory details like "foxglove regret" perfume mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve name signaled early, escalates texturally in "crack answers by the echo" deepening pressure; agency in song-guided sewing forecloses loss with heartbeat falter as felt cost; closure image of ringing chime crystallizes trade-off under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory stewardship emerges implicitly from repair particulars, reweighted in final "name travels down" without moralizing; foxglove regret motif shifts from perfume to earned relief, offering non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in echo/catalog mappings and rhythmic lyric compression; POV stable first-person with biased noticing of resonances; voice modulates intensity without drift, peaking in sewing's breath-sync.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "I sew where the song guides me, never piercing the tone"; varied rhythm passes read-aloud; purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-memory-organism with sound-stitching transforms trope of caretaker; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via chime's healing gravity.</comment>
