<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (joy/grief balance) act in scene via embodied weight shifts; final calibrated gladness earns door opening with cost of unclenching fists. Pacifist traits compel non-wrenching lean, revealed in "pressing with the forgiving weight the stone had taught me."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds to Charged Poise closure where door opens via balanced buoyancy, cost legible in "caught a rail... laughter was ballast, not escape." Orientation anchored early in ship/caretaker setup; one tightening via shadow integration suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ship's recycled hulls, greenhouse spinach, albums constrain choices (anchoring to comet, tear in palm); recurring albums charge final "gathered the albums and whispered thanks," mirroring internal states through salt veins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension via emotional balance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through shadow work to agency-driven telling of stories, foreclosing wrenching with cost of "fists unclench." Escalation coherent under lens, cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of compassion shadowed by grief emerges via particulars (orchard boy, village names); resonant non-literal close in "hands will be both gentle and strong" reweights premise without moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (grief's salt maps, weight as judge); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure, prose as character reflects ghostly mind without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; figurative pattern taught early coheres in lyric mode without muddle, but minor metaphor density in peak ("pulsed like minnows... blueprint") risks slight overwriting. No loops, propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional physics, tear relic, tear-map navigation transforms pacifist sci-fi into inevitable shadow-balance premise; risk-taking in physics rule heightens stakes, no derivative echoes.</comment>
