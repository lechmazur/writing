<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied tapping habit revealing fear and measurement under pressure; motivation from ruined reef drives consistent micro-choices to communal action. Final endurance of impermanence earned via prior struggle with maps vs. living geometry. Contradictory impulses (solitary witness to assembler) act in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of taps, ribbons, and logs build to CR closure in final image of page living alone, reweighting assembly with cost of movement. Orientation anchored by station and paths in first paragraph. Revelation beat ("delayed revelation tugged") pays off disorientation functionally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station console and tidal flats constrain choices, with taps on metal enabling station response and path prediction. Ribbon and shiver-sand charge final lantern/dream image. Sensory hierarchy (rhythmic hums over visuals) reflects diver POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vanishing paths) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via rhythm decoding that narrows options from useless maps to temporary corridor. Cost legible in "nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move," charging poise. Agency in radioing village forecloses solitary path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rhythmic endurance in drift emerges organically from taps-to-corridor arc; final image non-literally answers impermanence without moralizing. Recurring "drifting moored" recharges particulars. Resonance from reef-breathing struggle avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic syntax and biased noticing (swells, beats over statics); voice modulates from puzzle to charged poise. Stable first-person with purposeful compression taught via taps. No head-hopping, inference matches diver lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic propulsion mirroring taps; figurative layer (kelp revelation, vertebrae lanterns) purposeful without muddle in peak beats. Minor density in ribbon metaphors (-0.1), but pattern-taught. No loops, clean syntax variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coral rhythms birthing paths via station taps transforms eco-trope into living geometry. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in corridor shine. Final page-as-shore image inevitable from particulars.</comment>
