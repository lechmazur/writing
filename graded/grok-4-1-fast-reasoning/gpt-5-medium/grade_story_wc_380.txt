<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied grief like sister's laugh "beginning in her shoulder"; micro-choices from lamp-lighting to exhuming compel higher stakes with earned recovery. Contradictory duty vs. memory hunt acts in scene, culminating in sealing the memory with felt restoration cost. Flawless single-POV coherence elevates to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from lantern boundary to corridor recovery, holding to Charged Poise closure in "gleaming silence between the click and the flame" with conceptual cost of fluctuating time/gravity. Orientation anchors immediately in "dock-side lantern lighter" post-beaching; shards transition legibly via lantern motif. One tightening via memory sheet suffices, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt chamber "glitter with slow frost" and whale ribcage constrain exhumation choice; recurring tin wildflowers charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (pull on bones, salt-paper scent) reflects POV urgency without catalog. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal flux.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover sister's memory) signaled early, deepens via coffee spiral revelation forcing whale visit; agency in pressing glass opens gravity pocket with on-page cost ("ground lifts my heel, then eats my step"). Accumulative pressure reweights to path-keeping realization. No abstract stakes; costs alter tactics visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as navigable path amid change emerges from gravity pockets and salt archives, resonating in final lantern-light image reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like misnamed star avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "world cannot decide which direction time is burning."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("dark keeps stepping over, curious, barefoot"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, stable first-person without leakage. Brief chemist dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing voices cleanly. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "pockets of gravity bump across the pier"; rhythmic variety passes read-aloud, purposeful metaphors (gravity as "tide with private instructions") cohere without muddle. Zero loops, scaffold, or overwriting in peak exhumation/corridor beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of whale-gravity-memory feels inevitable from particulars, transforming beaching trope into "gravity seed bursting the page." Bold lyric risks heighten stakes; no derivative echoes, fresh voice commits fully to premise.</comment>
