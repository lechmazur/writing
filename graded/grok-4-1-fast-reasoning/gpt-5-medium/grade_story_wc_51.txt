<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to weigh burdens rooted in vow and intensifies through embodied actions like trembling hand; internal conflict peaks convincingly when lifting own fear, earning renunciation with cost. Fractal weaver applies precise pressure via gestures and shared orientation. Contradictory impulses act in final burden scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of weighed burdens builds to own fear as decisive tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure where fear shelves without gnawing—cost legible in "balanced against the tide." Single scene coheres with early orientation (grotto under starlight by ~50 words). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of proper orientation shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze grotto walls and lamp halo constrain choices by enabling glow-path for weighing; recurring lamp charges final image as it gutters, satisfying 9+ test. Sensory details (echoes clicking like coins, drips threading) filter through narrator's expectant breath, mirroring internal thaw. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance to dawn exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weigh griefs properly) signaled in vow, escalates accumulatively via failed solo lift of soldier name to shared orientation, deepening to own burden under lens—agency in pulsing north forecloses calcification path. Cost unmistakable in shifted weights altering posture. Protagonist endurance crystallizes stance with on-page trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of honoring burdens' true rests emerges organically from particulars like widow memory warming; final image of ledger in thawing streets reweights "translation of gravity" non-literally, satisfying 9+ test. Resonance from shifting shingled hush into song avoids moralizing. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (e.g., "coins discussing afterlife of pockets") biases toward fractal patterns, stable across intensity; rhythmic modulation heightens in dawn shift to birdsong. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("What I sought... would calcify"), advances goal. No head-hopping; elision of city details paid off in exit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax (e.g., "ribs lit by a kerosene lamp burner I carried in my saltshaken hand"); metaphors cohere fractally without muddle in peak own-burden beat. Minor paraphrase loops in hush/reverie motifs (−0.4); no template cadence or filter stacks dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal weaving burdens transforms grief tropes into tactile grammar; risk of sustained lyric mode heightens stakes via irreplaceable images like "ledger of bone." Final reconfiguration (hush to song) inevitable from particulars. Bold voice commits without hedging.</comment>
