<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to defy hopelessness roots in consistent traits like chanting and ambient awareness, compelling higher-stakes pact with Lark; interiority concrete via sensory filtering. Lark applies relevant pressure as last fire spinner. Final endurance of patient play earns closure with felt cost in "filtering fear from the crowd."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to discovery, prep, climax; mosaic note anchors orientation early, no penalty. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands on-page with cost in "gravity loosen, not vanquished, but persuaded." One tightening via pact suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blooming fortress with moonflowers, mosaic, vines constrain choices (east wall cubby, western mortar placement) and charge final image of walls blossoming. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (fireworks designer notes blooms as fuel, echoes). Setting evolves causally with fireworks ash.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tool discovery, pact, prep under no-stars hush; agency in filtering/mixing narrows options with patient cost. Climax tightens as bursts trace mosaic, forcing crowd's stance crystallization. Cost legible in "patient shape" reprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of serious playfulness vs. gravity emerges organically from fireworks prayer, reweighted in final "petals can sing" without moralizing. Returning images (note, knot, blooms) shift meaning at closure. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chanting, filtering, ambient noticing; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity. Single POV stable, no head-hopping. Minimal dialogue natural, subtextual ("I am Lark, the last fire spinner").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, high density with purposeful lyric figures (e.g., "flame walked the cord, polite as a messenger"); no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in prep beats taught early as pattern, propels to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks as musical defiance in poetic fortress; tropes like hidden tools transformed via mosaic note and rag knot. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes coherently, inevitable in hindsight via "play was our prayer."</comment>
