<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied actions like pressing page against ice and muttering addresses; motivation to collect textures compels endurance with felt isolation cost. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("I am not lying to them; I am giving them a workable grammar for waiting") borders therapy-speak but anchors present choice without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early charting of lamp hum to closure's Charged Poise in "patience answers patience"; orientation anchored by ~50 words (stationer climbing to bonsai labyrinth post-evacuation). Final image of flipping switch and steady hand reconfigures silence with undeniable endurance cost, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bonsai needles and basin constrain writing via light refraction and tree "demands," charging final touching of trees; perceptual bias to textures (roots braided, dawn as diluted ink) selective and POV-specific. Recurrent lamp halo evolves from halo to frozen squares to withdrawn hum, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of inventing histories for silent town accumulates density via lamp modulation, freezing basin, and weakening hum, tightening to endurance under Textural lens. Basin freeze forces micro-adaptation (gilding ice), foreclosing unchecked progression with small winds cost; subtle but legible, enters 8+ via trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of invented histories as "workable grammar for waiting" emerges organically from tree stories and folded invoices sliding into town; final "pages will be only paper, and the bonsai will keep the rest" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of tempered light. No moralizing, ambiguity in town’s breath lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature biases to paper/ink textures ("gilded-leaf," "nibs clean") with rhythmic control modulating from studious catalog to charged poise; POV stable first-person, no elision. Syntax reflects mind ("numbers are a courtesy to uncertainty") under restraint, zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light loosens into ribbons, and the bonsai needles twitch"); rhythm varies read-aloud without monotony. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during measurements ("tone swims; tremor, pulse, sly modulation") risks density dip but pattern-taught as discipline, no closure harm or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stationer crafting bonsai histories amid silence transforms isolation trope via textural archive; risk-taking in lyric mountaintop frame heightens stakes organically. Final duet of hums inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
