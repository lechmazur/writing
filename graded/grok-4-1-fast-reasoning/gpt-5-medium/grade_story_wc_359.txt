<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetically embodied interiority and doubt falter ("Sometimes the bell ringer faltered, remembering the city") reveal contradictory impulses acting in scene; final endurance of motive earns closure choice with visible cost of city renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise RR at "the hush remained unfettered, not vanishing but living as common air"; orientation anchored early, persistent constraint of aurora/ice shapes tactics, cost legible in recalibrated world hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora constrain choices (bell on "column of blue ice," light as "metronome"); recurring frost-flowers evolve with action, charging final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unfettering hush signaled early tightens via falter deepening and sequence escalation under Accumulative lens; agency in strikes forecloses doubt-path with on-page cost of intent's warmth melting frost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-as-essential emerges organically from particulars like amber sheet trust overcoming city noise; final CR image ("standard by which noise could be measured") resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with synesthetic perceptual signature ("hearing blue as a hush, tasting violet as iron"); rhythmic modulation under pressure teaches pattern, no head-hopping, elision pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm serve lyric mode; figurative pattern taught early avoids muddle, but minor synonym churn in hush descriptors ("shape waiting for breath, negative of a statue") slightly dulls peak without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, bell-ringing, and hush-sculpture transforms quiet-creation trope; risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens stakes through aurora constraint, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
