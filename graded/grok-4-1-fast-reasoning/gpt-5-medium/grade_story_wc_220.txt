<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority shines in particular sensory catalogs like "catalog a cloud by smell," embodied in micro-choices under distance's pressure; Harbor's actions (nosing cylinder) reveal character-specific competence. Final endurance of parted ways earns closure with felt relational cost. Contradictory impulses in trying leaf as compass act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (cylinders to relay) tightens toward Charged Poise/CR at dusk signal, where sun "snapped shut" makes before/after legible with conceptual cost of resuming quiet. Orientation anchored early in Sluice. Lens taught by midpoint, closure cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scrapyard details like "rib cages of buses" constrain journey and charge relay scarecrow; wasteland "ribs" mirror internal states via tactile action. Recurrent leaf/object as micro-setting enables climax choice. Environment shapes final walk-back image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (closeness) signaled early, textural escalation via decoding deepens to relay activation, narrowing options with agency in leaf-lift. Cost felt in "distance hardened into a crust" and foreclosed immediacy. Single tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars speaking emerges organically from cylinder grooves to final "every scar... speaks in colors"; ending reweights distance as lens without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in walk-back realization satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("farewell by color") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from wild hush to charged dusk. Stable single-POV, no elision issues. Voice as character reflects ledger-keeper mind under stress, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "grooves were scars") integrated into action; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Propulsion clear in dusk sequence. Zero artifacts in closure, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc lyric via phonograph secrets and leaf signal transforms tropes; risk in voice heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from riddle to crow's voice; non-obvious premise integral to closure.</comment>
