<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's skeptical interiority shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—disbelief as "a question with chairs," yet staying to align the tile and share losses—earning the final shift to believing in "careful frames." Courageously kind trait constrains micro-choices like offering Lio tea amid truth-telling. Final room-sharing moment reveals embodied emotion and hierarchy of values with visible cost of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build density from journals, tile alignment, whale spirals to resonant reconfiguration in the "room" with chairs, where griefs "exchange coats." Orientation anchors early in tower/sea/whales. Closure RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page with felt cost in narrator naming losses; persistent tile/whale constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (sea's "inhale/exhale," whale "flukes sketched time," tile's "sums steadying my pen") reflects skeptic's priorities, constraining choices like aligning tile to "whale road." Micro-setting of tile charges final image as sums "cool into balance." Atmosphere tensions mysticism with discipline, mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpt reflection sans reason-surrender) signaled early, tightens via textural deepening: shell placement rustles pages, transcribing spirals to mother's name, forcing narrator's loss-sharing. Agency in aligning/scribing forecloses skeptic isolation with relational cost. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of discipline braiding sorrows emerges organically from tile use, pattern-following, to final "unheard symphony becomes music"; resonant non-literal answer in room's "gravity agreeing to share its center." Subtext in silences/implications avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise without thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (patterns as "footprints in a dark orchard") biases toward symmetries, modulating rhythm with pressure (short sentences at breach: "We kept working... A cold front arrived"). Stable POV, no head-hopping; voice reflects skeptic's poetic precision. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: images like "whales rose, leaving spirals of air" multi-task imagery/advancement. Rhythmic variety (long poetic opens to crisp beats) passes ear test; no loops/scaffolds. Minor deduction for figurative density bordering overwrite in opening (e.g., "stone rib cage facing constellations") without mid-beat pattern-teach, but purposeful in textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square, whale migrations, skeptic auditing "griefs written sideways" transforms trope of mystical artifact into discipline-tool. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes (patterns "sought company"), inevitable in hindsight. Non-obvious moral calculus: skepticism yields not to magic but "currents couple distant shores."</comment>
