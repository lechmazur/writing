<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like pocketing the brooch amid gulls' cry, compel the pact; wryly earnest trait reveals through keeper's barnacle apology and shared heat at seam. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in solo wakefulness yielding to companionship. Final endurance of pact earns change with keeper's silent weeping as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from brooch find to seam pact, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as gnat release reconfigures island-memory relation with conceptual cost in "smallest history lifted into night." Orientation anchored early in tidal island post-wars. One tightening via keeper's recognition narrows to shared return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tidal island and rain trails constrain choices (lead to brooch/seam, revive at dusk); foxfire-lit seam and peat crack charge final image as micro-setting. Sensory selectivity (wind's teeth, surf names) mirrors haggard awe. Recurring tides evolve with events, pressuring pace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh meaning/restore memory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via brooch recognition to gnat exchange, forcing renunciation with visible cost in keeper's weeping and paint-smeared steadying. Agency in prying resin forecloses isolation. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at mother's fog emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of costly exchange emerges organically from brooch-gnat pact, mother's "exchange we could bear" reweighting endurance over loss without moralizing. Final "brightness" image resonates as non-literal answer to threshing meaning, charging prior motifs. Ambiguity lingers in island's silences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (rain trails as "nerve pathways," tides "reasoning"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "heat moved through us the way tides reason." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("what the island had given me today"). Stable first-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Color is a kind of treaty" advances voice/stakes); varied rhythm, no loops or muddled metaphors despite lyrical density—pattern taught early pays off at closure. Propulsion aligns with beats, zero artifacts dulling gnat-release image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-wars tidal mythos with amber-gnat release transforms heirloom trope into pact with land; risk in lyric compression heightens resonance without obscuring seam climax. Inevitable hindsight from rain trails to "pact pinned...with salt."</comment>
