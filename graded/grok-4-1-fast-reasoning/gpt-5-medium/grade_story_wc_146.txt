<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tuner's motivation to restore balance is embodied in pacing footsteps despite urgency "playing his ribs like strings," earning communal commitment; mother's wariness adds crucible pressure. Minor slip: archetypal mystic lacks sharper blind spots complicating a peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from solo fork strike to group footsteps and bell toll, landing Charged Poise closure in "the town answered with feet," with cost legible in "hours or for seasons." Orientation anchored early under archway; lens holds cleanly to reweight shared rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sound-centric setting (cobblestones, cistern chord, cracked bell) constrains choices via tuner's pacing and charges final archway sleep; sensory hierarchy sharpens under POV bias for dissonance. Ancient archway as micro-setting evolves from "gate to absence" to "throat clearing."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communal revival tightens accumulatively via solo-to-group escalation, agency in inviting "bring a willingness to walk," cost felt in patient endurance foreclosing quick fixes. Bell toll as deepening reweights options with relational thaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unglamorous shared rhythm emerges via particulars like scuffed sandals and braided feet, resonant non-literal answer in sparrow-town harmony without moralizing. Final image recharges "covenant of sound" with practice's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sonic diction ("dark tongue wavered," "silence sparkled") modulates rhythmically under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, tuner's idiom distinct from mother's. Stable third-limited, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied read-aloud rhythm mirroring footsteps; purposeful metaphors cohere in lyric sound pattern without muddle or loops. Minor figurative density in opener teaches payoff cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic mysticism reviving town via footsteps transforms ghost-town trope; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via fork-archway reprise.</comment>
