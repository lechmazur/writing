<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interior contradiction shines in swearing off the flute yet uncasing it under failure's pressure, with embodied emotion in the warming reed; final tempo change earns renunciation with penance cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density to closure's Resonant Reconfiguration (seam knits clean); orientation anchors early in range and post-guardianship; cost legible in "penance and my profession."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood and talus constrain markers/navigation; canyon hush and thinned air charge choices; recurring ravens mirror internal warnings, charging final image per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (insights from failure) tightens accumulatively when second note cools air unnaturally, forcing humble weave; agency in tempo shift forecloses pride path with market's bruise-silence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Humility-through-weaving emerges implicitly from miscounts/pride ledger to exhaling awnings; final driftwood lane resonant without moral, reweighting shortcuts' emptiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "listen slantwise" and reed-memory; rhythmic control modulates hush to gathering murmur; no head-hopping, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with motifs like "avalanchingly quiet" propelling via varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (worlds as loom/seams); peak clarity in seam-knitting image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-flute weaving transforms portal tropes via driftwood humility; risk in poetic voice heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at raven apology.</comment>
