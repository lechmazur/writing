<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in hands that "remember the shapes even when his eyes sting," compelling higher-stakes crafting; final loosening of ache earned through prior micro-choices in polishing and folding, with visible cost of partial resolution. Abbess applies targeted pressure via spiral map and instructions. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from polishing to vision rupture ("the shadow he lost walks in") to crane release, yielding Charged Poise RR closure where shadow touches but loosens ache without return—cost legible in "hoarse as a knotted rope" laugh. Orientation anchored early in climb to floating isle; single scene with taught spiral progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Glass basilica's "shimmering ribs" and "choir of prisms" constrain workspace and charge lungs with color, mirroring internal grief-to-light shift; stairs' descending ascent tastes of "cellars" in heights, guiding pivotal climb. Sensory selection (chiming stones, hissing kettles, jasmine steam) reflects craft urgency, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fold grief via cranes to reclaim shadow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through vision rupture and steam-bent wings that lift "shard of ache"; agency in transforming/brewing forecloses full return, with cost in loosened but absent weight felt at chest touch. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief's transformation emerges organically from particulars like ribbons/shadow and steam cranes; final "faint hand... touches his chest" reconfigures loss as survivable release without moralizing, reweighting prior imagery (ribbons taken, ache folded). Ambiguity lingers in partial solace, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable, perceptual signature in light-folding bias ("thicken light," "fold grief into origami cranes"); diction/rhythm modulate with intensity, compressing at vision rupture while sustaining texture. Abbess dialogue natural/subtextual ("You will find our stairs familiar"); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "polishes because the lanterns must sip dreams"); metaphors coherent/patterned (folding, sipping, cradling) without muddle, rhythm varies for propulsion—short at release ("The cranes stir"), longer for buildup. Zero loops, scaffold, or overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-loss fantasy with lantern-craft lyricism transforms grief tropes via irreplaceable particulars (vapor cranes, dream-sipping lenses); bold spiral structure/ending risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from opening detachment hook.</comment>
