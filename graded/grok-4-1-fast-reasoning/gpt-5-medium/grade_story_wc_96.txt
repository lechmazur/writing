<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of molting fear act in scene ("press my palm to my chest to keep the fragments friendly"), compelling higher-stakes collaboration; final endurance earned by prior urgency before personality shift. Lio applies immediate pressure via shared history and motion. Voice particularizes vagrant traits through penny verbs and copper senses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tin reveal to people gathering and rebuild, culminating in Charged Poise RR ("We leave the map... clinks closed... let us practice until dawn") with legible cost of siren graze and impending molt. One tightening via strangers' arrival reconfigures resistance. Orientation anchored early ("rusted library under stars"); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring objects (pennies, tin) constrain choices (engraved invitations draw strangers) and charge final image (tin "clinks closed with a sound like a page turning"). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: rain/iron skin, wind harp, graphite dawn. Spatial choreography clear in aisles/lantern/fence evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge beauty pre-molt vs. demolition) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via people/strangers' integration and siren endurance, forcing stance crystallization in rebuild. Visible cost: shelves "stop shivering," door "click... promise," but molt fragments pressure. Agency in penny spill and reading narrows to practice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-from-anarchy emerges organically via particulars (penny map pattern "like a throat clearing"); final CR reweights premise ("blooming resistance breathes, broken and bright") without moral, lingering ambiguity of city's teeth marks. Subtext in silences, like unflinching siren.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: poetic fracture/noticing ("pockets chime with copper syllables," "wind smells like graphite"). Rhythm modulates with intensity (short declarative rebuild beats). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Beauty is not a treaty... a practice"); stable first-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "pennies inked with phrases we can spend" advances plot/character/theme). Varied rhythm passes ear test; figurative consistent/lyric-taught early, no muddle or loops in peak (rebuild/siren). Zero scaffold; propulsion mirrors scene cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms vagrant trope via molting pennies/map as resistance currency; fresh synthesis of anarchy/beauty in "luminous fracture" pattern feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk (personality molt as constraint) heightens stakes without gimmick, recharging prison spark at closure.</comment>
