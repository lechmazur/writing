<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Specific interiority shines in embodied planting of the seed, revealing contradictory impulses toward profit pressures and quiet innovation; micro-choices like drafting rules on a napkin earn the closing commitment with felt cost. Minor idealization limits visible blind spots or mistakes in the rehearsal pitch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from seed arrival to Charged Poise closure in the bow and final image of seed/pot/note; orientation anchors early, cost legible in "locking...against dilution." No causality breaks; pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brook and annex micro-setting constrain choices (planting by window for "river's approval") and charge final image with "brook kept the door's shadow"; sensory details (cedar, ozone, damp planks) selectively filter through receptive POV without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (innovation vs. landlord/profit) signaled early, tightens texturally via seed-inspired deepening that forces trade-offs like limited admission; agency in planning/rehearsal forecloses spectacle path with on-page cost of "trickle" profit. Minor abstractness softens visceral pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship over spectacle emerges organically from seed planting and planning, with final image ("seed kept its counsel, and possibility kept watch") offering resonant non-literal reweighting of prior pressures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (brook as interlocutor) and rhythmic modulation sustain single stable POV; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure poise without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulative beats, with metaphors like "moonlight braid with current" integrated purposefully; minor paraphrase loops in brook/silence recurrences dull some propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape room proprietor with corpse flower seed transforms innovation trope into lyric stewardship; risk-taking in poetic elision heightens closure stakes, feeling inevitable from seed's arrival.</comment>
