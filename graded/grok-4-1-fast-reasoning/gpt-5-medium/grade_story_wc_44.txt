<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Budding rune scholar's motivation intensifies through embodied practice, with "quietly deliberate" trait constraining impatient action into looped ritual; final signing with rune for witness earns relearning as visible cost under pressure. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in tracing nodes amid trembling sky.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mirrors multiply doorway and shadows hum revelation, culminating in CR closure ("line slipped under my skin") with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchored early ("floating isle...observatory"), one tightening via inward step reweights knowledge without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating isle and observatory constrain via "mirrors in a ring like a throat" and "noon nested beneath night," charging final gold line image; sensory selection (iron winds, fork thunder) reflects rune scholar's perceptual bias, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows at noon) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through density surge in mirrors/doorway and agency in rune-whisper/turning key nine times; cost legible in skin-embedded line foreclosing impatience, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loops/return emerges organically from particulars like pinned constellations and spoon tremors, resonant CR in "shadows wait inside decisions" reweights premise without moralizing; final island breathing noon charges ambiguity with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with perceptual signature ("ink behaves like weather") stable in first-person, modulating rhythm under ritual pressure; caretaker's sparse "Wind that" carries subtext, no head-hopping, elisions purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring loops ("repeated, then repeated again" purposeful); minor figurative density in peak ("multiplying doorway of uncast shadows") coherent, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune scholarship, floating isle, and shadow ontology via loops transforms tropes; risk in lyric circularity ("relearn the alphabet of loss") heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "noon without a sun."</comment>
