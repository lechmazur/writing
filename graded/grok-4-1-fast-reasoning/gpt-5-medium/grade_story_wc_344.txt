<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Locksmith's motivation to learn repair's rhythm drives micro-choices like gear adjustments and bottle uncapping, rooted in embodied memory of mother's waves; internal endurance of "borrow and never own" earned via prior causality without tidy epiphany. Contradictory nostalgia and competence act in scene, charging closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of driftwood/tidal repair motifs builds density to mirrors, uncapping as cadence shift uncurves path, culminating in CR of mutual repair with legible cost ("cadence he could only borrow"); orientation anchored in first paragraph, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frozen library, rime lectern, and beach-room tables constrain choices (breathing into gloves, gear handling) and charge final dawn image; sensory selection (thin air ringing, cedar balm on glass) reflects repair urgency via POV bias, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rhythm of repair) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mirror-clocks tightening to room-tuning; agency in adjustments forecloses misfiled time with felt cost of traded attentions, reweighting options in beach ledger hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of repair as tidal rhythm emerges organically from particulars (gears, cedar breath, notched wheel), final image of nodding to younger selves reconfigures mutuality without moralizing; subtext in mirror intentions and borrowed cadence lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (tidal/clock metaphors) modulates rhythmically under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise of leaving gear/key, diction biased toward repair idiom without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied syntax, no loops), metaphors cohere in tidal/mirror pattern without muddle; peak mirror beat flows read-aloud, concrete images replace generics, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith repairing time-memories via eclipse keys and beach-ledger transforms tropes; risk-taking in hall-of-mirrors intentions and mutual thaw heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
