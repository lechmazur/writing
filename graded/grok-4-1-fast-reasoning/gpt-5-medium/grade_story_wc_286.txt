<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Potter's zen traits shine in micro-choices like kneeling to touch hives and singing a note, embodying non-forcing tenderness that earns her realization; interiority concrete via clay metaphors tying to landscape memory. Final endurance to practice kindness wherever shows earned change with departure cost. No stock phrasing; flaws in gentle insistence complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from glass visions to thrum escalation, culminating in CR where kindness anchors fractures, reweighting resistance premise with conceptual cost in "shawl of times." Orientation anchored early in arrival; one tightening via threads braiding suffices. Closure image of leaving cups legible with before/after reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hives, troughs, lantern glass constrain choices—glass reveals timelines, clay from troughs enables firing—and charge final image as she gathers it to leave. Sensory hierarchy potter-specific: sun patterns, thrumming air, dusty wood tactile and biased to hands/clay. Atmosphere mirrors internal via phototropic leaning; no white-room, vivid evolution from shimmer to hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding resistance—tightens accumulatively as kindness acts shift threads/bees/thrum, narrowing forceful change option with her resource costs (water, breath). Agency in filling dish, cleaning frames forces reconfiguration; visible price in tiny kiln patience alters tactics. Escalation coherent under lens, climax charged by interwoven timelines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of steady kindness enabling gentle change emerges implicitly via glass threads braiding and oasis response, answered non-literally in "resisted change by practicing it gently." Resonance from particulars like child’s flag, no moralizing; final shawl image reweights premise with anchoring cost. Subtext in "hold without forcing" lingers ambiguously complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in light/clay noticing ("sun braided three threads"); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity without head-hopping. Voice texture distinct—syntax breathes like "slow kick wheel"—consistent under stress. No dialogue; elisions purposeful, taught via patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "lids ajar like mouths too tired to pray" advances setting/atmosphere/mood); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent/patterned (light braiding, phototropic), no muddle in peak thrum beat. Propulsion tightens to dusk sitting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc lyric via timeline glass, phototropic oasis, potter's tenderness transforming resistance trope. Risk in fractured visions pays off, inevitable hindsight from sun patterns bookending. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes organically.</comment>
