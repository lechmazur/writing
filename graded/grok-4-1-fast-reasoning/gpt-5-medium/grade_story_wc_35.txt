<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chef's tasting ability creates contradictory impulses—tempted by filament yet careful not to pose as savior—earning the cooking choice; keeper's transmitted memory via touch reveals his gate-unbarred flaw, compelling transformation with embodied rust in gums.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density from puddles to pavilion to broth reconfigures options; closure as Charged Poise lands in keeper standing taller and puddles vanishing into salt rings, with cost of borne-not-erased memory legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Puddles constrain path via scalloped analysis; coral pavilion's ice charges tasting beat, mirroring internal brittle states through tactile contagion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of handling contagious remorse tightens via touch transmission, forcing agency in cooking; cost unmistakable in brass-scoured throat softening to bearable silt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming remorse emerges organically; final broth image offers non-literal answer, reweighting archive via "sandpaper passed once and the wood agreed to be touched."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tasting memories and puddle-reading biases all sensory filters; voice modulates rhythmically without leakage, as in "mouth full of borrowed thunder."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in lines like "blistered peppers until they hissed like dunes"; coherent metaphors avoid muddle, varied rhythm supports ear test despite occasional poetic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of memory-tasting chef and desert coral pavilion archiving remorse feels inevitable; risk in surreal logic heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
