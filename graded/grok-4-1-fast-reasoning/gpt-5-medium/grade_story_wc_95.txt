<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's mechanical arm embodies motivation through humming math and parries; contradictory impulses shine in fencing ideas vs. steel. Liese and Rook apply pressure via status shifts (diplomat's mercy on shoulder). Minor abstract interiority ("waiting most muscular verb") doesn't touch closure choice of signing/entering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: image density (needle, sundial, shadows) builds to CR closure—"floor untied itself... stepped down"—with conceptual cost of entering question. Orientation anchored early (atrium/brook by para 1). One tightening: Rook's lunge at map forces anvil block, narrowing to collective signature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atrium glass/panes constrain decoding (needle aligns with seam, catches noon); brook mirrors cadence, evolves to "shallow applause." Micro-setting (sundial smear/primer) charges final shadow-gate image. Sensory hierarchy (light chaos over others) fits duelist-philosopher POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode message to destination) signaled early; escalation via Rook's thesis-thrust and sundial rearrangement narrows to trade-off (lose/proceed). Agency in riposte and invitation to Rook forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in "faltered... invitation to lose and proceed simultaneously."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (philosophy as address/door) emerges from particulars (needle redirects questions, sundial shadow-gate); final "walked into the question... erasing need for answer" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in Rook's grin/mercy avoids tidy moral. No thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light skittered... dignified chaos"); voice modulates from argumentative stillness to jazz-metronomes under stress. Minimal dialogue subtextual ("door cannot be fenced, only entered"); POV stable, no leakage. Rhythmic control peaks in "steel snipped... conversation held responsible."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "tipped... chiseling shadow"); varied rhythm/syntax propels without monotony. Minor figurative density ("lines leapt like notes") coherent under taught poetic pattern, no muddle in fencing beat. Zero loops; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: philosophical fencing decodes sundial-gate via needle/shadows, transforming duel trope into destination-address. Risky poetic voice/accumulative drive inevitable in hindsight; no derivatives, bold premise commitment to closure image.</comment>
