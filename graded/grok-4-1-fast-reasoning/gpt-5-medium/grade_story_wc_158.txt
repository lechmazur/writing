<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via indexed heartbeats and tidal motives; contradictory impulses surface in resurfacing doubts versus unstoppable hands lifting at vow; earned change from vigilance to gentle tending visible in final nap between heartbeats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to RR closure (Charged Poise in vow and glowing walls reconfiguring pain stake) with felt cost of renouncing solitude; orientation anchored early in shell/tides; no debt as disorientation serves poetic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell constrains via drip/creak voice advising patience and extruded gardens; sensory selection (ink/salt/nacre) mirrors internal mercy; recurring nacre whorls charge final atlas, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pain-to-beauty) signaled early, tightens via Gardener's arrival after fifth cycle forcing vow trade-off; agency in humming/micro-choices narrows vigilance path with legible cost in steadied climate; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pain's treaty emerges implicitly from thorn gardens and pearl dust; final atlas reweights longing without moral, resonant via particulars; no overt statements, complexity in ambiguous truces lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic syntax/rhythm (e.g., "photosynthesize pain"); stable first-person focalization biases toward tidal/reef noticing; brief Gardener dialogue natural/subtextual, advances treaty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Verbatim repeat of "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" thrice triggers loop penalty; figurative density overwrites high-pressure arrival beat without full pattern payoff, dulling propulsion; rhythm varies but synonym churn in pain motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of shell/reef/armistice transforms insomnia trope via tidal chlorophyll; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at glowing closure; bold without gimmick.</comment>
