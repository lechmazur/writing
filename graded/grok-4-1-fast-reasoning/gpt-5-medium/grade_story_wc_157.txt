<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Charming rogue scholar's motivation roots in consistent cryptic defiance, embodied via seed-rattling under raid pressure; internal endurance forecloses permission-asking path with felt risk. Micro-choices like tracing maps and cupping seed reveal values hierarchy. Kline as secondary pressures via ants, forcing shared-revolution stance; minor archetypal polish but closure choice earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences, plant-messages, insect chaos reconfigures tax-rules via public "artistic rehearsal" clause. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in officers' laugh/step-over "ENTER," making before/after legible with raid-cost risk. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; pattern taught, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse/plants constrain choices (petal-language evades towers), charge final image (bees carry refrain citywide). Sensory hierarchy: bees/moths tactile under sweat-heat; POV bias selects defiant sparks in chitin/pollen. Evolving details (hornworms surge, lacewings punctuate) mirror chaos without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy thought-tax) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via garden-mapping to raid-concert tightening; agency in planting "RATTLE CHOIR TONIGHT" forecloses capture-path with on-page chaos-cost. Moral calculus: public performance vs. secrecy trade-off visible in "step over it and laugh."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (art/nature guards defiance-sparks) emerges from garden-messages, insect-truth; final "we keep watch" reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity (levy canceled yet towers persist). Resonance from particulars like calendula-consonants avoids morals; irony in auditors' unwitting performance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single first-person POV stable, perceptual signature cryptic-poetic (breathe sideways, footnotes dreams); diction/rhythm modulate to compression in raid ("wingbeats, footsteps, leaf shadows"). Kline dialogue subtextual ("ants... share"); no head-hopping, elisions pattern-taught via silences/plants.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short rattle-syllables amid long images); purposeful metaphors cohere (bees carry sentences). Minor overwrite in "converging chaos" reprise purposeful for tone; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: taxable-thoughts + plant-language subverts surveillance organically via "artistic rehearsal" clause; risk in poetic defiance heightens stakes (raid chaos). Irreplaceable garden-concert turn inevitable from mapped patterns; no template echoes.</comment>
