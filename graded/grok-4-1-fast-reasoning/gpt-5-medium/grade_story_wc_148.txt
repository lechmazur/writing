<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between false alarms and truer hush act throughout, culminating in earned renunciation at the drain where inheritance loosens; flaw drives micro-choices like lattice placements without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: lattice over drain reconfigures story-threading premise with conceptual cost of guiding the boat's questions; one tightening via lantern room ascent pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse reef and porthole keyhole constrain wandering choices; lattice as micro-setting charges final drain image, with sensory selectivity (copper stairs warm as coins) mirroring internal hush pursuit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of chasing hush escalates accumulatively through woman encounter and stairs to drain surrender, narrowing options with boat's approach; agency in lattice acts forecloses screaming echo path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming wolf cries to measured beam emerges organically from lattice confessions and drain hush; final image non-literally answers inheritance question, reweighting fables via brine promise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (hush as cupped animal, walls confessing) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks at "surrendered without words," with stable first-person POV and purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration (gulls laugh like verdict); minor overwriting in "copperlight repose" doesn't muddle closure, with no loops or scaffolds dulling drain beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-wolf inheritance in confessional lattice/lighthouse frame transforms tropes via hush pursuit; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens closure ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
