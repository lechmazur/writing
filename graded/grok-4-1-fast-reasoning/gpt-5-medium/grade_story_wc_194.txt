<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation rooted in mother's dying words drives micro-choices like cranking the gramophone and leaving the seal, earning the final unclenching with embodied cost ("throat tightened"); caretaker applies silent pressure without headcount bloat. Contradictory grief and relief act simultaneously in the revelation beat. Exceptional under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ledgers to ash confession, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure ("something inside me unclenched") with legible cost in vowed renunciation; single continuous scene anchored early ("sepia reading room"). No orientation debt; pattern taught immediately via crank.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sepia room, brass horn, and ash tray constrain choices (needle placement, tapping horn) and charge final image (horn exhales rain); sensory details (lacquer smell, throbbing hum) filtered through protagonist's priorities, evolve with events. Micro-setting as pivotal tool elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via musing-to-ash revelation that narrows options and crystallizes stance; agency in interpreting ledgers and pocketing crank forecloses rebuilding with felt emotional cost. Coherent pressure to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of merciful dynasty-ending emerges organically from ash words ("end the line to save the living") and final city image reweighting premise without moralizing; subtext in silence and resonance invites ambiguity on power's plague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eloquently silent," "golden shadows") biases noticing toward resonance and vibration; stable single-POV with rhythmic modulation under pressure (hum throbs to softens); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. Caretaker's gestures carry subtext without dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "plank by plank, from missing decimals to slanted pen strokes" advances intuition while propelling); varied rhythm passes ear test, metaphors consistent in resonance pattern without muddle or loops in peak ash beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious ash-standing-waves confession transforms inheritance trope via sound-as-text mechanics; fresh synthesis of vibration, silence, and ledgers feels inevitable, with risk-taking lyric frame heightening stakes to mercy realization.</comment>
