<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied actions like kneeling and angling the sundial under crisis revealing contradictory impulses toward solitude and coexistence; final endurance of tuning as independence earned with felt cost of ongoing vigilance. No stock phrasing or tidy epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to faltering hum crisis, then RR closure as song steadies shelves and breathing aligns, reconfiguring isolation into charged poise; cost legible in "hoofprints across gold" resolving to shelter word.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices, e.g., "walk slowly, so the floorboards remember my weight and do not turn liquid," and charges final image with cloudlight pooling; sensory details purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating isolation tightens via stone circle falter forcing song-agency, narrowing to tuned independence; cost visible in muttered realization "Independence is not granted; it is tuned" and ongoing preparation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges organically from particulars like aviary voices and herd song, culminating in non-literal shelter image reweighting isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "catalog what returns to me as weather"; rhythmic modulation builds intensity without slippage, POV stable and biased toward echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via images like "damp constellations drip across my wrists"; no loops or muddled metaphors, even in peak crisis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Surreal tidal library of extinct hours offers fresh synthesis of memory and ecology, with sundial tuning risk heightening stakes organically.</comment>
