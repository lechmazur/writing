<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particular to glass artist (e.g., "glass hears better than it sees"); adaptive trait shown in annealed choice with foreclosed paths (destroy vs. return); contradictory impulses in reflective pauses compel final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns/frost/ledger builds to Charged Poise CR in final paragraph ("fuse the ledger within a sheet"); cost legible in "midpoint... annealed" reconfiguring truth-handling; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon/stone/frost constrain choices (e.g., "frost's veins" match ledger edges, guide north) and charge final image ("canyon testify"); sensory selective via POV (resonance, chill bones); micro-setting (glass rod) sings payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose/expose rival via ledger) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via frost revelation and rival's laugh echo; agency in retracing/kneeling narrows options; cost in adaptive foreclosures unmistakable at "neither cold nor hot."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (purpose in pauses, adaptive truth via heat/hush) emerges organically from ledger/frost/canyon images; final reconfiguration ("letting purpose pour through the emptiness I shaped") reweights priors non-literally with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (glass/heat metaphors modulate intensity); rhythmic diction reflects artist mind (e.g., "song nested in stone"); purposeful compression taught early via canyon resonance, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in poetic rhythm; figurative language pervasive but voice-motivated/pattern-taught (glass motifs consistent); minor density overload in reflective beats dulls select lines without obscuring closure (e.g., "flaking its own moons").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glasswork forensics (frost-map ledger) and canyon-oracle testimony; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable ingenuity in "frost translate it for any watcher."</comment>
