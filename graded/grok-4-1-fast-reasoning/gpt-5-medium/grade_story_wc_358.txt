<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority via embodied actions like chalking arrows and radioing, revealing motive rooted in mentor's "practiced posture"; micro-choices under wind pressure show hierarchy of values. Child interaction forces adult economy nod, deepening competence with relational pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: survey density builds to corridor upload, tightening via dust devil "teeth and timing" countered on-page. Charged Poise closure lands with legible cost in "air will be different tomorrow" and inventory beat; orientation anchored early in port dawn entry. Lens unambiguous at helicopter slip into corridor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Container labyrinth constrains survey alleys and no-go spirals, charging final patch-as-windsock image; smells (salt, rust, fruit) and sodium lamps filter through professional bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows to wind eddies under urgency. Recurrent tape streamers evolve causally, mirroring internal hazy precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe landing via foresight) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through stalled cranes to hospital generator fail and circling chopper; survey agency forecloses turbulent path with tactic shift (20m north offset). Cost felt in "promise nothing, plan fiercely" and tomorrow vigilance. Single tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of foresight/action emerges via convergence motif shifting from trapdoor to refused corridor, answered non-literally in skids-kiss landing and town hum. Subtext in patch hesitation recharges premise without statement. Complexity in "hunting singular convergence" avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("canyons do not care about names") biases to vectors/habits; rhythmic syntax modulates from hazy survey to tight landing breath. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("means we can promise nothing"), advances via child tape placement. Stable first-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Ribbon tape flashes... slow animal breathing" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm accelerates in climb, breathes in upload. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative coherent under voice. Propulsion peaks in "skids kiss the pad quietly enough."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wind-as-canyon survey transforming post-disaster passivity into charged poise; inventive images like "dust devil... grow teeth" feel inevitable. Bold perceptual risks (air as conversation) heighten stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
