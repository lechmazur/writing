<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority particular via embodied cues like "heart tight" and metal's hum tying to grandmother's legacy; final planting earned by micro-choices under inversion pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to resin touch ("seam loosens") delivering CR in endurance images; orientation anchored in opening breath, closure cost legible in ongoing tending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Upward streams and floating arches constrain navigation, charging spindle as micro-setting in bowl; sensory hierarchy (water ribbons, sap gleam) mirrors quest without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (source of resilience) signaled early, deepens at echoes' gathering forcing touch with prickling risk; agency in following flow narrows to fusion under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges via particulars (arrow-spindle braid) reweighting resilience as "music that gathers, bends"; final exhale offers non-literal resonance without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in first-person, perceptual signature in "grammar of drips" and rhythmic modulation; inversion's compression taught early, legible at planting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("drip to drop"); purposeful figures cohere without muddle, no loops obscuring resin climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gravity-inverted orchards and echo-spindle synthesize memory-endurance boldly; arrow's fusion turns familiar quest fresh without gimmick.</comment>
