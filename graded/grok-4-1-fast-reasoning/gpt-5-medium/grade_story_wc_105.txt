<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via synesthetic perceptions like "blue is a far drum"; motivation intensifies through personal betrayal to earned imprint on past promises. Contradictory impulses in forgiving while forging absences show in the plate's reflection of "what never happened." Final devices' purpose forecloses naive trust with conceptual cost, earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from prototypes to personal forge, culminating in CR of "imprinting the living before the fracture." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse/shipwrecks. Cost legible in "each copy gentler," reweighting prelude over rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken orchard constrains calibration via shells/scars on twigs; aurora/shipwrecks charge final aisles walk as cells divide. Sensory hierarchy favors sound/color whispers, filtered through designer's bias. Evolving details like chiming shipwrecks mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sound of trust breaking) signaled early, tightens texturally via bowl on diver then personal plate, narrowing to prelude hearing. Agency in imprinting tests commitment; cost felt in "rooms stopped collapsing" and gentler replication. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memories as "ballast rather than ballast stone" emerges from particulars like compass bowl, reweighting absences into futures without statement. Final image answers prelude/recording question resonantly, embracing ambiguity in replication's gentleness. No moralizing; irony in betrayal's "mitosis" charges complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic diction ("colors come as whispers"); first-person stable, rhythm modulates from pacing to unfurling sound. Prose reflects fractured mind via fragment-like clauses. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors to present forge cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "absences grow edges, and edges sing"; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("drowned apple trees hold... ghosts ring") in early beats, but purposeful pattern pays off cleanly at closure. No loops; zero scaffold obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic hearing aids forging trust preludes from shipwreck absences transforms betrayal trope boldly. Premise synthesizes orchard/aurora into inevitable CR; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
