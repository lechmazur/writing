<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Queen's motivation rooted in dream-hunger intensifies via embodied micro-choices like sharing the flask and touching the stone self; contradictory impulses peak in "I do not want the throne to end... but I cannot serve it as a ghost," earning the integration with visible cost of altered sovereignty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dream-images (cobalt grotto, bleeding stars, threads) builds to closure's RR (Charged Poise) as stone self unstitches and pool calms, reweighting omen as road with conceptual cost of unforgiveness legible in final warning echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mountains' "ribs cut the dusk" and ember grotto's "warm ash" constrain climb's urgency; cobalt grotto's "stars an opening instead of a pin" charges final image, mirroring internal unmaking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams) signaled early tightens accumulatively via wanderer's pauses and crescent key, narrowing to wake/choose with agency in brow-touch; cost unmistakable in "who you will not be able to forgive."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of power/mercy knotted emerges from thread/moth/flame images shifting at "let the moth lead you away from the flame"; final pool "calm as an eye that had decided to watch" reweights prophecy non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (dreams "curling around her name," starlight "bleeding and returning") modulates rhythmically; sparse dialogue subtextual ("You are late" pulls forward), distinct from queen's softly commanding reply.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("wind combed her braids with a softly commanding patience"); coherent metaphors (unstitched breathing, lacy menace) in peak beats avoid muddle, though minor figurative density in climb risks slight opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis transforms queen's flight into internal dream-unstitching with moth/flame reweighting; bold lyric risk (stone self integration) heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
