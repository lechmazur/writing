<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to strip drama from reality drives concrete micro-choices like tracing dust spirals and pinning plastic, earning her endurance in modest recovery; interiority particular via pulsar habits embodied in sweeping reflexes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density builds from solo sweeping to communal mapping toward CR closure in dust resettling image, reweighting spectacle to patience with legible conceptual cost of unspectacular symmetry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices like pinning sheet to slow bleed and charges final slide image; sensory details (algae slick, silt whispers) filtered through Mara's sequential bias vividly evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of calibrating gentle change tightens accumulatively via solo-to-group escalation, narrowing to shared algorithm with felt cost of foregoing theatrics in "modest" plan that forecloses dramatic fixes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patient accumulation over explosion emerges organically from dust/pulsar parallels, resonating in final blow across slide that reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (reality as sequences, patterns in cracks) stable in single POV, modulating rhythm for quiet intensity; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (math metaphors) propels without loops, though minor density slips in repetitive "gradual change" phrasing; rhythm varies read-aloud, clarity intact at dust finale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and post-flood cleanup via dust patterns transforms recovery trope; risk in sustained lyric texture heightens stakes of noticing without gimmickry.</comment>
