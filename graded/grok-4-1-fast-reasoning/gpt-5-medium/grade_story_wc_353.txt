<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between symphonic ambitions and pulse simplicity act vividly in the shift from "symphonically minded" to "surrender cleverness," earning the final renunciation with embodied cost in slowed strums and left-behind music.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation in grove return; closure Charged Poise in tying insulator reconfigures silence into pulse with conceptual cost of impermanent art legible in "promise" and departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Alder trunks, roots, and porcelain insulator constrain choices (threading, strumming) and charge final image of tied promise; sensory selection (bark empathy, dew glow) filters through sculptor's perceptual bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of coaxing tree words tightens texturally from rumor-sound to heartbeat pulse, narrowing options via realization grove "wants a companionable heartbeat"; agency in micro-strums forecloses symphony with felt cost of small motions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of art as shared remembrance emerges organically from particulars like unsung fibers and withheld words; final image of hush-followed departure offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tree-trunk tuning and bark-listening; rhythmic control modulates from whisper register to inward sigh, stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, but "empathy in motion" patterned repetition borders paraphrase loop across three instances without full causal escalation, slightly dulling mid-beat propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tree-song sculptor premise synthesizes nature empathy and brittle insulator ingenuity into inevitable pulse reconfiguration; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens stakes of silent creation without gimmickry.</comment>
