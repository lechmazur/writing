<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentinel’s motivation rooted in mother’s legacy and revolution feels earned through micro-choices like quill use; contradictory calm amid risk shown in Rhun confrontation. Fara and Rhun apply precise pressure without stereotypes. Minor abstraction in embodied emotion (e.g., "grinning sunrise") prevents peak excellence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: Rhun’s nod reconfigures alliance with felt intrigue cost ("someone clears a throat"). Orientation anchors instantly; single contiguous scene fits scope. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fort’s blackout and workshops constrain choices (vents, regulators); quill holder as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory filter (iron-rain corridor, coals under ash) POV-specific and purposeful. Spatial choreography clear through descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dim fort for town’s night) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Rhun’s challenge forcing invitation with relational cost. Agency in "I do, I say" forecloses confrontation path. One deepening suffices; cost legible in captain’s throat-clearing pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of consent-over-control emerges via images (doors’ consent, dimmed lighthouse); final "guarding consent instead of fear" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in Rhun’s nod carries ambiguity without sermon. No moralizing; complexity in revolution’s quiet risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("winking hush," "humming behind slatted door") biases noticing toward intrigue motifs; stable first-person POV with no leakage. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Let the fort breathe"); rhythm modulates under Rhun stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in blackout, longer in workshop); high density advances multiple layers. Purposeful metaphor density (hush, sparks) coherent, no muddle or loops in peak (Rhun beat clean). Minor figurative density edges from perfection in mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lockpicking revolution as "breath-thin" intrigue with quill-key transforms heist tropes. Risky poetic voice commits fully, heightening stakes via sundial codes. Non-obvious moral calculus in Rhun’s one-degree nod feels inevitable.</comment>
