<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene ("command clung to her like damp clothes" vs. listening "as one listens to a sullen apprentice"), earning the final renunciation of control with embodied cost ("small unfixing in her chest"). Interiority concrete and plant-particular; micro-choices under storm pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from storm observations to ledger and speech, culminating in Charged Poise RR ("She did not name the vow... the trellis heard") with conceptual cost of dismantled certainty legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (nursery, storm season, river); no lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of weather shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and linden leaf recur as micro-settings constraining choices (shelter after rain, final press "felt the roughness bless her palm" charges closure image). Sensory details POV-biased (roots thinking, knots sigh loose); weather causally evolves, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. release in tending) signaled early, tightens texturally via deepening observations ("plants working out their own calculus"); agency as attention/renunciation forecloses reconstruction path with felt cost ("every knot... sighed loose"). Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens, one decisive cadence shift sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of care as subtraction emerges organically from particulars (ivy chooses post, jasmine braids hop); final image ("garden could hear itself through her") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in implications (plants rehearse courage); complexity lingers in ambiguity of listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hear roots thinking," "veined like a map of untraveled roads") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short sentences in wind thud). Single POV stable, lyrical compression taught early and legible at closure; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (boy's linden question).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-task (e.g., "Droplets clung... like second thoughts" advances image/emotion); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. Figurative language pattern-taught (rain/plant metaphors consistent), purposeful in lyric mode without muddle in peak reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anthropomorphic plants ("sullen apprentice," "own calculus") and nursery stakes transforms epiphany trope into textured metamorphosis; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via linden leaf reprise. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
