<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied scar and shard; contradictory impulses in fleeing kindness yet seeking hinge peak in "fierce tenderness cracking my ribs," earning the final renunciation with visible cost. Flaw of hoarded tenderness drives practice of stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of voices, reflections, and condensation builds to Charged Poise closure in "I will share the hinge and let it breathe us," reconfiguring stance with felt shame cost legible in shard's healing image. Orientation anchored early; pattern taught without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mangroves, skiff, lantern constrain navigation and anchor choices; shard and heron charge final path-as-listening image, mirroring internal pivot. Sensory hierarchy (sounds like rain, wet letters) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve unbruised hinge) signaled early, tightens via Mara reflection and spirits' teaching, narrowing to endurance of "not decide, not yet" with shard-wound cost. Agency in speaking apology forces stance crystallization under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hinge-sharing emerges from particulars like paused shoulder and unsent letters; final image reweights "silence not be armor" without moralizing, resonant via wound's "small white door."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "rain learning a language"; rhythmic control modulates from hum to "fierce tenderness," stable first-person with no leakage. Voice embodies cryptic medium consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (throats full of letters); minor figurative density in peak ("droplet words fracture") borders overwrite but coheres without muddling closure. No loops; propulsion via varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove spirits and cathedral shard transforms regret trope; risk in lyric quest heightens stakes, inevitable in "path feels like a listening" reconfiguration.</comment>
