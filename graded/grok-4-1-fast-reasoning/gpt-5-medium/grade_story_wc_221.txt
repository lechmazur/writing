<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blessed pariah status creates embodied contradiction (blessed for spared lives, pariah for darkness), compelling endurance in sketching amid drift; micro-choices like adjusting circle reveal values under pressure. Minor backstory summaries (reactor refusal) anchor present but slightly abstract emotional cost. Final renunciation of fixed north feels earned with visible scar-like marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from star misalignment to layered sketches reconfiguring confusion into navigable field (CR closure). Orientation anchored early (deck post-shutdown). Cost legible in "trusted the true north I had drawn," foreclosing fixed-point reliance with conceptual price of devotion's vein.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deck's time dilation constrains sketching (stars peel slowly, enabling layers), charging final image; compass rose as micro-setting reweights from ornament to past/present/elsewhere/return. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (city as beetles, dust hesitating). No white-room; evolved with dawn from directions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart true north amid migration) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glimpse of past self and applique realization, narrowing to new custom. Agency in patient drawing endures confusion's cost (headache tide). One deepening suffices; moral calculus in "We will not fear the dark we carry."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fluid true north emerges organically from particulars (migrating Polaris, stacked sketches), reweighting premise in final navigable field without statement. Resonance in scar/map invitations avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in dawn's directions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice distinct (rivers of stars, hush of clouds), perceptual bias character-specific; rhythm modulates from stretched silence to steady eyes. Compression taught early (temporally stretched corridor), legible at Charged Poise closure. No head-hopping; prose reflects stressed mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line layers image/insight); metaphors coherent in lyric pattern (petals unfolding, moss patience), no muddle touching closure. Minor paraphrase potential in "echoed silence" recurs purposefully. Rhythmic variety in sentence lengths supports slow-night cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-dilation lyricism transforms introspection trope via deck's physics enabling stacked anniversaries; risk in nonlinear time perception heightens devotion stake. Compass/stars reconfigure memory's lie non-obviously. Inevitable hindsight from grandmother's warning to drawn north.</comment>
