<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the narrator's "reluctant bones" tugged by Sori's hum, compelling the blind toss despite stellar doubt; final shame shedding as "husk from new fruit" earns closure reconfiguration with embodied cost. Sori's quiet enthusiasm applies gentle pressure via tending and marking. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through micro-choices like coin flips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from static bursts to coin flips, dome turn, distilling, and dome dilation yielding "corridor of usable silence"—a CR where "we were already on the far side," with surrender cost legible in the final exhale. Orientation anchors early in observatory vigil post-contraction. Pattern taught immediately, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ambered deck constrains via gyros turned and dilation swallowing gas clouds; coins as recurring micro-setting charge flips and warm palm at close. Sensory hierarchy (crackle shaded by callused palms, hiss purged) filters through POV's doubt. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to align with purpose tightens accumulatively via backwards prophecy forcing reverse actions ("having turned the dome, we had already..."), narrowing to trust in "blind toss" with cost of released causality. Surrender agency forecloses faith's brittleness. One deepening suffices, cost felt in "old shame...fall away."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty as cracked amber emerges organically from coin ceremony and noise intimacy, culminating in resonant CR: "matter following the memo" reweights reverse causality without moralizing. Particulars like featherlight coin chime avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in shoreless feeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cosmic lyricism ("coins rang like compact planets," "static...clumped into words") biases toward doubt yielding to hush; rhythmic modulation accelerates in flips, breathes in distillation. Stable first-person "we" as collective POV with clean interior access; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "prophecy filed backward across the glass" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies for ear, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak ("snow...clumped into words") coherent but borders overwriting, not touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reverse causality, coin lots in cosmic winter, and noise prayer transforms tropes; risk in lyric sci-fi structure heightens stakes via prophecy braid. Backward recipe and "causality ran uphill" feel inevitable from early particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
