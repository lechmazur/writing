<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyr's motivation to unmask via mirrors rather than blades is concrete and consistent, compelling subtle choices like placing the reliquary; Serane's tremor under polish yields earned confession. Interiority particular through patient observation, though contradictory impulses are more implied than simultaneous in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of books, ink, rune builds to RR closure in "Serane nodded, tears brilliant as a forfeit, and withdrew her claim," reconfiguring pretense with conceptual cost of undone identity. Orientation anchored early in library hush and Lyr's watch; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rune of drift constrains choices by aligning pages/nights, charging final image as Lyr guides Serane to column; dust motes, breathing shelves tactile and POV-biased toward timeless truths. Sensory selection purposeful, mirroring internal unraveling without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via books revealing comma/decree, ink staining finger, narrowing Serane's options to confession; cost legible in tears and reversed blade image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of subtle truth eroding pride emerges organically via ink climbing skin, rune translating context; final glossary-sealed scrap offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting pretender's forged signature without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in library-titan lens (constellations drifting, shelves as friends); rhythmic modulation peaks in "ink recognized kinship before law did," with stable third-person distance. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Follow the bookmarks"), goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "pressed storms" advancing texture/atmosphere; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops, though figurative density borders overwriting in opening without obscuring closure image of pellet resealed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diminutive titan librarian wielding ink/rune transforms ancient guardian trope; risk in lyric compression heightens poetic stakes of graceful undoing, inevitable in hindsight from early pattern.</comment>
