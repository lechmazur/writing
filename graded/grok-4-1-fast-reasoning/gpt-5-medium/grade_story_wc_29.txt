<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in cautious skepticism vs. interference choice, embodied in "I breathed in dust and stubbornness and decided to interfere"; final renunciation of tenure/ headlines earns closure with felt personal cost; no diagnostic speak, traits shown via actions like mapping charts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal discovery → trace to theater → interference narrows options; closure as Earned Stasis in "I wrote a reply in silence, a no shaped like listening" with cost of messy unowned life legible; orientation anchored early in radio shift; one tightening via phase inversion suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Radio boards "crackled like dry ice," theater cables "hummed like throat singing" constrain choices via equipment/tuning; charts as micro-setting charge final annotation; sensory hierarchy fits interpreter's ear for subsonics; no white-room, spatial moves track from booth to roof cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (counter signal's manipulation) signaled early, escalates via dean's refusal → theater discovery → wave's tenure offer testing resolve; agency in "broadcast countersigns" forecloses obedience with cost in "hiss became the sound of deciding"; cost unmistakable in unscripted tenderness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of breath over borrowed metronome emerges via interference beats, resonant in final annotation reweighting arguments as "crystal" resonance; no moralizing, ambiguity in trickster's "last gift" invites reflection; protagonist arc inextricable from outwitting via listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "static had tempers; silence had accents" biases toward rhythms; rhythmic control modulates from crackle to "friction became the sound of deciding"; stable first-person, no head-hopping; dean's calls carry subtext without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "It bent around speeches like wind around stone" advancing multiple jobs; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in climax tolerated as voice-motivated pattern; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic trickster via subsonic election signal, transformed through radio interpreter's interference; risk in ethereal campus grit heightens stakes; final "teach people their breath" feels inevitable from particulars, no template echoes.</comment>
