<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("Patience tasted of lake smoke and copper"); contradictory impulses in seeking answers vs. yielding to trance compel earned vanishing choice. Researcher's withheld knowledge creates crucible pressure without stock mystery. Final renunciation of persistence-dam costs relational space, scaled perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from stone-throw to trance vision; orientation anchored early ("floating rock meditation platform," "magnetic grotto"). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "I vanished where I hindered," reweighting presence with village-cost image undeniable on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto and pond constrain choices (pulls stone/time, platform dips/pulses); sensory hierarchy (hum, copper taste, no-wind flicker) filters via narrator's trance-focus. Final platform-steadying charges closure image without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (study disappearance via vanishing-to-appear) signaled early, deepens in trance-reversal showing dam-village. Agency in agreement forecloses hindering path with felt relational cost; lens escalation via pattern-cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing-as-gift emerges organically from rings-paths, trance-vision, final application; no moralizing, ambiguity in researcher's reverse-aging lingers. Closing image reweights premise non-literally: "followed the last ring... vanished where I hindered."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("rings braided... paths into breathing") stable, modulates intensity; sparse dialogue subtextual ("why I needed to know"). Rhythmic compression peaks in trance without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels accumulatively, metaphors coherent/pattern-taught ("knot by knot," "soft rope"); minor synonym loops ("steadied") in wind-down don't touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reverse-aging researcher + pond-rings method synthesizes fresh time/vanishing premise; risk of lyric elision pays off in charged CR. Irreplaceable grotto-logic transforms mystic tropes organically.</comment>
