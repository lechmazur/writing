<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "I could love him without closing the space," earning stasis through prior embodied ache and micro-choices like pressing but not descending the seam.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of code-grain alignments builds to CR closure in "the threshold become a companion," with legible cost in the "ache" of distance kept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bench grain and terrace seam constrain pivotal choice to press without descending, charging final image; sensory details like "wind smelled of sugar glass" filter through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake deepens via agency in aligning logbook to grain, forcing renunciation of descent; cost unmistakable in "breathed in that ache," reweighting options under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacred intervals emerges organically from corn rows to terrace seam, answered non-literally in "wind needs the fence to sing," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in maze/logbook diction ("necessary distances," "featherly determined") modulates rhythmically, stable first-person with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from "sap knot to sap knot" to closure image; purposeful motif recurrence teaches pattern without loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation codes on wood grain into maze metaphysics risks poetic compression that heightens stakes, inevitable in "compass made of breaths."</comment>
