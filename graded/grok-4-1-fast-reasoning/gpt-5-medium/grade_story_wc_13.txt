<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Illustrator's patience drives micro-choices like borrowing the hiccup and lingering to sketch despite time's tug, earning the final endurance with embodied cost in shaking hand and pulse memory. Contradictory impulses act in the release ("needed to be uncaged") versus sealing. Final choice forecloses safe departure, revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from canal cadence to oval larvae, closure as Charged Poise in sketching amid "nap tug the seconds," with legible cost in bells' mismatched count. Orientation anchored early ("rooftop canal system"). No causality breaks; pattern taught and paid in echo birth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rooftop canals, rails, sluice constrain choices (slips pendant along rail, palm through oval); sensory hush/rush cadence mirrors internal lilt. POV illustrator filters shadows/curvatures purposefully. Final inking recharges lichens/clouds as habitat, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (birthplace observation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to larva release narrowing options (uncage vs. trap), cost in "world lagged" tradeoffs and final tug foreclosing exit. Agency in widening oval, pinching seconds drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of capturing interrupted desire emerges via paired commas (desire/restraint), resonant in echo bloom passing "through me and made my drawing truer." Final sketch answers pursuit without moral, reweighting borrowed time's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (stubborn ink, curvature sketches) with rhythmic modulation ("hush, rush"); diction/prose reflects illustrator's patient eye. No head-hopping; elisions (pendant key) taught early, paid in oval formation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propulsion, varied rhythm ("cadence broke and did not resolve"); metaphors cohere (infinity oval, comma larvae) without muddle. Zero loops; closure image ("inked the rail, the lichens") clear, forceful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-borrowing pendant, giant-breath canals, echo larvae transforms tropes organically. Risky poetic density heightens stakes in larva graze moment, inevitable at echo refusal bloom.</comment>
