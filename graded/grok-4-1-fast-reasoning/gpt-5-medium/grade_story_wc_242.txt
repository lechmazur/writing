<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete embodiment like "spun it with a damp finger to tune her breath"; contradictory impulses in listening without wanting culminate in earned stasis of staying outside doorframes during climax loop. Final endurance forecloses entry with felt cost in steady wrist and cleaned disc. Single-POV voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds routines to crisis arcing, one tightening in child's thin voice looped to Rojo/Flora. Closure as Charged Poise in final image of tending switchboard reconfigures estrangement with conceptual cost of pruned growth. Orientation anchored early in booth/tunnel; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass disc as micro-setting constrains choices (tunes wires, thrums in crisis) and charges closure (cleaned with sleeve). Sensory hierarchy melodic/ tactile via POV (trains murmur, wires purr); tunnel sparks pressure in third-rail arc. Final image reweights environment purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of estrangement enabling connections signaled early, tightens in crisis loop narrowing options to loop strangers. Agency in wet-fingered switch and routing crew; cost legible in her non-entry and hush afterward. Escalation via textural density to child's groan.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of endings-beginnings emerges via disc's rim skating future, reweighted in final "open the gate with nothing but a quiet hello." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like pressed flower surviving dark. Protagonist arc inextricable, invites ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in melodic metaphors ("voices she would never meet," "wires purred like cats"); rhythmic control modulates from hum to thrum under crisis pressure. Stable single-POV, no leakage; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "looped their voices gently, not to deceive but to assemble rhythm"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak (disc's "thin chord") coherent and pattern-taught, no muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wrong-number therapy in mythic tunnel booth; transforms tropes via disc-tuned estrangement. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at ledger entry "The Lesson of the Opened Elevator." Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
