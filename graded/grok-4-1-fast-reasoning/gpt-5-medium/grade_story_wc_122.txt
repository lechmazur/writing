<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied contradiction in Mara's numbness "settled like frost beneath the ribs," fueling micro-choices like rigging the needle that earn her thaw, with Oko's hands applying secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from cavern entry to closure's Charged Poise in threading the filament, reconfiguring silence with legible emotional cost in "numbness loosened, like frost admitting it was water."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cavern's "velvet" hush and drumhead constrain the backward play, charging final image; sensory selectivity (smoke, salt, hides as moons) mirrors internal thaw without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of numbness signaled early tightens via density of "seams of music" to forward pulse, agency in threading forecloses numbness with on-page cost crystallized in posture naming tremors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of backward listening for forward tenderness emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR in final "hush she carried was no absence," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited perceptual signature (feeling flares "like a lighthouse") stable and biased to touch/rhythm; rhythmic control modulates pressure, elisions taught early pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax; minor figurative density in peak "tide unwinding" purposeful for textural lens, no loops obscuring closure though hush motif borders repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf tactility, reverse playback, and hush-as-presence transforms silence trope; risk of lyric compression heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
