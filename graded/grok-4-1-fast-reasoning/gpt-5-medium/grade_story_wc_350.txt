<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's harmonious choral librarian traits compel higher-stakes choices like interspersing languages with the elevator and gathering townsfolk empathetically decisively, earning the communal singing closure without epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase from elevator's confession to multi-bridge chorus reconfiguration; closure Charged Poise lands on-page in "the town, once siloed, cradles itself in a chorus" with felt cost of scars preserved and effort embodied in patient knuckles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Astronomical clock tower and silos constrain choices, as gears map revolutions inspiring bridges and catwalks host the stage; final image charges with bridges flexing in storms, borrowing starlight brighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of braiding siloed people tightens accumulatively from elevator's plea through gathering to bridges, with agency in Mara's sketches and downbeat; cost legible in "scars" un-erased and rope singing through palms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection via song emerges from particulars like languages dovetailing and elevator holding voices together; resonant non-literal answer in final chorus reweights silos from separation to breath without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musical metaphors like "new grammar of footsteps" and perceptual bias toward bridging patterns; stable third-limited POV with rhythmic modulation under hush of starlight, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax mirroring choral cadence, but minor figurative density in peak bridge-building ("planks settle into a new grammar") borders overwriting without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of talking grain elevator craving dinners and librarian's clock-weight bridges transforms silo tropes into song-bound community; risk-taking in animistic voice heightens stakes organically to inevitable choral cradle.</comment>
