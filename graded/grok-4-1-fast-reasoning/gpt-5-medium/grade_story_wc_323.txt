<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied longing for surface (chain link "heavy as a small moon"); contradictory impulses in teaching wonder while warning "wonder can drown"; earned realization at alien interaction forecloses isolation with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from teaching edges to alien return; CR closure in "the pattern we formed rose... I knew then how to teach them all," reweighting navigation premise with legible conceptual cost of "fall" into unfolded horizons.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Benthic details like "ceilings ripple like slow glass" and "knife line of shadow" constrain crawls and charge chain's tactile weight; recurring edges mirror internal states, evolving to alien signals without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of starlight navigation tightens accumulatively via night crawls and ray-sweeping reply to aliens; deepening at "rays intersect where a horizon folds" narrows options, with felt cost in volunteer isolation charging poise before CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of edges unfolding unseen pressures emerges organically from ray exercises to alien "blossom of planes"; final "let the horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stars are... pressures, imprints on the shape of the dark"; rhythmic modulation under pressure (short kicks in crawls) with stable first-person POV and purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from "slow breath lesson" to climax's turning planes; figurative language like "petals on a cold machine" coherent and voice-integrated without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of benthic sci-fi with alien edge geometry transforming navigation tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via chain-seeded longing to horizon unfolding.</comment>
