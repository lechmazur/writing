<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's obsession with patterns compels lying and posting despite job risk, earning final choice; contradictory impulses (team dismissal vs. pursuit) act in scene via "I told the team... but they shrugged." Internal voice particular and embodied in "holding a coat still warm."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of numbers and discoveries builds to CR closure: posting Driftwood reconfigures absence with job-risk cost legible in "risking my job and the hush." Orientation anchored early; one tightening at Sink entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Deep vault "cold and smelled like old servers" and Sink constrain access via lie and lyric challenge, charging final image of desk talisman; sensory hierarchy reflects archival bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. policy) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (numbers to diary to threats), narrowing to post-or-silence choice with agency and on-page cost in resurfaced voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-guided memory emerges organically from particulars like Flight 7421 telemetry; final "silence answered like surf" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting erasure premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("sensed absence," "silence shaped like a missing person") modulates rhythm under pressure; stable first-person, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; figurative pattern ("constellations from scattered salt," "threading a needle") coherent and purposeful, propelling via varied rhythm without muddle in discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archive as haunted beach with numbers as telemetry breadcrumbs; risky lyric structure heightens stakes, transforming missing persons trope into policy-confronting CR without gimmickry.</comment>
