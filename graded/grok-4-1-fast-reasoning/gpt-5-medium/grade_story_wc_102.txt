<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied through breath-image interplay; past-life mirror-maker flaw drives hoarding conflict to earned decanting. Contradictory impulses (hoard vs release) act in breath micro-choices. Minor diagnostic tone in "spiritually curious" explanation slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of breath/image/memory builds to CR closure in "storage closet unlatch behind my ribs" with felt cost of emptied jars. Orientation anchored early ("Twilight... viaduct in bloom"). One tightening via tear-dab surfaces memory, reweighting stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (vines as "shy comets," river "ribs of light") filter through POV's light-bias, constraining box placement on parapet and charging final "viaduct breathe easier." Micro-setting (camera obscura) shapes tactics. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release unused love) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tear/breath/memory to agency in "let us heal," narrowing hoard options with cost in "decant... emptied jars." Brief man encounter accents without diluting. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise end-image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hoarded love as "held breath" emerges organically from breath-practice and past-life, resonant in final "trail marker the future may follow" without moralizing. Final image reweights premise non-literally. Complexity in flawed hoarding avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/breath/weather metaphors) biases noticing; first-person stable, rhythmic syntax modulates build to peak. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("sending love to the places that kept it safe too long"). No head-hopping; elisions pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud (short punchy breaths amid flowing images); high density advances texture without loops. Minor figurative density ("river grows ribs of light") in peak risks slight muddle but consistent/voice-motivated. No scaffolds; propulsion ties to breath cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura as "interior weather" for healing hoarded love via breath transforms mystic tropes organically. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; "pilgrim of sparks" inflects uniquely. Inevitable hindsight from established light-motif.</comment>
