<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Logistician vividly embodied with contradictory jocular-tired traits driving micro-choices like assigning tasks under rain; earned change in shy rock handover and name mislaying shows visible cost. Narrator's passive observation limits deeper interior conflict but reveals values through final note-following. Strong under Accumulative lens but minor passivity caps at high strong band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rumor density builds to rain/power outage tightening, culminating in CR/Charged Poise via logistician's "It already has" realization and trolley arrival with reciprocity cost in owed favors/note. Orientation anchored by ~line 5 (station, logistician). Closure cost legible in "promising returns we meant" and final map of favors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy, leaking skylight, chalkboard constrain actions (boy names doorways, vines flag trolley) and charge final glowing station image. Sensory hierarchy (pigeon coos, sideways rain, green metal smell) reflects urgency and POV priorities. Micro-setting (moon rock, lantern tea) evolves causally, mirroring internal reciprocity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness cure via reciprocity) signaled early, escalates via density increase (rumor → outage → assignments → arrival) reweighting to connection under Accumulative lens. Agency in logistician's pairings/redirections forces trade-offs; cost unmistakable in circle promises and owed favors note charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from pact, postcards, note; final "holding one end...other" and glowing ledger offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in "take now, return later, different, real" avoids binaries. No thematic echo; earned from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "punchline waiting for its setup"); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity (short under rain). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("logistics...not miracle"); no head-hopping, elisions taught via rumors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "laughed like a tent being opened"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (rain "gutters sang louder"). Propulsion aligns with beats; minor figurative density in peaks taught as voice-pattern, no muddle at closure trolley beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rumor-logistics curing loneliness transforms tropes (disaster relief as kindness station); moon rock/trolley turns inevitable from reciprocity pattern. Bold lyric risk (poetic compression) heightens stakes coherently; no derivatives, specific details irreplaceable.</comment>
