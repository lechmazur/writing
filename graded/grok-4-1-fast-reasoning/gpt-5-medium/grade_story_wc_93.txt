<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's vow burns concretely in ribs and evolves through micro-choices like bracing the door, earning the final listener role; eel herder's curse aches in every accurate gesture, revealing contradictory prescience. Minor abstraction in "arithmetic of mercy" softens peak embodiment without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (dust, rocks, eels) tightens to RR closure: her sacrifice stitches door shut with legible cost ("for him to stay, she would have to go"). Orientation anchors in opening line; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal bluff's frictionless slipping constrains all motion, charging final rocks that "hold the shore to a course"; aurora lowers like a crown in climax. Sensory selectivity (sibilant grammar, cold silver) biases through narrator's seeking lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (brother's rescue via tide grammar) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through sequences narrowing options to her tethering; agency in agreeing and bracing forecloses chase with her cost. No live option left unpriced at door.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterns demanding embodiment emerges implicitly via rocks-to-spiral progression, reweighting promise from burning grief to "quiet engine" in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like inverse sequences answering symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lyric compressions like "sea sang like wire drawn through sky" sustains single POV without slippage; sparse dialogue ("Do not chase me") carries goal-driven subtext. Rhythm modulates seamlessly under climax pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative saturation ("velvet gravity," "sprouted points") in climax spiral risks coherence muddle (-0.4); no loops, strong verbs, varied rhythm. Read-aloud ear holds through aurora stitching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math-eels-dust in frictionless world transforms tropes organically; risk in non-causal patterns pays off inevitably at sacrificial door. No derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity throughout.</comment>
