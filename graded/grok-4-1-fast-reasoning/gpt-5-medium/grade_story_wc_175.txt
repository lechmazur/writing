<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Esoteric realist's contradictory impulses—suspicion of fantasy yet building signals—act in scene through micro-choices like knotting the moth wing, earning final endurance of transience with felt cost in "promis[ing] aloud to stitch their names from moss and echo."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of signals building to Charged Poise closure in final image of lying on moss waiting, cost legible in "transiently rooted" structures scoured by wind; orientation anchored early in grotto climb during migration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's water "tapp[ing] an interrupted cadence," wind gusts, and pollen constrain temporary signals, charging final moss-lie image; sensory details filtered through POV's patient attention evolve causally with monarch arrival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring histories tightens texturally via escalating signal complexity (reeds to fern heartbeat), hawk shadow as pattern break foreclosing permanence with cost in resumed "cadence, altered yet legible."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked histories knotted into "useful obscurity" emerges organically from signals and monarch's "bless[ing] the method," final image resonantly reweighting transience without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "burned syllable of orange" sustains rhythmic control through lyric compression; POV stable, modulating from attentive building to clarified waiting without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but figurative overload like "blushing stillness blossomed wider" risks coherence in peak reflective beats; minor paraphrase loops on "transiently rooted" dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of esoteric realism honoring larval keepers via butterfly signals transforms nature tropes; risk-taking in lyric method heightens stakes of impermanence without gimmickry.</comment>
