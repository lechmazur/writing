<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Caretaker's reluctance embodied in "thorned halo" duty and micro-choices like non-touch walking; contradictory want-to-leave vs. compulsion drives guidance with eternal cycle cost at closure. Boy's nut interaction reveals shy pride, adding relational pressure. Secondary characters apply timed urgency without overwhelming single-POV interiority; earned stasis in returning to rows seals high score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of orchard shifts, bird patrols, frost clock builds density to Charged Poise closure—"orchard loosened its hold, just a little"—with cost of coiling hours legible in final image. Single scene anchors early (caretaker/orchard/labyrinth by para 2); no orientation debt. One tightening via early frost suffices; pattern-taught elisions (blueprint memory) pay off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, shifting orchard constrain choices (specific traces, wait for patrols) and charge final image (birds wheel uncertain, caretaker vanishes). Sensory hierarchy (salt spray whispers, brass scraping) filtered via caretaker bias; lichen map as micro-setting enables doorway. Evolves causally (apple inversion on fear); no white-room, vivid yet economic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost) signaled early, escalates via lens density (patrol changes, hedges thinning) forcing tactic shifts like nut-lock; agency in assembly/impressions narrows options. Cost unmistakable in loosened hold but renewed duty ("another pair of boots"); single deepening via boy's nut integrates internal/external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of eternal bargains/cycles emerges from particulars (roots tighten, blueprint rewritten); final image reweights premise—duty's "graceless beauty" coils hours without moral. Nut reprise shifts from worry-wish to door-key, charging ambiguity of promises. No sermonizing; complexity in orchard's "reluctant amen" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("numbers lived in my throat," "praying and drowning"); rhythmic control modulates tension (short sentences in hurries). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("offhandedly exact"); first-person stable, no leakage. Voice as character: poetic compression taught early, peaks legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., "slipped between pear limbs... waited while flock sheared"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (apple "wooden bones"). Minor figurative density in descriptive beats pattern-taught, not obscuring closure image; read-aloud ear excels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cursed orchard's blueprint-memory + mechanical birds + non-touch walking transforms lost-traveler trope via textural duty-cycle. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes (frost clock amid poetry); final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
