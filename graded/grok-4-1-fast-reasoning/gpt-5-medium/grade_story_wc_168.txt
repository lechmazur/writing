<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in guilt (stepping past crying man) act in reflective scene, earning final relational reconfiguration with cost in "the old bargain shift like gravel underfoot."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from reflective buildup to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in empty box "lighter than guilt, heavier than air"; oriented early with ridge and box.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridge stone constrains repair ("press the paper against a warm stone"); recurring box and ash scents charge final image, mirroring internal states through tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate pain/return remnants) tightens via woman's arrival and joint repair under Accumulative lens; agency in weaving hand forecloses isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of legibility emerges organically from repair and names; final image ("calibrating his steps to the heavens") reweights bargain without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with fire-scarred perceptual signature ("scarred by heat and flying bark"); dialogue subtextual and idiomatic, modulating rhythm under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors ("brittle music," "small animal learning trust") propel without muddle; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fire-guilt and paper-chain repair transforms hero trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes, inevitable in joint "enlighten without preaching."</comment>
