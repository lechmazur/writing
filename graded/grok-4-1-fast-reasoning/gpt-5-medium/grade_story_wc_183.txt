<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses between discoverer and person selves act in scene, culminating in earned unclasping at bow; embodied via skin-crawling net and rib-thrum. Minor abstractness in emotions slightly detaches, but micro-choices like pouring soil reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build in motifs to CR closure; final jar-planting/breathing reconfigures discovery premise with conceptual cost of lost twin legible in "one hand letting go of the ledger." Orientation anchored early in ship/bay; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via adjusting corridors/hatch and charges final image (ship swings released/held); carousel horses point path tactilely. Sensory fog/salt/fur selective through POV anomaly bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find garden) deepens accumulatively via bargain/jar revelation, narrowing to renunciation trade-off; cost felt in "lose the twin" forces stance crystallization. Escalation coherent under lens, though internal abstraction mutes visceral punch slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgetting-as-freedom emerges organically from particulars; final image ("compass that pointed toward whoever I would become") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting memory-alter premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature (anomalies in tongue, narrative threads) with rhythmic control modulates intensity; internal voice coherent/specific, no slippage. POV stable first-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density in every sentence borders overwriting without varied payoff in peak exploration beat, dulling propulsion slightly; no loops, refrains patterned. Closure image propulsive.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of carnival decay/memory-quest transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable to CR, heightens stakes via irreplaceable ship-garden logic.</comment>
