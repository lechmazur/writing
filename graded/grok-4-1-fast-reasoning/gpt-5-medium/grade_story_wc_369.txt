<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in embarrassment over "quantified sorrow" until it works, compelling micro-choices like measuring dream dust with a teaspoon; final endurance of shared sorrow earned via tag-reading, with embodied ache in chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (pin, root, tags) densify pattern to CR closure: "measured grief will float," reweighting premise with cost of carrying archived sorrows; orientation anchored early in tower/maze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring root and sextant constrain excavation choice; final "every tree gleamed" charges image, mirroring internal shift through POV-filtered maintenance details like "dripping chains."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deconstruct grief, witness trees) tightens accumulatively via pin-to-tags progression, narrowing to reading with chest-ache cost; agency in aligning sextant forces trade-off of personal sorrow for shared archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of measured, witnessed sorrow emerges organically via tags as "minutes of meetings"; final "hear the register of their quiet" reweights prior dust-hills without moral, embracing ambiguity of floating grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in anthropomorphic maze/tree notices ("sighed like a sleeping boiler"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to hum, stable first-person with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in lines like "tags... stamped with a number and a word not in any language," propelling via varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors (crack as "sorrow line") taught early, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified dream-dust sorrow and tree-archived tags transforms maintenance trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via sextant/root alignment.</comment>
