<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motive rooted in traits compel micro-choices like passing mallet to Zaya, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene; competence dominates without flaws driving visible mistakes that compound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup (dubbing layers, tower, sistrum) tightening to RR/Charged Poise closure in final pear-sitting image; legible cost in constant obstacle-turning effort reconfigures storm passage, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid selective sensory details (clouds' "hems low and hoarse," pears' "winter lungs") constrain choices like spiral routes; recurring driftwood circle and mallet charge final orchard's "greener note," mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant survival stake signaled early via gale prediction, deepens accumulatively with fractal lattice and tower forcing trade-offs (deck tilts); agency in dubbing forecloses snapping paths with on-page cost like net hazard adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of obstacles-as-instruments emerges organically from dubbed elements and fractal patterns, reweighted in final silence-rewriting clouds without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in orchard's self-generated note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("resonance was a drawing that sound made inside things") with rhythmic poetic control modulates under pressure; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via strong verbs/images, but figurative density in peak gale beats (e.g., "white teeth," "mouth kissing another mouth") borders overwriting without full pattern payoff, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional fresh synthesis of musical meteorology on driftwood orchard transforms storm tropes into inevitable pattern; risk-taking in fractal/dubbing logic heightens stakes organically through closure image.</comment>
