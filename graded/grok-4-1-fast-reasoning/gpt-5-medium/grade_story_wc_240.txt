<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (vigilance vs. hosting anomalies like the cat), with final endurance of loosened grip earned by grief-anchored micro-choices; Kian reflection interleaves without flattening pressure. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in spatial metaphors. No safety-hedging; flaws complicate revolutionizing detection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of anomaly mappings builds to Charged Poise closure in final image ("light as a falling permission"), with felt emotional cost legible in palm-held rig. Orientation anchored early (Mara in farm domes). Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent caps and mist constrain choices (rig threads gaps, cat path coaxed), charging final glow amid trees; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (perimeters as melodies). Details tactile, integrated (spores wave, hinges complain). Micro-setting (rig, shelves) as pivotal anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revolutionize via letting go) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through cat/steam beats narrowing vigilance to hospitality; agency in micro-choices forecloses clenching with personal cost felt in "unhooking a tight dress." One tightening sufficient, charges final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of permeable barriers vs. walls emerges from particulars (fungi networks, cat guest), resonant non-literal answer in "quiet wildfire" reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in grief's lattice; no tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (space as music/embroidery) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates intensity (short sentences in steam fix). Close third stable, no elision; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in varied syntax mirroring release (e.g., "Steam whistled... hiss gentled"); no loops, metaphors coherent (light stitching, lattices). Zero artifacts; read-aloud rhythm natural, final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spatial giftedness, fungi security, grief-as-system; transforms vigilance trope into hospitality via permeable physics. Risky lyric frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight; no hedging, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
