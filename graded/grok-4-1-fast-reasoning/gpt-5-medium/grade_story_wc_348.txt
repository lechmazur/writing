<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via polymer-river metaphors; contradictory impulses in atonement vs. divergence resolved in earned design shift at "I named the architecture Braiding." Final renunciation of rigid polymers feels compelled by prior observations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to CR closure in return with "plan that would change the plant," cost legible in "lawsuits and scorn." Orientation anchored early in ravine arrival; single scene tightens meaningfully via foam insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ravine and chrysalis constrain choices (hours watching, palm test) and charge final image between pages; sensory details (foam patterns, damp boots) filtered through symphonic bias, evolving with insight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement via connection) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through foam cadence to design; agency in sustained attention forecloses rigid path, cost felt in past harm and future scorn charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mending via braiding emerges organically from river/polymer images, resonant CR in "river would still carry my design" reweights divergence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in symphonic diction ("water speaks in motifs") modulates rhythmically with insight; stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; figurative braiding motif coherent without muddle, though minor density in reflective beats slightly dulls peak rhythm at foam tracing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer orchestration and river braiding transforms redemption trope; risk in lyric accumulative form heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via chrysalis hinge.</comment>
