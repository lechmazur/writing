<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to find beauty in incomplete drives all micro-choices, embodied in tending the lily pad and kite loss; boy's grief reveals through "wind inside him," earning relational shift. Final tethering to "new listening" shows earned stasis with cost of unrecovered kite. Contradictory impulses harmonize discord on-page, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: kite snap breaks hush-pattern, building density to raft's drift as Charged Poise reconfiguration, reweighting loss with "song... richer in the torn places." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in foreclosed retrieval.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Damp sand constrains writing loops; lagoon enables raft float toward kite, charging closure image. Recurring glints/reeds filter through poet's perceptual bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Environment shapes final "meet it halfway," satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of beauty-in-incomplete signaled early, tightens via snap to poet's attentive intervention and raft, narrowing to acceptance over fix. Agency in "tend the torn" forecloses retrieval with felt cost in boy's lightened spool. Textural escalation peaks coherently at "not by hiding it," legible under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of discord-as-harbor emerges from kite snap, feather-ribbon pen, raft; final kite as "bright fish... writing the long sentence of sky" reweights premise non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in "incompletions" lingers with emotional honesty, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Poetic voice distinct in syntax/rhythm ("seams show, to listen for loosened threads"), modulates with pressure post-snap; boy's dialogue contrasts simply ("My kite"). Stable focalization through poet's glint-attuned perception; elision of kite retrieval paid in resonant image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors cohere in woven pattern ("hues braided from mistakes") without muddle, propelling to closure. No loops/scaffolds; figurative language pattern-taught early, enhancing poetic propulsion. Final line recharges motifs cleanly, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of loss into "woven dawns" via feather-raft; transforms mentor trope through textural art-making. Risky lyric compression feels inevitable in "kite becomes one more cloud with a handle," heightening stakes organically, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
