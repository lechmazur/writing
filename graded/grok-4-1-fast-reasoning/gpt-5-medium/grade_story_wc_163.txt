<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Landscape astrologer's interiority particularized through ridge/trench metaphors translating to city floor; motivation to belong without pretending drives sync and engine dialogue with earned change in "maps were not destinations but companions." Rin applies subtle pressure via touch and rewiring, revealing hierarchy of values in micro-choices. Minor diagnostic epiphany phrasing at close slightly undercuts contradiction in impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from entry to sync exhale ("timing slid into our bones") to archive sigh, culminating in CR closure: "belonging is a rhythm you listen for until you can hum it back without fear," reweighting premise with patience cost legible in sunrise unlatched doors. Orientation anchored early in arrival and hatch; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via rip tides/sunrise clock and corroded ports, with dome fish "whirled like punctuation" charging final rest image; sensory hierarchy (silt constellations, plankton fireflies) filtered through astrologer bias. Data garden glass fronds and murals guide path purposefully. Micro-setting (grating curl) mirrors internal sync.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rhythm of belonging) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via exhale reversal on sentinel then engine query, narrowing to renunciation of pretending with cost in patient sync ("tide clocks cupped in our ribs"). Agency in feather use and truthful answer forces crystallization; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sync pulses and archive lights slowing to match bodies, resonant CR in "sunrise had tasted like a threat; afterward... consent" reweighting belonging without literal moral. Subtext in shared exhale and Rin's ingenuity enriches complexity. No tidy binary; ambiguity in city's conditional welcome lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ridgelines and trenches the way others thread stars"; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short exhales to dome rest). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("what we sought that could not wait"); first-person stable, no elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "feather... charred spine served as conductor"); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax propels from entry tremor to pulsing floor. Figurative consistent in lyric mode, taught early ("constellations of silt"); zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrologer reading drowned city as sky, feather as ash-storm key unlocking breathing algorithms; risk in poetic underwater lyric pays off in belonging CR without gimmick. No template echoes; particulars like kelp-copper rewiring transform tropes organically.</comment>
