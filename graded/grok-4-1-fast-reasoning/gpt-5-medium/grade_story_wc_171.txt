<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's operatively gentle trait drives micro-choices like letting argument exhaust before speaking on shared work redemption, earning final lighter departure with visible patience cost; secondary characters (soldier, general) apply crucible pressure via refusal/redraft; minor reflective summaries don't flatten peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds from offerings/arguments to Charged Poise closure in bowl-sharing/promise under stars, with patience-debt cost legible in "terrace forgives nothing, but remembers patience"; single scene oriented early; one tightening via children's input softens delegates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cracked terrace stones/fennel constrain patience choice and charge final child-tracing image; selective sensory (banners sigh wind, lemon water caution) mirrors ritual softening; micro-setting (casings bowl) evolves causally to witness, biasing through narrator's gentle priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor ideals amid war) signaled early tightens accumulatively via redemption debate/general's shaking redraft, forcing trade-off endurance; agency in ritual facilitation forecloses violence path with felt cost ("victories that returned as funerals," enemies' sleep judgment).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via shared work/ritual emerges organically from casings-to-witness shift and breathing draft; final sea-facing bowl offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior grief without moralizing; subtext in silences/images avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (celestial timing in pulse, gentleness heavier than steel); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (soldier/she redemption exchange pursues goals); rhythmic modulation builds to charged dusk lanterns/ moon lift without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm (sentence variety, no loops); minor figurative density ("promises bristled and broke") coherent/voice-motivated, pays off in closure breathing; occasional paraphrase (ritual significance repeat) doesn't obscure cause/effect or dull bowl image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh lyric-ritual synthesis transforms war-negotiation trope via operatively gentle operatives and casings bouquet; risk-taking in accumulative celestial/terrestrial dance heightens stakes coherently; final child-cracks path inevitable from flawed beauty particulars.</comment>
