<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to create indirect art from trauma feels rooted in consistent traits and intensifies through mother's nod and wrist-squeeze; interiority concrete in "porcelain cracks in her eyes" and embodied contradictions in handling secrets without confession. Final endurance of unflinching truth earns change with relational cost. Minor abstraction in epiphanies avoids full 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from home preparation to gallery via ash-scattering and visitor reactions, tightening to chair's self-rocking under skylight. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "the chair slows itself" with felt cost of witnessed survival. Orientation anchored early in house/kit/mother; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring rocking chair and skylight constrain final image, charging closure; sensory details like "house exhales dust" and "paper dust, a smell like singed sugar" filter through artist's bias. Spatial choreography clear from hall to studio to gallery rooms. Environment mirrors internal hush effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honest art via incomplete info signaled early, tightens accumulatively through visitor tremors and chair's rhythm resuming pressure. Agency in scattering ash and installing chair forecloses direct confession path with cost of ambiguity. One deepening suffices; minor abstract stakes slightly tempers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mirage of safety emerges organically from ash-faces, mask seams, and chair's hush, reweighting via "danger cannot bear to be named outright." Final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Counter-readings in visitor ghosts add complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with perceptual signature in "light catching along its fault lines like tiny rivers"; stable first-person, minimal dialogue natural ("Take what you need"). Rhythm modulates with intensity; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in ash-mixing beats; metaphors coherent like kintsugi without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in chair-rocking bookends and repetitive "slows to a stop" ding rhythm slightly, but purposeful pattern avoids heavy artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma-art via powdered letters, self-rocking chair, and visitor-led ambiguity transforms family-secrets trope organically. Risky lyric frame heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight in gallery exhale.</comment>
