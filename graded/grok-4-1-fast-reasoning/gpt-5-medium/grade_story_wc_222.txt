<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied tremors ("hands trembled," "gloves shook") and contradictory impulses (cautious abandon) compel swaps; final promise swap earns change with visible cost in trembling certainty. Flaw of thievery complicates mercy-tied choices organically. Minor abstraction in "braid of penance and play" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: swaps build density of revelations, culminating in RR closure as board inhales wrongness with cost (trembling certainty, locked corridor). Orientation anchors early ("icebound spire...sky is wrong"); pattern taught via first pawn, paid in queen swap. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via heart notch, chessboard whispers, cold that "forgot how to bite"; recurring pocket sundial lid charges final light-throw to bell. Sensory hierarchy (frost breath, blue lamps leaning) mirrors POV wonder. Final dripping temperature evolves causally, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend dissonant weather via swaps) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening revelations (pawn vow, rook storm-map, queen letter), narrowing to moral calculus at "trembling certainty." Agency in swaps forecloses theft-path with promise-cost. Minor abstractness in "people meant promises" doesn't dull peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending via wonder/play emerges implicitly from swaps reweighting secrets to mercy; final image ("mountains, late but apologizing") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Queen's letter to unborn self ties arc to embracing unknown. Counter-reading lingers in thief's enduring flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("learn by listening to astonishment," synesthetic "rain on iron") modulates with pressure; stable POV, no leakage. Teacher's dialogue natural/subtextual ("You stole nothing"), distinct idiom. Rhythmic control peaks in swap beats without compression loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("The board shivered, approving"); rhythm varies, no loops. Minor overwrite in repetitive promise phrasing across swaps (−0.4), but pattern-taught and voice-motivated; closure image clear ("chessboard inhaled"). Zero scaffold in peak queen moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess-weather-magic with thief-swaps transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via irreplaceable spire-board logic. Final reconfiguration ("play like prayer") inevitable from particulars. No derivatives.</comment>
