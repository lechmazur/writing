<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via fingertip on arrowhead burr and trembling cord, revealing reverent patience under pressure; micro-choices like tying arrowhead align with motivation to navigate still. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak beats slightly limits depth, but change to internal map is earned with felt cost of leaving stones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rhythmic density buildup from hum to birds to pulse; single continuous scene anchored early in canyon. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly in "the map inside me has redrawn the world," with conceptual cost of empty cord legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Towers of bone and shale pools constrain patience on ledge and charge echoes as tuning forks; black mirror reflects sky while arrowhead fall strikes exact rib, mirroring internal shift. Sensory selection (wingbeats as ripples) purposeful and POV-biased toward harmonic patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hear wandering pulse signaled early tightens texturally via birds' patterns deepening to canyon shift, narrowing to stillness with agency in breath-tuning. Cost unmistakable in arrowhead cast and stones left, charging Charged Poise; minor abstractness in pulse detection prevents higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of navigating by resonance emerges organically from particulars like bird grammar and bone chorus, reweighted non-literally in final empty cord image answering "hold still, and the world will carry you." No moralizing; ambiguity in pulse's pretense lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in harmonic phrasing like "trimmed silence itself"; rhythmic control modulates from weathered resolve to settled travel. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in legible closure without head-hopping or elision friction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like birds braiding into day advancing sound-map; rhythm varies naturally, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion. Minor figurative density in peak ("distances fold like paper boats") coherent in lyric pattern without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone-skipping harmonics and bird-pattern navigation transforms listening trope into bold, risk-taking stillness-travel; pulse's evasion feels inevitable from bone towers. Irreplaceable premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
