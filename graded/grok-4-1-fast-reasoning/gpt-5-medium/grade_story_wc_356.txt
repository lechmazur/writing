<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in planting despite village fear ("ambition twists the nose and the village"), embodied via scent sensitivity; final softening of ambition to stewardship earned with felt cost of inhaling "feral and cavernous" stink. Interiority concrete and particular through olfactory mapping. No unearned epiphanies or tidy paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from seed's "remembered grief" to bloom's "truths with teeth," culminating in Charged Poise closure where stink steadies bridges and arranges choices. On-page cost legible in "inhaled until my eyes watered." Orientation anchored early in treetop village; one tightening via bloom suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Treetop specifics (swaying boards, trembling ropes) constrain planting at "bridge's heart" and charge final steadied image; olfactory hierarchy shapes perception amid crisis. Sensory selection purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Body as micro-setting via scent embodiment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity in motion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bloom's stink forcing collective inhale; agency in guiding with "slow drums," cost unmistakable in flinched village and narrator's watering eyes. Protagonist endurance forecloses fear-path with on-page equilibrium thrum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rot-to-balance emerges organically from corpse flower's "road back," resonant non-literal answer in final "map of breath" reweighting ambition. Complexity embraced via villagers' fear without tidy moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via scent "currents" and spirals; rhythmic prose modulates with bloom's intensity. Stable first-person focalization, biased noticing character-specific. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., doodles as maps/recipes); varied rhythm passes ear test. Figurative language consistent and voice-motivated ("storm sap," "leaf-tied chimes"), no muddle or loops obscuring closure. Minor scaffold in repeated "journalize" but no propulsion loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of treetop olfactory world and corpse flower for equilibrium; corpse bloom's "perfumes the way home" turn inevitable from herbalist traits. Bold risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative templates.</comment>
