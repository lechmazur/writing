<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Defunct revolutionary's poetic bias drives micro-choices like temple-pressing the shard and council performance, earning stasis in defunct revolution despite victory; contradictory hunger for proof vs. longing shown in embodied hesitation during translation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shard discovery accumulates to council demo CR, where "we made... equal" reconfigures archive with sorrow cost at shard's crack; orientation anchored early in asteroid intro, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's cornices and time-veils constrain via storm-squalls enabling shard song; mirrors as recurring micro-setting force covering ritual, charging council rostrum climax and final sorrow image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake to reimagine civilization tightens accumulatively via Ledger petition to public readings, forcing council agency; cost legible in muffled Ledger laughter and shard crack foreclosing perfect proof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ornament-as-solidarity emerges implicitly via shard breaths and "curve upon curve of gathered breath," reweighted non-literally in final "sorrow shone, burnished" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature ("gilt dust, spinning in drafts") biases to breath/song, modulating rhythm with storm intensity; Ledger's sparse dialogue distinct in mocking graphs vs. narrator's cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("years drizzled in like smoke"); no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence peaks clean in "thousand extinct hands working together" at council without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Time-visible asteroid and singing shard synthesize fresh sci-fi lyricism, risking poetic compression that inevitability charges CR; bold mirrors ritual transforms archaeological trope organically.</comment>
