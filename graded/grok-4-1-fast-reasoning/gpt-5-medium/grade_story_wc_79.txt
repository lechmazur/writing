<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via pause at crack ("No voice calls me") and final choice to step forward earned by mother's tag/ledger causality with visible cost of isolation. Interiority concrete through pattern-biased perception; no unearned epiphanies. Quietly driven trait constrains retreat effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of patterns/discoveries (tag, ledger, watchers' turn) tightens to Conceptual Repricing closure in "step into the corridor of glare" with undeniable conceptual cost of becoming measured. Orientation anchored early in city/turtles; no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Turtle shells constrain choices (crack under heel reveals tag) and charge final image ("turtles keep their vast time"); reed whistle as tool shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects cartographer bias toward patterns; vivid yet selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (question watchers/mother's fate) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ledger reading that forces agency (third whistle note, step forward) narrowing options with legible cost in shimmer of thinned silence. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of measurement vs. mercy emerges organically from particulars (watchers' spacing, lattice), resonant CR in corridor absence reweights premise without moral; ambiguity lingers in obligation's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spiral/pattern noticing ("barnacle constellations"); rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short sentences at crack). Stable single POV, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "crack blossoms into a hollow" advances plot/foreshadows); no loops, varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak (watchers turn). Propulsion intact to closure bell-ring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of turtle-city, pattern languages, watchers as measures feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable world logic without gimmickry.</comment>
