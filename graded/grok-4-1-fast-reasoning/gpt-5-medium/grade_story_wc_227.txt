<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory doubt and promise compel micro-choices like dunking for clarity and narrating aloud; final sharpened hope earned through engine's partial truth. Interiority particular via salted hands and leaden promise; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of measurements and fittings builds to engine's eclipse and bells' grammar, reconfiguring loss into bearable pattern with felt cost of "nearest thing to truth." Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea gnaws pontoons and fumes sting air, constraining work via cistern plunges; statue's pockmarks charge final glowing image, mirroring internal mending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conjuring meaning via engine tightens accumulatively through charm's fitting, narrowing to endurance of absence; cost legible in "does not give me her, but... pattern," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mending fractures via kintsugi and engine reweights loss into "sharpened hope," emerging organically from gold seams and statue glow without moralizing; final charm swing offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mechanical-alchemical diction ("gears-and-cogs," "solvents to... wrists"); stable first-person filters all via biased noticing; rhythm modulates with stress in short plunge beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures like "bubbles... brief as inventions"; no loops or scaffolds, rhythm varies (short plunges vs. flowing builds); propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acid-sea steampunk and memory engine via pockmark choreography transforms grief tropes; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
