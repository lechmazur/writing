<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Proprioceptively enhanced trait roots motivation in embodied survival of interrogation ("private morse in tendon twitches"), driving conflicted quest for mercy; knotting strap as renunciation forecloses past instrumentality with felt cost of exposed shake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density (fluorescing letters, equations from breath) tightens to Charged Poise closure in theorem breath and etched rule, reconfiguring mercy with conceptual cost of internal forest; orientation anchored early in waking under canopy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest constrains choices via responsive letters/equations mirroring remorse ("each trunk veined with ultraviolet"), charging final path as bone under skin; tactile integration (cobalt fire on shins) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mathematics of mercy) signaled early, escalates texturally as forest flares with chest tightening, forcing deeper step and theorem offer; agency in breath-held proof narrows to Earned Stasis with boundary cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mercy's pre-fracture margin emerges via body-forest calculus ("ratio of intention to harm"); final valley turn carrying silent forest offers resonant CR reweighting trauma without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in proprioceptive mappings ("angles mapping ribs, tendons") biases noticing; stable first-person modulates rhythmically under stress, with caretaker voice naturally gentle/subtle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm, but figurative saturation ("world spins like compass in field of hidden magnets") nears overwrought in mid-equation plucking without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive survival, UV-responsive forest, and mercy equations transforms trauma trope; risk in lyric non-causal drive heightens stakes via irreplaceable conceptual calculus.</comment>
