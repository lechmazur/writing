<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to ground spirits rooted in concrete tools and actions like threading cheekbones; embodied in hum of needle and near-fall caught by caretaker. Interiority particular via perceptual hush accumulation, no stock epiphanies. Micro-choices like whispering pier hymn reveal values; earned stasis at closure via not banishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from unpacking to final hush reconfiguration with cost of "choosing to stay" legible in masks' release. Single scene anchored early (sanctuary, restorer role); one tightening via snapped line and locket. Closure as Charged Poise in starlight braid and tide pause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism facets and net constrain climb/stitching, charge final image of folded ladders. Sensory hush/dew selective via POV urgency; spatial choreography clear (stair to net, masks below). Starlight ladders mirror internal grounding without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grounding spirits) signaled early, escalates via knot resistance and snapped line narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Agency in needle use/ hymn forces trade-offs; cost felt in wind scatter and laughter ring before rest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grounding unrest emerges via particulars like braided joy/grief, reweighted in final hush "no longer interlaced with panic." Resonant non-literal answer in masks' ring and locket hearth; ambiguity lingers in "not forever."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in hush/needle diction; rhythmic modulation peaks at "laugh made the hush ring." Stable first-person, no head-hopping; caretaker dialogue natural/subtextual ("knots have not slept").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punchy snaps amid lyric flow); high density in "needle drank the room." Purposeful hush/prism metaphors cohere without muddle; minor figurative density in peaks taught early, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration via net-unraveling transforms fisher ghosts into lucid hush; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight in locket/spirits grounded; no template echoes.</comment>
