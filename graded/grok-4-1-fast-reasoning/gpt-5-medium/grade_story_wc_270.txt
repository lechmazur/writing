<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Lida's respect for tradition clashing with solo vault descent; final vine-braid of futures earned by embodied palm-touch and knee-memory, foreclosing council stasis with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reed whispers and kite discovery layer to unseal RR closure; council refusal tightens to dusk solo act with felt defiance cost in "warm stone sang... knees to memory."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hot springs constrain ritual ("mirrored steam," "hottest pool" vault) and charge seedling rooting; porous rock and sulfur wind evolve tactilely, mirroring intent without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve vs preserve) signaled early, deepens via refusal forcing unseal agency; cost unmistakable in groundmind gathering her "declared map," charging council confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chosen intent vs implanted destiny emerges via vine tasting air and trellis evolution; final trunk scaffold reweights tradition non-literally, lingering without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in plant-shivers and syllable-mince; rhythmic compression peaks at unseal ("amber softened like honey"), stable third-limited with collective "we" converging intentionally at Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dense propulsion in reed-strategy to spring-flare; minor metaphor density ("nails hummed," "wet loaf") purposeful in lyric mode but borders overwrite at climax, not dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant-telepathy, kite-code unseal transforms destiny trope; risk in poetic world-logic (groundmind map) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via reed chorus.</comment>
