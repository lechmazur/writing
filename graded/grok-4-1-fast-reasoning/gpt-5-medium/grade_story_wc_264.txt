<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to cultivate sparks drives consistent micro-choices like humming and pacing, with embodied sensations (knuckles brushed by drafts) revealing endurance under pressure. Interiority particular through dreamless state and signalman lore, earning final integration ("sometimes I am occasionally everywhere"). No contradictory impulses shown in scene, but endurance forecloses dreamless isolation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from humming ripples to spore planting, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("the train learns to be a greenhouse") with conceptual cost of persistent ruin endurance. Orientation anchored early ("rail glitters like a vein across the glowing dune"). Single continuous scene fits defaults; pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glowing dunes constrain and respond (sing when wind finds throats, plant quiet in boots), charging final image where spores travel on rails as soil. Sensory hierarchy (cold fire blooms, glassy throats) filtered through guard's perceptual bias. Micro-setting (crate drafts, axles) guides choices like brake-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake ( coax archive vs. erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via charm replies (images spill, clock ticks), narrowing to spore dispersal with agency-driven cost (pacing recitals, not looking too soon). Final train-as-greenhouse reweights with undeniable endurance price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-from-ruin emerges organically via archive tendencies ("seeds learning to be embers") and final reconfiguration, offering non-literal answer (stitched morning) without moralizing. Recurring images (sparks, lanterns) shift from potential to realized without token recurrence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spines of memory blinking," "wave functions") biases noticing toward quantum-lullaby synesthesia, with rhythmic modulation under pressure (short whispers to sprawling pacing). Stable first-person; purposeful compression legible in lyric mode, paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "notes scatter like pebbles in water, watching ripples fold"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("lantern spores, as soft as lungs") purposeful and coherent, not muddling peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh post-ruin synthesis of freight archive, quantum lullabies, and spore-greenhouse transforms tropes into inevitable perceptual logic. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes (erasure match), with final "stitched together morning" feeling earned and singular.</comment>
