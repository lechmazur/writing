<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to prove whispers over shouts roots in concrete traits like grandmother's vial and beekeeper's method, driving micro-choices like steeping petals. Embodied emotions shine in "breath steadies and loses its need to be right," but minor over-articulation of philosophy slightly abstracts internal conflict. Mentor's silent belief earns the relational shift without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds whispering pattern to RR closure in freighter's salute and mentor's exhale, reconfiguring shout-vs-whisper premise with patience cost legible in "warm with my patience." Orientation anchors instantly at cobalt lighthouse dawn; single scene fits defaults perfectly. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "rails smell of salt, iron, and the old quarrels of gulls" filter through POV urgency, constraining choices (lantern sweat as "small ear," gallery for beckoning). Recurring vial charges final tuck-in image. Micro-setting (vial, lantern) evolves causally, mirroring tenderness without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers travel farther) signaled early, escalates via scent method under accumulative lens—one decisive deepening as freighter "slides toward the channel," narrowing shout option with humility cost in captain's muffled horn. Agency in "pinch the vial cork... and hum" forecloses brute force path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of tenderness over thunder emerges from particulars like vial-purified breath and scent compass, culminating in non-literal CR: "forgiveness borrow my tongue" reweights premise as freighter salutes. Resonant without moralizing; captain's prior shout mirrors and inverts for earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lantern glass sweats with dew, and each drop is a small ear") biases toward subtle vibrations, modulating rhythmically under pressure—no head-hopping, stable first-person distance. Sparse dialogue ("Do you believe me now") carries subtext via mentor's silence, advancing belief shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short hum sentences accelerate; longer images breathe), high density in "scent walk into the wind." Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("prayer wheel," "map I refuse to draw") during peak risks coherence, but intentional lyric pattern teaches early without obscuring freighter turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: beekeeper trumpet and night-garden scent transform lighthouse trope into "soft compass" for ships, risking bold lyric mode that heightens stakes via irreplaceable vial. Final "gentle map of breath" feels inevitable, no derivative echoes.</comment>
