<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to map scars intensifies through embodied actions like pressing the timer and tracing the chart, earning a credible endurance of personal wounds; caretaker applies relevant pressure via revelations. Internal conflict subtle in contradictory clarity that sharpens fear's edge, shown without alternating summaries. Minor weakness: lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in a pivotal beat like the final scar alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as storm images and timer beats build density toward Charged Poise closure in scar-path alignment and "language into a map that breathed," with felt cost of confronted personal/city wounds legible in the echoing courage. Orientation anchored early via envelope and climb. Single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory dome, brass switchboard, and storm constrain timing choices via flashes and thunderclaps, charging the final "healed page drying" image. Sensory details like rarefied air and flickering bolts filter through poet's priorities, vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography clear in railing, chart, photo interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of scar cartography signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timer presses, photo reveal, and scar-tracing tightening that narrows denial options with visible endurance cost. Caretaker's guidance complicates but poet's agency in timing and poem-speaking drives. Cost unmistakable in "courage would echo," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars as navigable maps emerges organically from timer vigil, ash constellation, and chart alignment, culminating in resonant final image reweighting pain as "merciful" and "healed page" without moralizing. Subtext in silences and pauses invites ambiguity on forgiveness. Protagonist arc inextricable from refusing wounds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature in storm-as-atlas and scar-ink images, with rhythmic control modulating from hush to thunderclaps; single POV stable, no head-hopping. Dialogue natural/subtextual, e.g., caretaker's "masks slip" advances revelation. Diction biased toward cartographic wonder, consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "thumb hovering over its chrome button as if above a pulse"; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor artifact in "furiously tranquil" triple repeat without full pattern payoff dulls one peak beat slightly. No loops, muddled metaphors, or scaffold; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lightning-scars as censored poem's map transforms trope of personal healing into storm-vigil cartography, with bold lyric risks heightening stakes via ash-constellation payoff. No derivative echoes; premise commits to weather-ink logic fully.</comment>
