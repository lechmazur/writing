<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied actions like matching breath to watch's stutter and pulse-measuring pauses, revealing contradictory cautious joy; earned change to messenger via patience costs a prior lie and hurried path. Minor abstraction in traits slightly mutes specificity under peak decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from watch cipher to breath-written letter; closure as Charged Poise in "watch clicked, satisfied" reconfigures with conceptual cost of smoke witness and foreclosed speech. Orientation anchored early in veiled dreamer journey; one tightening via door's patience demand suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and library constrain choices—windows breathe back at pauses, shelves ripple to heartbeats—charging final image of intervals carrying library. Sensory selection (fogged page clearing to letters) purposeful and POV-biased toward delays; micro-setting via watch body integrates tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find unspoken library tightens via patience-for-door and breath costs, narrowing to endurance agency; under Accumulative lens, density cadence shift reweights with dew-heavy syllables falling. Escalation driven by micro-choices like screw-turns foreclosing hurry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken speech via delay emerges organically from watch ciphers, breath fog on page, and final echo-promise; resonant non-literal answer in library receding yet traveling "in intervals and patience" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature on delays ("speech between ticks") and rhythmic modulation under stress; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. Voice reflects mind's hopeful caution without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring stuttered time; no loops or scaffolds, figurative coherence in spirals/mist without muddle in peaks like page-fogging. Rhythmic ear-test passes with natural paragraph cadences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reversed-time watch decoding unspoken library transforms dream tropes via breath mechanics and delay stakes; bold lyric risk heightens closure charge without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
