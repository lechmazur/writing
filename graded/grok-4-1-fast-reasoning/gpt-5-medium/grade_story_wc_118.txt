<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Historian's porous interiority embodied in "letting other lives flow through, like wind through an unlatched gate" shows contradictory serenity amid absorption, compelling the earned volunteer stance at closure with visible cost of self-loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (diaries, disk) build density to CR closure: whispering "steady now" reconfigures axis premise with conceptual cost of dreamless world's echoes needing testimony, legible in final pulse image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silo's "ladder rungs and binding twine" shelves and "groan of bolts" constrain probing/rearranging choices; dragon fragment and disk as micro-settings charge final image, filtered through perceptual bias of wall-listening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collecting wall-stories tightens via disk discovery narrowing options to endurance as absorber; agency in rearranging forecloses old order with felt porous cost, charged in closing pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of testimony in silence emerges from particulars like stitched dragon and axis-whisper, offering non-literal answer in final "stitch a world from echoes" that reweights dream-loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("listener to brick tone") and rhythmic control ("dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year") heighten lyrical pressure, elisions taught early and paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in "He touches the dragon fragment and dust flurries"; varied rhythm, zero loops, purposeful figures integrate without muddle, even in peak discoveries.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream silos/wall-stories as displaced axis myth risks bold lyricism, transforming apocalypse tropes via historian's ear; closure pulse feels inevitable from seeded particulars.</comment>
