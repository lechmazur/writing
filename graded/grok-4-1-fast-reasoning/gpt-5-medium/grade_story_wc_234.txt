<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scientifically romantic trait compels inventory of variables despite doubt, earning shared proof with embodied cost in shoulders loosening into structure; contradictory impulses act in calibration scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to CR closure in thimble of light reweighting presence; circling thrice tightens with felt cost, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nautilus curl and anvil stone constrain choices in experiment, charging final image of revalued steps; forge trees' sparks mirror internal calibration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture presence deepens texturally via circling returns narrowing to core pause; cost legible in "presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of repeatable wonder emerges via particulars like pocket sun's clicks, resonant in final promise without moralizing; reweights "love" as experiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Collective "we" POV stable with perceptual signature in juniper-tasting whispers; rhythmic control heightens during phosphorus chord strike.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "natural logarithm grown in salt," but minor figurative density in circling beat risks slight overwrite; no loops, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical science in ember nexus transforms intangible capture; risk of poetic compression pays off in charged poise closure.</comment>
