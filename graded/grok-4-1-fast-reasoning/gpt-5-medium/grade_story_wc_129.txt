<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority via "luminescent ache I could not name" and "boldly sympathetic" trait shown through reed sculptures responding to chalk, compelling community graft; final dedication earned via search causality. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak scene slightly tempers from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of whispers, people, and postures builds to RR closure in "arbor knew its shape from the bodies, and then it held"; cost legible in persistent "ache... now it glowed like a lantern meant for many hands." Orientation anchored early in orchard/crater; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and crater shards constrain search/permissions and charge final arbor image ("orchard accepted by chiming; the crater accepted by quieting"); sensory details like "humming nets of light" and "stardust sugar" selectively bias via sculptor's perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting via arbor rebuild tightens accumulatively through shared search finding tag-as-posture, drawing ring of bodies; agency in reed sculptures and leaning forces trade-off, cost felt in enduring ache. Single decisive density intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal "leaning together" emerges organically from search particulars, reweighted in final image of "ribs to ribs" arbor holding without stated moral; resonant non-literal answer to lost-language isolation via recovered posture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable with perceptual signature ("echo a people I barely knew"); diction/rhythm modulate poetically ("pivot points touching at the ribs") without head-hopping; elisions taught early, paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation; images like "singing bowl" propel without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("mineral sigh," "humming nets") during setup slightly dulls early propulsion, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystalline orchard/tag-as-posture transforms community trope via sculptor's graft; risk in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "posture we could adopt."</comment>
