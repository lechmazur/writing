<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exemplary concrete interiority via dust patterns and gravity-reading; internal conflict peaks in "duty and curiosity pulled different ways," compelling the unwind choice with felt cost of carrying the barrel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered discoveries tightening to RR closure; dust-to-barrel-to-unwind sequence narrows options with legible cost in "hush slid down from the ceiling like silk let go."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ceiling grid and dust constrain climbs and revelations, charging final image where "dust lift, swirl, and settle in a new arrangement"; POV-biased sensory hierarchy (smells of coins/roses, mouse paths) integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover ceiling secrets/release ghosts) deepens via payroll revelation under textural lens; protagonist agency in backward winding forces trade-off, with cost unmistakable in room's inhale and ledger's self-opening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stolen time/debts emerges organically from mainspring payroll and unwind; final ledger-crossing image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting "borrowed days" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "gravity prints its diary everywhere"; rhythmic control modulates from anticipatory whispers to release hush, with stable first-person intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, but figurative density peaks slightly heavy in climax ("ribbon ledger... chorus of afternoons"); no loops, strong read-aloud rhythm sustains momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ghosts pooling in ceiling grids and time-theft via mainsprings transform supernatural tropes ingeniously; risk-taking voice synthesizes repairman's observation into inevitable release, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
