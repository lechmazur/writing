<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via cloud-emotion taxonomy and father's scented absence; motivation to prove empty spaces remember drives micro-choices like threading emotional coordinates, with earned endurance in logging blanks. Minor slip in embodied contradiction—impulses sequential rather than simultaneous in pivotal radio beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observational density builds to CR closure in blank log lines reweighting absence as proof, with felt cost in unwritable spaces; orientation anchors immediately in gondola drift. No slips touching final image of spooled reunion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Telescope as micro-setting constrains choices (starlight charting) and charges final cradle placement; sensory hierarchy (smell of oil/cinnamon, rustling balloon) reflects POV bias, evolving with squall forgiveness. Integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving memory tightens via radio hail and cloud-mood deepening (resentment to gratitude), narrowing to emotional bearings with agency in swing adjustments; cost legible in drift's echoing hoofprints. Single decisive intensification suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memorialized absence emerges organically from cloud readings and blanks, with final log image offering non-literal repricing of premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and scents layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (sky as diary/city of feelings) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in "meadow of silence," stable first-person distance with radio naturalism advancing plot. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "squall line creeps like a librarian"); varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful metaphors coherent in lyric mode without muddle in closure beat. Minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional meteorology transforms lost-balloon trope, with risk-taking in lyric voice yielding inevitable hindsight payoff in proof-by-blanks; bold premise fully committed.</comment>
