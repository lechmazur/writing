<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses ("bruised awe... constant tide against my sternum"; filing tooth "gentler, filing my pulse gentler too") compel the endurance at closure, with "beautifully flawed" as a constraining trait enabling mercy calculus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from routine tuning to needle leaning and mechanism trembling; Charged Poise closure lands in singing the lullaby and resting hand on machine, with cost legible in "waited with it" endurance image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hush pane and puppet head as micro-settings constrain choices (breath against pane; puppet's counsel) and charge final image; sensory hush integrates purposefully, mirroring internal shelter without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of delaying doom tightens accumulatively via bent tooth, leaning needle, and world pressures ("politics learned its favorite thunder"); agency in winding springs and singing forecloses failure path with felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of flawed mercy emerges organically through lullaby motif shifting from mother's porch to global vow; final beam turning reconfigures hush-as-shelter without moralizing, reweighting prior fractures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears nested within gears, a cathedral of time") and rhythmic modulation under pressure sustain single tight first-person POV; purposeful compression teaches lyric pattern paid off in closure song.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied syntax propelling from "sky browned early" escalation to "each note was a stitch"; figurative language coherent and pattern-taught in hush/ocean motifs without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms doomsday trope into poetic caretaker vow via hush pane and puppet witness; fresh synthesis of clock-as-ocean mercy feels inevitable, with lyric risk heightening stakes cleanly.</comment>
