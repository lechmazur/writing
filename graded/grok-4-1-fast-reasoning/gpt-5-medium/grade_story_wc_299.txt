<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between factual insulation and memory's pull act in the scrap-handling scene; final pricing choice earned by radio failure parallel and embodied hand-knowledge, foreclosing detachment with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density building to CR closure; "Item carries memory load disproportionate to market" reconfigures facts-vs-grief premise with conceptual cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry trailer and pit constrain reflection-isolation, charging final "echo valley longing made visible" image; sensory details (rock dust, heater ticking) filter through roadie POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of insulation vs. grief deepens accumulatively via scrap recognition, narrowing to pricing trade-off; cost unmistakable in "fingers...asked permission to believe."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final pricing image offers resonant answer to facts-vs-echo question, reweighting premise via "keep a rock...for echo" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses music/quarry echoes ("applause sloshed off shale"); stable first-person distance modulates rhythm under reflective pressure, dialogue sparse but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Purposeful lyrical metaphors (e.g., "rusted thought," echo motifs) build density without muddle or loops; propulsion intact, minor figurative density serves voice but risks slight coherence in opener.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry-concert relic appraisal synthesizes loss/echo freshly; risk-taking in sustained metaphor transforms trope into inevitable "memory load" reconfiguration.</comment>
