<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Analytical performer's contradictory impulses—calculated orchestration vs. gentle yielding—act simultaneously in the bishop-janitor interaction, earning the final curation of serendipity with relational cost to the janitor's grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through orchestrated interactions to Charged Poise closure in "the interlude did the truer work," reconfiguring rehearsal with conceptual cost of curated impermanence; orientation anchored early, one tightening via janitor's revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal arcade's puddle reflections and eroding chalk constrain bishop-skim choice and charge final image of "chalk lines into confetti that refuses to drown," with sensory bias toward probabilities and diagonals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrating serendipity deepens accumulatively through janitor's grief pressure, narrowing to stance crystallization in bishop return; agency in planting questions and skimming piece shows trade-off cost in tidal erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sideways grief and rehearsed luck emerges organically, resonant non-literal answer in final "chance and care hold hands," reweighting motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied syntax/rhythm; purposeful lyrical metaphors cohere without muddle or loops, even in peak bishop beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess diagonals, tidal chaos, and grief orchestration feels inevitable; bold lyric risks heighten stakes in bishop skim without gimmickry.</comment>
