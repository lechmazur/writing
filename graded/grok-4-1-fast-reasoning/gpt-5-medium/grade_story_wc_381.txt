<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's micro-choices (placing wing, tracing ripples, whispering breath) reveal values under pressure, earning the endurance at "the code untied like wet shoelaces." Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied calm ("lantern of calm opened and burned without smoke"). Subtle contradiction in facing balking code, but lacks simultaneous impulses acting in peak beat for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wing placement to ripple mapping, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "the future exhaled and tried again," with felt cost of patient release over erasure. Orientation anchored early ("nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook"). Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brook micro-setting constrains choices (wing on water, breath to seam) and charges final image ("bead of water like a planet"). Sensory hierarchy (hushed sound, cosmic shimmer) reflects summoner's perceptual bias. Details evolve causally ("foam rose and bowed, carrying away a letter").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush code) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at balk ("clinging to a stone like frost"), forcing deepening via breath guidance; agency in endurance forecloses forceful path. Cost legible in "careful drift between danger and mercy." One decisive intensification suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of merciful listening emerges organically from hush motifs shifting to "room; the future exhaled," reweighting prophecy without moralizing. Final image ("wing like a vow that hums") offers non-literal resonance to central question. Complexity in prophecy's stubborn fear avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice delivers distinct perceptual signature ("moonmilk," "paper thunder") modulating with intensity; POV stable in summoner's biased noticing. Rhythmic control heightens pressure (short breaths in climax). Patterned diction taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (hush, flow) propels accumulatively; no loops, scaffold, or muddle. Minor overwriting density in opening ("tranquil blaze of listening") risks slight blur, but coherence holds through peaks. Rhythm varies read-aloud, final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami summoning and silence-mapping transforms prophecy trope into inevitable "wet shoelaces" untying. Bold lyric risks (cosmic hush) heighten stakes coherently. Non-obvious moral calculus (release over erasure) feels earned in hindsight.</comment>
