<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's gentle persistence and handling of fears compel higher-stakes choices like pairing generations and facing the patrol; collective "we" shows embodied contradictions in fear/pride. Final endurance earned through prior exchanges. Contradictory impulses act in patrol standoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from donations to patrol tightening to spring CR (bell reprised, winter cost endured). Orientation anchored early in village/arbor/sanctions. Persistent secrecy constraint shapes tactics; cost legible in "held the bell without ringing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arbor as rib cage constrains choices (hides donations, patrol site) and charges final polish/hang. Sensory hierarchy (pad-soft steps, bell voice) reflects collective urgency; frost/snow evolve causally. Micro-setting (bell/broom) mirrors internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intergenerational support under raid risk) signaled early; patrol deepens via Mara's stance ("They do not exist"), narrowing options with felt cost (sharpened timing). Agency in endurance forecloses exposure path. Accumulative pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of care braiding scarcity emerges from particulars (bell rings, paired runs exchange stories); ambiguity in secrecy lingers without confusion. Final image (faces wobble in polished bell, wind rings thanks) reweights premise non-literally as conceptual cost of winter paid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person plural POV stable as collective interiority; perceptual signature in biased noticing (tides, braids, choir). Rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences in patrol); dialogue sparse but subtextual ("They do not exist"). No head-hopping; elision taught via secrecy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (rib cage, braid lifts season) without muddle in peaks. Varied rhythm, no loops; "moon tilted, and Mara held the bell without ringing" propels via image. Zero artifacts; read-aloud cadence perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions/scarcity into bell-bridged resilience; tropes (community endurance) transformed via constellations/night book. Risky plural POV/lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
