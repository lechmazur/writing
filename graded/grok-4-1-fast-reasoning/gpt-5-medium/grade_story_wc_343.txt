<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (quiet voice per captain yet diligent noting under insomnia) act in scene; final endurance as apprentice charting ahead earned by pattern-solving choices with felt glow/cost in "ribs were lantern slats."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (birds/grid/hopscotch) tightens to RR closure when light unspools after figure-eight trace, reconfiguring mission with ongoing watchfulness cost legible in final log image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hopscotch board on gondola floor constrains pivotal choice (numerals instruct steering); recurring dog-ear grid charges final "figure-eight page reference" handshake across time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to map luminance tightens accumulatively via pattern recognition forcing agency (ring bell, steer); cost in lent trust and "steam dared to revise my courage" felt before unspooling success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterns bridging isolation/language emerges organically; final log reweights premise non-literally as "language becomes motion and motion becomes light," with ambiguity of silence following route.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lyrical bias ("birds stitched questions," "gauze soaked in mint"); rhythm modulates from watchful calm to peak hum without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; figurative layering ("pearly static that hummed against my teeth") coherent and pattern-taught, no loops though minor density risks overwriting in light unspooling beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hopscotch/birds/light as navigational code transforms airship trope; risky lyric risk heightens pattern stakes, inevitable in hindsight via early dog-ear grid.</comment>
