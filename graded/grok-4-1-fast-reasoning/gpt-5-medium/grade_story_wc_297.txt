<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Root-bound visionary's curiosity drives contradictory impulses—bravery in linking scars despite warnings—and earns the final vow with embodied cost in grafts; woman's scar forces micro-choice that reveals shared vision, deepening relational crucible without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of whispers, scars, and maze growth to RR closure in braided vow and crossroads step, reconfiguring covenant with cost of unmade noon; orientation anchors in first paragraph (glade, grafting, clipping); no shards or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's hedges and pool constrain choices—path unfurls under scars, maze roots on water—charging final image; sensory bias (scent of clipped decisions, leaf-whispers) reflects POV urgency, evolving causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream intersection post-eclipse) signaled early tightens accumulatively via scar-link vision and maze-heeding, forcing agency in gardener confrontation; cost legible in foreclosed restoration, though climax leans image over visceral trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Circular oaths vs braided vows emerge organically from hedge-words and cambium-seal, with final crossroads image resonantly reweighting garden/people divide without moralizing; recurring scars/maze shift meaning through struggle, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (leaf-veins with lightning, ribbon from mouth) modulates rhythm under pressure, stable without leakage; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged poise at dusk-blur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-chains, but figurative saturation borders overwriting in climax (e.g., "grammar, teaching us how to say yes without erasing no"); no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grafted futurism, scar-maps, and sentient hedges risks bold lyricism, transforming covenant trope via cambium-record; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from clipping-seed.</comment>
