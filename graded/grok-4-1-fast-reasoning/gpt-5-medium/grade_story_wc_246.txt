<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in writing furrows amid shame ("old shame that tastes like rusted tools") act simultaneously, earning final reconfiguration with cost in unbending field; Del forces relational micro-choices without hedging competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density tightening from hiss/burst to stalk interference and retroactive seeds as CR, with conceptual cost legible in "clocks forgot which wrist they loved" and orbiting crates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quiet's gravity constrains writing ritual ("scrap tugged against the pen, resisting" amid groan/shift), charging stalk image; sensory hierarchy (hiss as rain, breathing for translation) filters via interpreter bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake deepens from cosmic crops to personal furrows via Del's editing pivot and stalk melody, narrowing guilt-options with embodied cost in "chest grew tight"; agency in pen-ritual forecloses shame path under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terraces/stalk reweights reception-vs-editing premise non-literally, emerging from bowls/ripples without moralizing; final "blanket that remembers several winters" resonates ambiguity in contingent agency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in furrowing syntax ("lines that turned inward") and modulated rhythm (slow Quiet breaths) embodies POV; Del's subtextual dialogue ("we do not receive; we edit") advances without register clash.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in "constellations as verbs and fields as nouns" propels without loops; rhythm varies with pressure, metaphors cohere (bowls ripple to treaties) sans muddle in peak writing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gravitational "editing history" via pen-stalk synthesis transforms signal trope organically, risking lyric sci-fi where "treaties hum when kin stop shouting" heightens contingent stakes inevitably.</comment>
