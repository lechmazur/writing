<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete motivation for Mara in uplifting contributors, embodied in combing manifests and cautious speech at event; Jun's whimsy enables alignment without stereotypes. Minor abstraction in "cautious exuberance thrums" slightly detaches embodiment from pivotal ledger-sharing moment, but final key exchange earns change with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from envelope mistake to ledger signatures; closure as charged poise in key-sharing reconfigures friendship/harbor cycles with felt secrecy cost. Orientation anchored in first lines; one tightening via name discovery holds to resonant end image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor/library setting vividly selective (salt breezes, swaying lamps, gulls), mirroring internal states through action; constrains choices like late opening post-symphony and roof rehearsals. Final rooftop display under stars charges closure image with environmental poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uplift via ledger signaled early, tightens accumulatively through word-drifting contributors and name trace, narrowing recognition risks. Agency in initiating display/event forecloses secrecy path with social cost legible in hesitant signatures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges organically from locket to ledger notes, reweighting harbor premise in final promise without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in "kindness circles back like returning tide" avoids moralizing, embracing ambiguity of ongoing cycles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (winds bookmarked, cargo sings) stable in third-limited; dialogue sparse but subtextual (Jun's tide-smile). Rhythm modulates pressure, distinct idiom in brief lines; elision of details taught early for poetic payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but pervasive metaphors ("envelope... sails," "gulls gossip") create minor figurative overload in mid-beats without full pattern restraint. Repetitive "after the symphony ends" motif works but risks template cadence; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harbor music/ledger transforms kindness trope via poetic particulars like resin-fixed splinters. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes organically; final bookmark/rope inflects ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
