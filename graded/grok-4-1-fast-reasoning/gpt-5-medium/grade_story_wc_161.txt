<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the past betrayal leaning in with "counterfeit smiles" versus sending Lark, earning the final trust reconfiguration with embodied cost in the "rusted hinge" loosening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust-mapping density builds to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "a hinge loosen where suspicion had rusted it shut" after attic-clearing pressure, with early orientation anchored cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust motes, skylight, and meteorite chip constrain choices (routes, balance) and charge final image of pigeons lifting through "gentle drift"; tactile attic integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust-preservation tightens via attic clearing forcing hurried copying and bird release, narrowing options under textural lens; agency in mapping/sending forecloses doubt path with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of refolding history through fragile exchanges emerges organically from scraps/pigeons/echo; final "pigeons carry us both ways... toward mercy" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in dust-as-stars, pigeons-as-choir sustains rhythmic lyricism; POV stable in first-person attic focalization, modulating intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (dust trails, blooming) propels without loops; minor register elevation in peak sends fits voice, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pigeon-training via dust motes and meteorite-calibrated scraps transforms trust trope into fresh lyric synthesis; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
