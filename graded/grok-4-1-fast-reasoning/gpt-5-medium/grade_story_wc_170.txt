<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority in the borrowed heartbeat's "cautious but eager" tempo syncing with rafter drips, earning the final reconciliation; contradictory fear in mirrors versus disciplined coaxing acts in scene with visible cost in braided desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from prism guidance to mirror visions, landing Charged Poise closure in the kitchen sun and open window images; cost legible in "coax them forward where we could greet them without lying."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism parapet droplets as "small lantern of refracted guidance" constrain entry choice early and recharge final "reef remembering sunlight"; selective sensory quiver matches rib tremor, charging closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to persuade mirrors tightens via lullaby singing that narrows from mistrust to citrus-road vision; protagonist agency in matching breath to drip forecloses defeat path with discipline cost felt in painter's approving nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing possibilities emerges organically from mirror ripples showing "hands I had yet to hold," reweighting premise in final open-window reach; resonant non-literal answer avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "colors trembled along the stone like shy birds" persists under pressure, with clean single-POV; painter's dialogue subtextually advances via "ask mirrors... like a friend to stay for tea."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of borrowed heart and lullaby-coded mirrors transforms transplant trope into coaxing discipline; risk in surreal painter atelier heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via prism-to-vision arc.</comment>
