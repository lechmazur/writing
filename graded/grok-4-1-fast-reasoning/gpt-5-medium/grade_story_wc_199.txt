<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotions like the dust speck warming and moss on knees; contradictory impulses shine in "I prod myself, delaying the eager reach," earning the final transformation of the hearer. Micro-choices reveal values under subtle pressure. Flawless for single-POV lyric mode, with no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: leaffall density builds to phrase emergence ("Emerges transformed always"), tightening to monument-building and CR closure where hearer transforms with conceptual cost ("my role is to keep ears growing"). Single scene, oriented early, pattern taught immediately. No causality breaks; quiet cadence shift reconfigures premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful: arbor's "roots braided into cloud" and lichens "sip thunder" filter through POV's "mossy delight," constraining choices via trays and cairns that guide leaves. Recurring dust speck and monuments charge final image of descent. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency; no white-room or clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode leaves) signaled early, escalates texturally via accumulating leaves forming phrase, narrowing to build "new monuments from seeds themselves" with felt cost in delayed haste ("sometimes haste only scatters"). Agency in sorting/prodding drives one decisive deepening. Subtle but coherent pressure to Charged Poise; minor cap for lyric restraint over visceral turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory/prophecy emerges organically from particulars like sparrow skull cairn and decoded phrase, culminating in non-literal CR ("what emerges transformed always is the hearer") reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in monuments "giving the conversation places to sit." Lingering ambiguity invites reflection; no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "veined script into legible threads" and rhythmic modulation (short punchy sentences in hush arrival, flowing in decoding); stable first-person POV with biased noticing (e.g., leaves as "petals from a giant silence"). No elision or head-hopping; voice as character, compressing under insight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ash sifts like sugar through the raftered branches" advances atmosphere/action/emotion); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent and purposeful, not overwriting in peak (phrase emergence). Minor hairline for occasional elevated diction, but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore tree as conversational arbor with seed monuments transforming hearer; tropes (prophetic leaves) ingeniously grounded in sorting craft. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable hindsight in CR. Bold, non-obvious premise fully committed.</comment>
