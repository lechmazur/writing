<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—tidal loyalty vs. relational migration—act simultaneously in the pause, earning the closure decision through prior micro-choices like tilting the cicada; interiority concrete and particular, flaws (tangential delay risks abandonment) complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build in foreseen futures to Charged Poise closure ("Yes, I will go inland"); on-page cost legible in "not to abandon the coast, but to extend it," foreclosing tide-only life; single scene oriented early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's drip "like a slow metronome" and stars constrain pause's reflective pressure; jade cicada on palm charges final image as "stubborn glint" trusted by partner, mirroring internal states through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inland archives vs. tide) signaled early, tightens texturally via sideways foresights narrowing to decision; agency in "circling truth until it offers passage" drives escalation, cost unmistakable in relational/logistical trade-off crystallized at "naming passage."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges organically from cicada/tide particulars, reweighting premise in final ripple "that found our ankles"; resonant non-literal answer via "arch had formed, patient, exact," lingering ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tidal idiom ("foam tightened by wind, then collapsing into lace") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates pause intensity, POV stable/single without elision; voice as character reflects chronicler's patience under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("starlight crawl its wings") varies rhythm without loops; metaphors cohere texturally (cicada seam, tide ebbing) in peak pause beat; no artifacts, read-aloud cadence breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler + cicada molting transforms relationship trope into "new littorals"; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable at "star fed hinges," heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
