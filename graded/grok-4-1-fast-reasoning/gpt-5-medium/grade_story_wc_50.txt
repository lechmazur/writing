<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Reflective locksmith's peripheral focus and listening to "wrongness" embody motivation consistently; micro-choices like chalking angles and leaving timer reveal hierarchy of values with cost. Internal conflict subtle in balancing patience/pressure; no strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously weaken peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to CR closure in stacking jars and leaving timer ("some keys should stay where they learn"), reweighting time storage with conceptual cost of forfeiture. Orientation anchored early in cavern arrival; single scene over days fits scope with legible progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marble cavern's calcite glints and echo chambers constrain mapping and harvesting choices; light beams at morning/noon/evening charge tactics and final hollow discovery. Recurrent brass prisms as micro-setting enable angles, mirroring internal reflective craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of echo-harvest signaled early tightens accumulatively via repair slips and sweet-toned hollow find, narrowing to rationed success; agency in whispering stories and releasing catch forecloses waste with felt cost in "grain in a lean year."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-as-stored mechanism emerges organically from timer/echo particulars, reweighting locks as "agreements" in final cellar image without statement; resonant non-literal answer in laugh-echo kept by cave embraces ambiguity of self-forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sidelong glints" and echo gradients sustains close third POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in repair tension, breathes in harvest tests. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cupped the device and listened to its wrongness"); varied rhythm propels, but metaphor pile-up ("powder from moons," "fruit ripening in shade") slightly muddles two peak beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh locksmith-echo synthesis transforms time tropes via cavern acoustics and jar instruments; risk of lyric process over plot heightens stakes in leaving timer, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
