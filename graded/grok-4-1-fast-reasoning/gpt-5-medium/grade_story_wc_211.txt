<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in prophecy dilemma, with embodied fear ("calm that frightens me") driving earned renunciation; interiority particular via sensory archiving process; flaw of over-archiving complicates choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase in residues/voices to Charged Poise closure ("fold the parchment over the wax shaving, unarchived"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "future shifts enough to shelter a child's unpinned breath."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard, basin, quinces constrain choices (roots crack if refuse, lean with wind) and charge final image (sighs like linen, quinces grip); sensory details (wetted bark, rainwater remembers roofs) filter through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive without harm) deepens via accidental prophecy under Accumulative lens, narrowing to refusal with visible cost (unrecording forecloses duty, averts child harm); agency in stylus stillness crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mercy in unrecording emerges implicitly from particulars (wax shaving, child's voice), reweighting oaths via final image without moral; purposeful ambiguity in prophecy lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (dead languages as lullabies, basin glassy-eyed) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates with pressure; first-person stable, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "Tiny islands of residue bob up"), varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful in lyric mode without muddle at closure, though heavy in mid-beats borders overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Skyscraper orchard grafting steel with oaths transforms tropes organically; fresh synthesis of archiving/prophecy via phonograph residue feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
