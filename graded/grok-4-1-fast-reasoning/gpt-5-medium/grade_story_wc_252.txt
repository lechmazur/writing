<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between "hardshell" facade and hidden grace act in micro-choices like threading ropes through belt; true naming closure earned with public vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scrimshaw ringing causally triggers whale call and fog staircase, delivering Charged Poise closure where island thickens post-naming with exposure cost legible in crowd's "heavy" silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dock bollards and mooring lines constrain detachment; recurring scrimshaw and whale song charge final crossing image, with sensory selection (thumb oil, ringing arms) filtered through dock worker's tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of true naming to hold island tightens accumulatively via whale demand and crowd pressure; agency in detaching lines publicly forecloses hiding, with cost felt in "silence heavy enough to crush careful lies."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pirate's shift from throats to carving reweights violence-to-tenderness theme through scrimshaw scenes; final "rebuild without fists" image answers central question of soft power resonantly without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature in muscular-sea metaphors ("grace...hide in my muscles," "sunlight on scales"); rhythm modulates from quiet storms to swelling note without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ringing traveled up my arms, like chain singing"); sea-storm metaphors cohere consistently in peak naming beat without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Post-pacification rule transforms pirate trope into "song that cut chains into ribbons"; bold lyric synthesis of island-naming and scrimshaw makes tenderness calculus inevitable and risky.</comment>
