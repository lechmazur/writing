<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's synesthetic embodiment grounds motives concretely ("chord of blue I can smell like winter plums"), while ghost's genteel panic compels collaborative micro-choices; minor lack of raw contradictory impulses under fracture keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from sensory trails to timeline crack ("another night falls through like confetti"), landing Charged Poise closure in "fractured timeline shivers... learning our rhythm" with undeniable ongoing-cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hedge maze/orchard micro-setting rearranges paths and supplies "lantern fruit" to constrain/enable ritual choices, charging final door of leaves; synesthetic details filter perfectly through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Timeline-mending stake signaled early escalates accumulatively via ghost's panic and chorus intrusion, protagonist's coin-pressing agency foreclosing spill with visible ritual-cost in daily return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nostalgia's complexity emerges organically from orchard echoes to final "house light rising," reweighting memory's preservative/release duality without literal moral; resonant counter-reading lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("smell green cymbals and hear gold leaves") biases noticing distinctively, with rhythmic syntax modulating pressure seamlessly; stable single-POV elides nothing unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic metaphors cohere purposefully without muddle ("paint shivers like spilled music"), driving density; minor figurative density in echo beats risks overwrite but propels without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthesia-fused theater-orchard ghost ritual transforms nostalgia trope into inevitable fractured-timeline synthesis; bold perceptual risks heighten closure without gimmickry.</comment>
