<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lark's interiority shines in embodied choices like looping the fob chain on the cutpurse's wrist, revealing steadfast traits under pressure; contradictory impulses (risk theft for sound) earn her capture with paid cost (limes/dignity). Kettle/smuggler apply crucible pressure via stares post-spill. Minor label slips like "curiously steadfast" don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry unease to lime-spill climax, landing CR closure in "brittle inhale like glass deciding to be sand again" with conceptual cost (trust's shape change). Orientation anchored early (Lark enters with recorder/fob); single scene fits defaults. Cost legible in final pocketed fob/tick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Pier timbers, limes, hush constrain choices (bare feet sense breath, spill triggers break, truce binds volume); sensory hierarchy (sounds prioritized) charges final "pier sighed... gray seam." Micro-setting (limes rolling as moons) mirrors internal tension purposefully. No white-room; vivid, selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust-break sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via false starts/lime spill forcing Kettle-smuggler recoil; agency in thwart narrows options with visible cost (coin/nod payment). Climax break reweights with undeniable pressure. One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust's sonic fragility emerges organically from web-pull/tug to "even justice sounded like something breaking"; final CR image (brittle inhale carried home) reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in hush-held shouts invites ambiguity without morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with sound-biased perceptual signature ("tick tripping his pulse," "wet gasp"); rhythmic prose modulates tension (short hisses peak, breathes lull). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early, legible at gull-shutoff closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "The pier breathed... salt and rot and lullaby"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (hush as "listening shawl"). Propulsion peaks at "brittle inhale," breathes post-climax without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-collecting in hush-truce market transforms pirate tropes into textural quest; fob-spill turn inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
