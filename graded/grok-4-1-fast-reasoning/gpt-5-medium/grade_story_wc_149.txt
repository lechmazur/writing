<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Keeper's foolish promise balanced by genuine intent, earning the final vow-keeping; ghost bride's debt-driven coaching reveals flaws and growth through specific micro-choices like pruning "press and release." Interiority embodied in lines like "promised like a fool, meaning it."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught ephemeral appearances building density to Charged Poise closure: orchard "shivered, then steadied itself like a vow," reconfiguring endless night with cost of her vanishing legible in "mournful elation." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse and fields; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse's glass "arterial with vines" and endless night constrain awakenings, mirroring internal states via "graft scar quivered"; charges final image of orchard warming its dark. Sensory hierarchy selective, POV-biased toward alchemical tasks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resonant awakening tightens accumulatively through bead drop and cameo lessons, narrowing to sapling cadence with agency in Keeper's speaking; cost felt in her veil "loosened into mist" and ignored trader foreclosing external paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of repaid debts and memory emerges organically from river backstory anchoring present orchard "marriages"; final image of chiming ghost reweights vows without moralizing, offering resonant answer via "correcting my gratitude to action."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical idiom like "frost breathed inward" stable in single POV; sparse dialogue natural with subtext, e.g., "you tune the bells but not the longing." Rhythmic control modulates to closure poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "bead drop... every graft scar quivered"; figurative patterns coherent (cinders, mist), no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion, ear-test flawless at peak "mournful elation."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost bride repaying forgotten river debt transforms tropes into alchemical orchard logic; risk-taking in lyric accumulations heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via bead's planetary turn.</comment>
