<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines in concrete contradictions like the "old prickle of embarrassment" when fulfilling prophecies, compelling micro-choices such as setting bottles subtly. Flaws (vanity fear) complicate orchestration without tidy resolution. Final endurance—pretending not to hear thanks—earns closure with felt cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/hush/breathing builds to Charged Poise closure in mountain's "sideways and gentle" exhale and bug release as "revised stars," with Mara's humility as conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early ("black sand beach at the foot of the active volcano"). Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "firm sand and lazy current," guiding bottle trail and evacuation. Bottles as micro-setting recur, charging final release. Sensory hierarchy (hush, shimmer, grit) reflects Mara's priorities; volcano "practicing restraint" mirrors internal transformation, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe extraction via orchestrated hush) signaled early, escalates texturally as strangers sync rhythms then crowd follows light, narrowing to collective poise. Agency in "urged them to stand where the sand remembered" forces trade-off (myth risk). Cost unmistakable in calm plume without panic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "useful kindness" vs. destiny emerges organically from particulars like accidental prophecy, reweighted in bug release without moralizing. Final image answers "texture of transformation" non-literally, satisfying 9+ test; ambiguity lingers in her denied heroism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in phrases like "lightning in jars and a sigh instead of fire." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (volcanologist's "practicing restraint"). Rhythm modulates pressure, no head-hopping; elisions (prophecy) taught early, paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines like "coincidence could be arranged, the way driftwood could be nudged" advance multiple layers without loops. Figurative pattern (breathing/light) taught early, coherent under pressure; rhythm varies, propels to closure image unscathed, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bug-jar evacuation as "evacuation practice sung softly" transforms prophecy trope via Mara's flawed orchestration. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; no derivatives, bold celestial/volcanic weave heightens stakes organically.</comment>
