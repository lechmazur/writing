<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in rib-hearing and pulse-ocean lean; contradictory impulses surface in testing longing vs. pattern, earning final knot-maker promise with self-web cost. Mother's pot song threads personal arc without safety-hedging. Flawless under single-POV lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echo density builds from boy-lantern to debt-webs, culminating in CR closure—"So that is why some people echo... I promise the water I will be a knot-maker"—with felt cost of revealed personal entanglements. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus water/reeds/stone constrain choices—sings silver rope, kneels in shallows, aims shell—charging final doubled-tone return. Sensory hierarchy (reed melancholy, silt crown) reflects perceptual bias. Micro-setting (shell, water) recharges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn echo persistence) deepens texturally from hoped thread to debt-webs, narrowing to self-tether revelation; agency in questions/singing mother's song forecloses cutter-path with "web hums where I believed empty sky." Cost legible in heartbeat-hold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of entanglement-emerges organically from braid/knot/debt images, reweighted in final promise tying "kindness to clarity" without moralizing. Mother's forgiveness doubles tone, resonating non-literal answer to echo-question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sand-syllables" and "moon bone"; rhythmic prose modulates from melancholy to charged hold without head-hopping or withholding. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops/paraphrase; metaphors cohere in braid/rope/web pattern without muddle. Propulsion peaks in "silence full of teeth," varying rhythm under insight pressure; zero artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-folklore into debt-tether logic, transformed via shell/nexus; risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens personal stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "promises make echoes stoop to drink."</comment>
