<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vendor's motivation to seek story beginnings drives concrete micro-choices like pouring moonlight and quantifying absence, with endurance of the "difficult to endure" method showing internal struggle. Embodied perception in "felt its meaning test my palm" reveals particularity under pressure. Earned change in acquiring the comma-seed forecloses paths with attention's cost, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak chamber beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of absence imagery builds via map incision, vellum door, and chamber quantification to CR closure in comma-seed image reweighting beginnings' premise with absence contract's conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in shop/clouds setup. One tightening via hinge outline suffices; lens unambiguous at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard shelves and cloud sea filter through vendor's priorities, guiding path via countertop map and constraining via dust/plinth measurements. Recurring glass apple charges final seed-cupped image. Sensory selection (creaks like prologues, moonlight glaze) purposeful, vivid, integrated without stalls; body as micro-setting in palm-test constrains acceptance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (story origins) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed pretense-reading to quantification deepening options/knowledge in chamber. Agency in ledger-offering and moonlight-pouring forecloses paths with endurance cost, legible in plinth sigh and contract specificity. One tightening sufficient under lens; cost unmistakable in seed's "heavy with maybe."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings' parole emerges organically via images (vellum door shingle, comma-seed), culminating in resonant final image reweighting absence/attention without moral. Subtext in "beginnings apply for release" invites ambiguity on petition costs. No direct statement; complexity lingers in hush-to-snow hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("moonlight shows what words intend") and rhythmic modulation (short fragments in chamber quantification) heighten pressure. First-person stable, no elision; syntax reflects meditative mind. Prose texture unique in syntax like "count the spaces, weigh the pauses."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "incise is to cut light from shadow until a route declares itself"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in clustered metaphors ("hush like rain deciding to be snow") during chamber peak slightly muddles without obscuring closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion clear to seed image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vendor-court metaphor transforms trope of "new starts" via glass/parole logic, with comma-seed inevitability from quantified absence. Risky fragmentation heightens stakes; no derivatives, echoes transformed organically.</comment>
