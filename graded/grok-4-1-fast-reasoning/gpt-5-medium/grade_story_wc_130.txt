<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied ache (laugh as "beacon and ache"); contradictory impulses act in ritual choices like threading eyes, earning final endurance of carrying unsolved theorem. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy, confronting flaw of ambiguous loss without tidy resolution. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via ritual buildup; single scene anchored by ~50 words (conjurer unpacks in cavern orchard). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with felt cost in final image ("carries a theorem he cannot solve but can carry, which is enough for now"). No orientation debt; lens holds seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (cavern orchard, stalactites dripping into bowls) constrains choices (flat root for stone, stalactite for rope) and charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy (mineral sweetness exhales, fruit glistens like tears) filtered through conjurer's perceptual bias. Micro-setting as body/tool (rope threaded through eyes) recharges final pocket merger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of emotion amid loss) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density in ritual beats (eyes sway as pendulums → mosaic theorem). Agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses reunion path with legible cost (hinges stop squealing via carried coherence). One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (emotion's math) emerges organically from particulars like sister's button fractions → mosaic theorem, reweighting premise in CR ending without moralizing. Final image (rope in pocket as "quiet merger") offers resonant answer to coherence question. No platitudes; ambiguity lingers in unsolved theorem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mathematical diction ("sorrow approaches a limit," "love equals attention multiplied"); rhythmic control modulates from hushed ritual to charged poise. Stable single-POV with clean free indirect; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (sentences layer image/action like "threads the rope through the glass eyes, knotting them gently"); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor figurative density in reflections ("curves meeting, approaching, never touching") risks coherence but pattern-taught as lyric math motif, no muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes/mosaic in cavern orchard transforms grief tropes via math lens; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration ("gentler mathematics") inevitable from particulars. Bold, non-obvious premise fully committed.</comment>
