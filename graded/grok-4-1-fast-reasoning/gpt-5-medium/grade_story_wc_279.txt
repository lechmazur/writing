<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's social perceptiveness drives interjection with bearded man, revealing interior contradiction between whimsy and gentle intervention; embodied emotions via warming tile and restless chalks. Minor epiphanic phrasing like "belief is a kind of finger" borders stock but anchors in prior grief cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from drizzle voices to emergent hush; closure as Charged Poise in "emergent hush rode home in breathing" reconfigures unlearning with cost of sustained messiness legible in smudged map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's mist and echoes constrain sound-leaning via tile flake, charging final hush image; sensory selectivity (lilac unease, vapor loops) mirrors perceptual bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of meaning in mess deepens via interjection turning bearded man's pebble and child's ear-to-stone, forcing stance crystallization under accumulative lens; cost felt in "old slogans cracked... like useless antlers."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of messy meaning emerges organically from sand nudges and hush pooling, resonant in final kite-tugging chest and carried hush without moralizing; child's "stay messy" reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("social weather," "chalk is a listening stone") modulates rhythmically; stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early, paid in closure hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion; minor overwriting in stacked figures (e.g., "dusk deciding whether to commit to night") purposeful in lyric mode but risks muddle, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk artistry and unlearning ritual via tile flake transforms workshop trope; risk-taking in poetic acoustics heightens stakes inevitably to hush's conceptual cost.</comment>
