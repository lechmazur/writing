<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied through hands calming chaos and listening to silence; contradictory belief in superstition drives ritual choices to earned remaking at "unshaken and remade." Final endurance forecloses doubt with felt emotional cost in vision blinking away.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds from setup to radio voice and vision; Charged Poise closure at sealing chip reconfigures silence with cost in "one last spark before oblivion," legible in dimming chip and paling aurora.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto and aurora constrain ritual and charge final image, with drips, murmurs, and green fire mirroring internal threshold; selective sensory hierarchy reflects POV's watchful profession without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture spark tightens via static-to-voice deepening under accumulative lens, narrowing to infusion trade-off; cost legible in chip's exhaustion and vision's blink, charging poise though micro-turn faint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grace in grief emerges organically from ritual particulars like brush-tap rhythm; final shawl-of-air image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting stillness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature in threading constellations from static; rhythmic poetic diction modulates with pressure, consistent bias in noticing pulses and thresholds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors taught early, propelling to closure without loops; minor figurative density in peak radio beat contained by pattern payoff in vision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician ritual with whisper-engine under aurora transforms death tropes; risk in lucid watchfulness heightens stakes to inevitable spark-capture hindsight.</comment>
