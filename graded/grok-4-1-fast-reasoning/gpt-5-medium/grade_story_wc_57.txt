<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in coaxing the resistant splice via humming yield a micro-choice revealing patience as active endurance; final proving via fir cone seeds earns trust with visible cost in vigil time. Interiority concrete via rope's "slow grammar" and embodied listening. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through actions like whispering lessons to seeds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from initial knot-reading to amphorae revelation and seed-proving, culminating in Charged Poise closure of shared dawn listening with vigil cost legible in "kept vigil with the rope." Orientation anchored in first paragraph (dock, snow, harbor). Single scene coherent; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dock's "golden boards" under snow and fog constrain listening via tactile rope coils and fulgurite placement, charging final harbor beat; sensory hierarchy (oceanic hush in bones, rope whisper) POV-specific. Details evolve (fog thickens, dawn relief) mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (rope, glass) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation via decoding) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative density in knot revelations (clove hitch drought memory) and resistant splice tightening options to patient coaxing; proves agency in seed bundling with cost of night vigil foreclosing haste. One decisive deepening sufficient; cost unmistakable in dawn payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patient preservation emerges via knot-seed parallels, resonating in final shared listening reweighting memory as communal without moralizing; returning rope/frays shift from individual vigil to trusted archive. Subtext in "attention is a sailor's prayer" earned through particulars, inviting ambiguity on weavers' reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "rope remembers" and "tidal scripture"; rhythmic syntax modulates from hushed observation to yielding splice. Single POV stable, voice poetic yet grounded; no head-hopping or withholding. Prose reflects patient mind without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fulgurite glass warming inside my mitten" advances tool/setting/emotion); metaphors coherent (lightning-root, constellations in knots) taught early, no muddle or loops in peak splice beat. Rhythmic variety propels; zero scaffolds, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fulgurite-rope-weavers transforms folklore into tactile mnemonic system; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes of unraveling knowledge, inevitable in hindsight via seed-proofing turn. No derivative echoes; bold perceptual frame memorable.</comment>
