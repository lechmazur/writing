<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sister's memory concretely anchors patience as endurance, tying past waiting to present tree-climb revelation; contradictory impulses in frozen-thumb struggle vs. stillness show embodied conflict driving micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns densify from discarded items to starlight-braided map, culminating in RR closure ("the lake exhaled") with legible cost in saved light and physical patience; orientation anchored early in orchard/crater.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ampoule and plate as micro-settings constrain choices (unsealing fight, listening dish) and charge final image (fitted over fissure); selective sensory hierarchy (frosted lashes, root pulse) reflects alchemical urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate heartbeats to escape silence) tightens via starlight revelation narrowing to eye-trunk/fissure, forcing endurance agency; cost unmistakable in pinched glove sealing light for return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of persistent life (heartbeats) guiding stasis emerges organically from particulars like bark-eye scab, reweighted in final exhale without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in aurora's "patient step."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sap "frozen mid-throb," shadows bending) biases toward alchemical translation; rhythmic control modulates from hush to propulsion in closure, POV stable without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frost traced his eyelashes" advances patience/atmosphere); minor artifact in verbatim "creating patterns" repeat dulled one beat but purposeful under lyric texture, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Flash-paper strips and starlight ampoule synthesize fresh alchemical mapping of pulses, transforming post-silence tropes via risk-taking compression; hindsight inevitability in heartbeats-to-breath payoff.</comment>
