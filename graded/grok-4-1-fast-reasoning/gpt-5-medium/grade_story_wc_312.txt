<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Efan's micro-choices like chalking numbers and tying seaweed reveal contradictory impulses of naive belief and uncertain hands cradling brittle devotion, earning the relieved smile at closure without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as drip observations densify into pattern whisper and hum coordination; RR closure lands with legible cost in "only rebuilt an echo" amid sea's modest return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's salt scar and stone joints constrain drip-watching and bell placement, charging final ripple; sensory hierarchy (drips as syllables, sea's damp-cloth breath) biases through Efan's perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of righting imbalance tightens via density to syllable-aligned drips and hum; agency in steady trials forecloses triumph for echo's mercy, but subtle escalation lacks one sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brittle vs. steady devotion emerges organically, answered non-literally by "silver ripple returned, modest as a memory that decides to stay," reweighting cosmic repair without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature in "water bead... single syllables"; dialogue subtext (fisherman's nod as "pew creaking") distinguishes voices amid lyrical rhythm modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density integrates figures like "pauses between gulls" without muddle; varied syntax propels from observation to hum without loops or scaffolds, ear-test clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drip-mathematics and cosmic crack transforms mage-tide tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens quiet ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
