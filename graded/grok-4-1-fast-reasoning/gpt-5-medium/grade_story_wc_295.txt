<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to decode via dreams and stars compels witnessing Mara, with embodied conflict in delaying telegram ("fearing what the petals sheltered"). Final "yes" to continued witnessing earned by shared reading, foreclosing solitary decoding with relational cost. Mara applies pressure as crucible, revealing father's mirror-search; voices distinct. Minor slip: some interiority poetic but less contradictory impulses in peak shared beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: star flux density builds to braided voices yielding temple rooms, reconfiguring decoding as conversation (RR/Charged Poise). Orientation anchored early ("celestial mapping observatory...lucid dream chronicler"). Closure cost legible: "voices did not cure grief, but...carried some weight together," storing story in breathing. Single scene/shards fit defaults, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory domes, scopes, red lamps constrain choices (tuning for star grammar); recurring daylily charges reprise from telegram to knuckle rasp to final color. Sensory hierarchy: star shiver, paper breath reflect POV priorities. Spatial choreography clear (charts beside sextant, Mara's palms on glyphs). Micro-setting (sextant, arrays) shapes method, charges final dome rewind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode inscriptions) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via star syllables to shared reading narrowing solitary options. Agency in inviting Mara's counterpoints forces trade-off (solitary vs. shared burden). Cost unmistakable: "sorrow washed its hands," weight carried together. One tightening sufficient under lens; no reversal required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges via mirror pilgrimage, voices braiding inscriptions; final log reweights witnessing as "bandage that breathes" without statement. Resonance from particulars (star grammar, daylily sentinel); no moralizing, ambiguity in "not cure grief." Protagonist arc inextricable: solitary decoder to paired witness. Conceptual repricing charges "temple listens" image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: stars as "syllables falling like water," syntax rhythmic/poetic modulating with intensity (chamber warms). Stable first-person POV, no leakage; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("that was sufficient"). Prose reflects mind: flux to grammar. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud (short star pulses, longer confessions); density high, multi-job lines (e.g., "graphs steadied, I began reading...syllables falling"). Minor overwrite: metaphor density in reading beat ("light and her voice braided") purposeful but borders coherence in "silence framed clauses." No loops, scaffold; clean grammar. Slight template cadence in star motifs touches non-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: variable stars as temple grammar decoded via shared voice transforms mysticism into intimate practice. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes (echoes pattern constrains closure). No derivatives; particular details (Cepheid's vow) inevitable in hindsight. Bold perceptual angle on healing avoids tropes.</comment>
