<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jae's motivation to prove sideways time drives concrete micro-choices like building the probe and pulling the lever; embodied interiority peaks in "kept his place by the rhythm of his heart" under surge stress; final forgiveness earned as conceptual cost of his own temporal slip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery density builds to CR closure at "the returns included him, slightly turned, slightly smiling," reweighting proof with personal cost; causal chain from missing mantas through lever pull to field inversion tight; orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ravine nexus and vault constrain probe activation and lever pull; "compasses ticked like trapped insects" filters through Jae's mechanic priorities; final vault return charges closure image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save mantas/prove theory) signaled early, escalates via probe lattice tightening to inversion reversal under Accumulative lens; agency in Jae's field tuning forecloses lateral trap with repair cost; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sideways time theme emerges organically from nexus trap to affectionate proof; final CR image "vault sang faintly, a choir of delayed selves" reweights premise without statement, embracing temporal ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "wind combed the research decks" and rhythmic modulation under stress; stable close third-person POV with no leakage; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via "sheets like early snow" without loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (e.g., "breath pulled sideways through ice") without muddle in climax; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sideways time synthesized with holographic nexus and manta migration feels inevitable; transforms sci-fi tropes through Jae's personal slip in final image; bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
