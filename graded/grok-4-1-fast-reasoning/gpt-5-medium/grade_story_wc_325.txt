<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (claustrophobia vs. compulsion) act vividly in the squeeze ("Panic hummed, but I counted drips"), earning the final renunciation of keeping the fleck with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to CR closure: leaving the fleck on the pad reconfigures her debt with conceptual cost legible in "The machine had enough of me and more of them."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Body and cave (squeeze "pinched my ribs", air seams) constrain choices throughout; final "sea took a long breath" charges image as micro-setting payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (return/stand by unremembered) signaled early, tightens texturally via narrowing spaces and name-reading deepening; agency in RETURN press forecloses escape option with tide cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mutual noticing emerges organically from tracking invisible things to reading names; final image non-literally answers without moralizing, reweighting her smallness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air seams whispering", "magnetic itch") biases details claustrophobically; rhythmic compression under stress ("belly against rock, breath rationed") heightens pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("Ice bridged the broken gap, heat from my mouth turning the boundary"); metaphors coherent and purposeful in peak door moment, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of monastic gold in brine-tech with phase lock; risky poetic compression on cables' "murmurs of continents" feels inevitable, transforming tropes.</comment>
