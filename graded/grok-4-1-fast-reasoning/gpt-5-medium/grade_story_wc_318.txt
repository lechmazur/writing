<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conductor's interior contradiction between mournful eagerness and ritual pulls (e.g., reddened knuckles) earns the final thanks; traits shown through relic-handling and ghost-nodding compel the closure choice without abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of gusts and echoes builds to Charged Poise closure in "house sighs awake and cracks its knuckles," reweighting silence with risked everything; orientation anchored early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tunnel as micro-setting constrains via returning "heavier twin" breaths and vents snaking to house, charging final exhale; selective sensory hierarchy (e.g., salted breath) mirrors urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early tightens via returned squeal forcing tempo adjustment; agency in yanking cords shows endurance cost (knuckles redden) under accumulative cadence shift, though Grief's passive listening softens one reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harvesting stifled chuckles from grief emerges via mulch notes with "grass-stained knees"; final "repaired silence" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in skewed "lanterns in fog" noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in half-sung commands, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with wobbling notes matching scene propulsion, high density integrates image/action; figurative density (e.g., macerate sorrow) risks coherence in peak but pattern-taught as voice from opening hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Leaf blowers as orchestra transforms grief-work trope into fresh synthesis; risk of machines humming "lint and oak" pays off in foundational laughter, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
