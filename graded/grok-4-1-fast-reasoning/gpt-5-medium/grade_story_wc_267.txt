<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's embodied pain ("nerves complained like old tenants") and micro-choices (pocketing bolt, sitting despite pain) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure, earning the final endurance at the bench. Bellhop applies silent pressure via gestures, forcing relational choices. Closure choice motivated by accumulated listening, with visible cost in sensation paid on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival sparks to radiator Morse ("seventh week"), culminating in Charged Poise RR at "I chose to remain... walls released their cached winter." Cost legible in "shorter letters" of nerves accepting cold hope. Orientation anchored early ("cobalt fortress under snow"); single-shard progression with one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt windows ("blurring snow into oceanic ghosts") and radiators ("clicked like teeth") constrain choices (fogged treble clef guides rehearsal) and charge final image (faint window print). Sensory hierarchy reflects pain urgency; details tactile/lived-in, mirroring internal frost without overt symbols. Micro-object bolt anchors steadiness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cost of safety) signaled early, escalates via density (days as drifts, nerve shocks) to agency in "remain[ing]... played easing," narrowing to silent harmony vs. hush. Cost felt in patience/sensation; one deepening (Morse translation) reweights under Textural lens, charging closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (safety's silence vs. smuggled hope) emerges via particulars like hummed pipes, resonant in final "permission softer than law," reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in gestures (zipper lips); ambiguity lingers in "silence... no longer asked us to forgive it."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pain made a metronome of me") biases noticing (radiator teeth, frost scrapes); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, compressing at peak ("bolt clicked... steadied me"). Stable first-person lyric voice taught early, legible closure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density ("wrist wrapped in wires blooming little sparks") propels via varied rhythm/syntax; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs (metaphors consistent, voice-motivated). Propulsion peaks clean in closure beat ("fortress exhaled a warmer kind of rule"); read-aloud ear excels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choral injury, silent fortress, bolt-as-steadiness transforms silence trope into renegotiated hope; bold lyric risk (non-playing "easing") heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration ("hope could be cold and still be hope") inevitable from particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
