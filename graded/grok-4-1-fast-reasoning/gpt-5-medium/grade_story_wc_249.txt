<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in quietly rebellious micro-choices like smiling at cameras while drumming rhythms, earning the fusion bargain with donors; interiority concrete via knuckles chiming and numb fingers memory. Final awakening choice forecloses pre-treatment past with felt relational cost. Voice specificity elevates beyond stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via drumming density building to resonant reconfiguration (Mira's eyes opening, carrying lagoon); orientation anchored early in research wing/garden. Closure RR lands on-page with undeniable cost: "We would not return to before," reweighting entanglement premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden as micro-setting constrains perching/drumming choices and charges final image ("garden had already decided"); sensory hierarchy (sound pulses, trembling chords) reflects POV urgency. Recurring rails/gravel evolve tactilely through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shared dream via drumming) signaled early tightens texturally through donor eruption reversal, narrowing to bargain; agency in rhythm taps forces Mira's bridge-step. Cost legible in carrying strangers ("honor the after"), charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of entanglement as bridge emerges organically from drumming particulars and donor splice, reweighting via final nod blessing; resonant non-literal answer in "learn its music" avoids moralizing. Counter-reading (problematic fusion) lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-braided diction/rhythm (whales writing letters) stable in first-person; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure cadence. No head-hopping, voice modulates peak stress fluidly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere in sound-wave pattern without muddle (e.g., "ripple was a syllable"); zero loops, varied syntax accelerates to "monitors listened." Figurative density serves taught texture, passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi entanglement and lyric sound-ritual transforms tropes (grief treatment) via drumming bridge; risk-taking in poetic sci-fi heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early garden pulse to donor-honoring close.</comment>
