<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete micro-choices like "pegging slats by whorls," revealing sculptor traits under storm pressure; motivation intensifies through cartographer's echoed advice compelling the gate-build; earned change in final vow, but lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lantern projection to collaborative build, culminating in Charged Poise CR where "gate remains, a reimagined contour" reconfigures passage with patience's conceptual cost; orientation anchored early at breakwater/archway; one tightening as storm "unspools to rhythm like gears."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood "rib and keel from tideline" and lantern light constrain building choices, charging final gate image; sensory hierarchy (ferric air, gull cries) reflects sculptor's priorities; storm/archway evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine passage post-GPS) signaled early, textural escalation via deepening density of figures' guidance and storm's turn forcing patient joins; agency in gathering/pegging forecloses hasty paths with visible cost in dawn's "shy arrival"; cost legible in perpetual vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient joining emerges organically from build's particulars, final image of "gate... teaching the archway to cradle" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting alliances without moralizing; subtext in silhouettes' invitations avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reads knots the way others read lines on palms") biases noticing toward wood/sea; rhythmic modulation peaks in build ("click like mortises finding tenons"); stable first-person lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "storm stitch me... with rain like threaded needles"; varied rhythm passes ear test, but figurative density borders overwriting in build beat ("layered meanings click"), slightly dulling propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of slide-projections enabling timewoven build transforms driftwood trope into scaffolded alliances; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via cartographer's blueprint payoff.</comment>
