<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mailman's internal conflict between regulations and streets manifests in concrete micro-choices like staying with Mina and delivering the wrongly routed letter, earning the closure delivery with visible relational cost. Embodied emotions (arm hairs saluting thunder) and flaws (rebellious fostering) drive motivation without epiphanies. Mina's pressure reveals character limits effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of absences and promises builds to Charged Poise closure in the boy's delivery and lighter sack, with cost in jar's risk and rebellion legible in the final arcade image. Orientation anchors early (alleys, checkpoints by ~100 words). Single thread coheres without shards or breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring cobalt arcade constrains route and charges final image as forgiven threshold; creek batteries and drone whine tactilely shape navigation by absences. Sensory hierarchy (whine like mosquitoes, penny-taste water) filters through mailman's priorities. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from drop to Mina to boy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (foster ties amid borders) signaled early tightens accumulatively via jar's pulse to Mina's mirror reveal and boy's wait, narrowing to rebellious delivery with felt risk/cost in sack's weight. Agency in staying and re-routing letter drives escalation under lens. One deepening suffices, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of linking absences to heal promises emerges organically from navigation method, jar release, and mirror faces, reweighting premise in final portrait without statement. Boy's delivery offers non-literal resonant answer to central question. Complexity lingers in moral ambiguity of rebellion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (maps exhaling, absences as roads) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from brittle hush to gentler rain. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Mina's "you foster futures"). Stable first-person with no leakage; elisions taught early pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (short hisses amid longer folds); metaphors cohere in weather/promise pattern without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops ("broken promises") pattern-taught, not dragging closure. Varied syntax propels to brightening room and exhaling maps.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of border mailman, thunderstorm jar, and absence-mapping transforms tropes; jar's mirror catalog and linking holes feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise fully.</comment>
