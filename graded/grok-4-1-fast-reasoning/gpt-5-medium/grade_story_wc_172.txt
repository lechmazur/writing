<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (amoral funding vs. sentimental hoarding) act in scene via egg placement and whisper; final release earned with embodied cost ("slackening in his spine"). Reflection anchors concretely to present cues like the egg without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to CR closure ("egg grew lighter... chamber drank the dust"); cost legible in "powder drifted like frost" and final rain image reconfiguring forgiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains via cracks/oculus guiding egg placement and charges closure ("pressed his palm to the salt"); sensory hierarchy (glittering crystals, hum) reflects sentimental POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (echo preservation) signaled early, tightens via egg tremble/crack under Accumulative lens; agency in tuning fork/speakers, cost in powder loss alters tactics to packing/release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of echoes over life emerges organically via egg-bell ritual; final "nearly forgiven" reweights ruthless compassion without moralizing, resonant via prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sentiment scented like petrichor); rhythmic control modulates to charged poise in peak ("breath came back... stuttering like a rescued engine").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "hum ran along the cracks"); metaphors coherent/patterned (echoes/bells), no loops; rhythm varies for ear test in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drought-engineered echo-altar transforms philanthropist trope; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via egg's "exhale its remembered weight".</comment>
