<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory homesickness and willingness to wait act simultaneously in pivotal pendant-weighing beat, earning final endurance with tithe cost; guardian's wolf-tenderness forces micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Voice-particular interiority avoids epiphanies. Closure choice motivated without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (mist/light/folding) tightens to Charged Poise closure in "I leave by not leaving," reconfiguring exile with breath-tithe cost legible in final image. Continuous dream-shard scene; deliberate disorientation pays off thematically. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen garden mist and sundial constrain choices (e.g., shadow's "frozen mid-confession" mirrors refusal to cross light boundaries), charging final interiorized carry. Sensory bias (vellum/salt smell) POV-specific; evolves causally to thaw-syllabus. Micro-objects like pendant integrate tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriend uncertainty) signaled early, textural escalation via mist-thickening/other gardens deepens to pendant interaction narrowing options; agency in offering wait forecloses exile with companionable-ache cost felt on-page. No major reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (carry uncertainty via interiorizing) emerges implicitly from particulars like bead's "small sunrise refuses to cross," final image reweights premise without moral—thresholds-as-books resonate as non-literal answer. Counter-readings linger in ache's ambiguity; no sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("interiorizing horizons," "read by frostbite") biases noticing; sparse dialogue subtextual ("dialect of erasure") advances via implication. Rhythmic modulation under mist-pressure; stable first-person with purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Waiting is not inaction here; it is binding"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts—metaphors consistent/pattern-taught without muddle or drift in peak pendant beat. Propulsion matches lyric escalation; zero scaffold in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral-library surrealism and dimensional homesickness transforms tropes via "books like thresholds" frame; bold poetic risk heightens stakes in mist-pressure without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from early pattern; authentic vision coheres.</comment>
