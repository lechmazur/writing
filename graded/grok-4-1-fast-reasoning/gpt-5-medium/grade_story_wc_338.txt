<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's methodically curious trait drives micro-choices like video comparison and seam-tracing, earning the final framing decision with embodied gratitude. Verger applies secondary pressure via reluctant shrug. Minor weakness: internal conflict more steady endurance than contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from map tear to video anomalies to chapel discovery, landing Charged Poise closure in framing the tear-visible map with felt cost of exposed unknown. Orientation anchored early via hiring and henge. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught via silences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (rain eating limestone, cold air nicking fingertips, hushed threading) constrain choices like seam-tracing and charge final henge vigil image. POV-filtered (framer's bevel/needle metaphors) without catalog; fresco vault evolves causally with lamps warming paint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (filling map blank/interpreting silence) signaled early, tightens via video deepening to reopening, forcing trade-off in village gathering and exposure risk. Agency in promising no solo reopen; cost legible in wiped verger face and careful feet. Minor abstractness in some stakes declarations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as architecture (not miracle) emerges organically from particulars like pricked names and shingled lean-to, resonating in final map-tear frame reweighting known/unknown without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (crossed self vs. listening) invites ambiguity on patience's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (framer's shielded openness in metaphors like "slow animal with patient tongue") modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable first-person with no leakage. Verger dialogue natural/subtextual ("shrug that tried to be refusal"); purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance + image) sans loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short peak sentences like "He agreed with a shrug"). Figurative language purposeful/patterned (rain/scoured motifs), no muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: map framer's video method unveils architectural hush, transforming discovery tropes via perceptual voice. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmick; henge reprise feels inevitable. Minor proximity to quiet revelation tales but personalized through trade.</comment>
