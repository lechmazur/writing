<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through poetic, character-specific metaphors like "golden-hour portrait thief" reveal motives and evolution; final change from stealing to returning earned by prior light-sharing choices with mentor's "ruinous gratitude" as felt cost. Contradictory impulses in "steal only what the day is already losing" act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/flower images builds to CR closure where moonbeams revive photos, reweighting theft to return with cost in mentor's "thinner" failure and "unspent horizon." Orientation anchored early in station/sunset; continuous scene causality via bouquet-jar progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emerald station constrains path through "disused track" and "turnstile of sycamores," charging final image as moths "stitched our way"; sensory details like "wolfsbane... guarded by rue" filter through POV savvy, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hear destiny via summons) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through bouquet reading to jar-unlocking revival; agency in unstoppering jar forecloses failure with legible cost in mentor's state, reweighting craft under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "illuminated moments" as astonishment emerges organically from jar reviving "negatives that had failed," offering resonant CR answer in "light that admits darkness" without moralizing; final image recharges prior theft motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("flowers' hush-hushed alphabets"); stable first-person lyric compression taught early pays off at closure; mentor's sparse dialogue ("Teach me, he whispered") natural, subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel via image-charged syntax, but figurative piling ("moonbeams... like careful bees, settling into each waiting rectangle") in climax risks minor coherence strain under Overwriting Check, slightly dulling peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief-as-giver via moonbeam-jar mechanics transforms light-capture trope; risk-taking in floral codes and station choreography feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
