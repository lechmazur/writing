<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses (heart "thrummed between" traders and ash-keepers) act in scene, compelling micro-choices like glue analysis and gate-tuning; final accord earned via prior sabotage discovery with visible cost in refusing vengeance scaffolds. Internal voice concrete and embodied (trembling hands). Secondary child and council apply targeted pressure without overwhelming clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chain-pacing to glue-spectrum to sluice-discovery, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "council sealed our pact with a nod" where equilibrium reconfigures prior discord with felt cost (trembling from gratitude balance). Orientation anchored by ~100 words. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in final breathing harmony image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amphitheater's breathing powder and pumice slits constrain choices (pacing ellipse hears pressure, chain traces catenary); body/tool (ear to rock) charges final image of "gratitude traveling through pipes." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (machinist notes valve moods, gate hums). Details evolve with action, mirroring internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize water/ash) signaled early, tightens via glue-proof revelation narrowing options to sly truth-telling; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift to gate-hum reweights with trade-off cost (careers spared but logged transparency). Agency in tuning forecloses solo flows. Moral calculus (compassion vs. vengeance) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fairness as encrypted engineering emerges organically from glue-residue lovers and chain-compromise, answered non-literally in final "lullaby of patient power" reweighting discord into transforming forgiveness without moralizing. Subtext in silences (unnamed names). Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing "sugar signatures," gate "chords not solos") biases toward machinist harmony; rhythmic prose modulates with pressure (syncopation raps). Stable first-person; council voices "braided" idiomatically. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chain... clicking polite applause" advances action/voice/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative pattern (breathing motif) taught early, coherent in peak tuning beat without muddle. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glue-adhesive as compassion-encryption transforms sabotage trope into tender guild-union revelation, inevitable via machinist lens; risk-taking in lyric catenary-chain engineering heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits to premise.</comment>
