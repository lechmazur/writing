<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Librarian's hinge-hearted patience and contradictory embrace of flux compel the key endurance at closure, embodied in clockwork shoulders and forgiving stamps. Woman's migratory flux creates crucible pressure, earning her true name's settling. Final choice to "keep" forecloses forgetting with felt cost of eternal tides.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from atrium opening to bells' migratory pitch, landing Charged Poise RR in final gears' "keep, keep, keep" with vigilance cost. Orientation anchored early in tidal library. No shards; single poetic scene coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Barnacles chanting Dewey and spines breathing constrain cataloging choices; creel and bells as micro-settings charge final hush. Sensory hierarchy (iron-sea moss, salt-flecked panes) filters through librarian's priorities. Atrium evolves with tide, mirroring flux.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving identities vs. tidal erasure—tightens accumulatively when cards settle via smelted bells, narrowing flux options. Agency in pouring creel words forces trade-off; cost legible in kelp drying to signature, charging woman's departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-in-routine emerges via paradox shelving, resonant in creel's fin-words and final "tides turn pages" without moralizing. Migrating images reweight flux as appetite; ending answers flux via eternal keeping.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct tidal-library perceptual signature (syllables siphoned, foam drawers) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in "keep, keep, keep." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I am all of them"); POV stable, lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "minnows of thought skittering" advances character/atmosphere). Metaphors cohere in tidal forge; no loops, varied rhythm flows read-aloud. Minor figurative density fits taught lyric pattern, pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tidal library as migrating id archive transforms identity trope via gear-heart routine; creel-words as fins/anchors synthesize organically. Risky lyric synthesis inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
