<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's embodied dance memory ("pivot on wet stone makes meaning") reveals contradictory exile impulses acting in the tattoo scene; final vocation shift earned via prior tidal anchors with cost of clandestine future.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to Charged Poise closure in "exile tilt into vocation"; orientation anchored early in littoral departure; cost legible in "garden accepted our offering" hush foreclosing safe harbors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's "scent and shadow keep no registries" constrains secretive verse; shoulder as micro-setting charges final image; sensory gaps (lantern gnats, leaf-star) mirror POV tidal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (verse vs. ban) signaled early, textural deepening in "shoulder became a sky" narrows to oath; agency in dot-pricking forces crystallization; future patrol cost felt in "gardener" disguise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of embodied memory emerges via gaps/lines motif shifting from contraband to "living stanza"; final "harbor that refuses walls" non-literally answers preservation question, reweighting ban's premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct tidal perceptual signature ("palm held low becomes a dam") modulates rhythmically to closure poise; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Your departures, my returns"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "the missing that makes a measure, the hush that carries a note" propels without loops; metaphors coherent via tidal pattern; no scaffold, varied rhythm charges basin tremble.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tide dancer inking lunar dust transforms exile trope into fresh "cosmic verse on mortal skin"; risk of lyric density heightens stakes, inevitable in "shoulder sing" hindsight.</comment>
