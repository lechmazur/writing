<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through inventive hands and embodied regret on ribs; contradictory impulses peak in visions of threads showing keeper's death versus transcendence, compelling earned renunciation. Final choice aligns with clock-maker's reverse grain, foreclosing path with felt cost of abandoned futures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery density builds radiance and visions to Charged Poise closure: "I let the yoyo climb, threads snuffing, and chose the keeper, the unbroken tide"—reconfigures stake with undeniable opportunity cost. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse arrival; single scene causality intact via yoyo puzzle to stone opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hunger stone and bone yoyo constrain choices (reverse gears align, blood drop opens seam); sensory details (salt sweat, wind under steps) filter through clock-maker bias, charging final wind of "orchards I had never planted." Atmosphere mirrors internal hunger, evolved causally with radiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transcend fate signaled early, tightens accumulatively via yoyo solve deepening to cost-laden visions (keeper's death thread), forcing renunciation agency. Escalation coheres under lens with one decisive cadence shift; moral calculus of threads forecloses options on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of rejecting clock-like fate for tidal connection emerges organically from reverse motifs and visions; final image reweights premise non-literally as "unbroken tide," lingering ambiguity of thin happiness without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like fossilized yoyo string.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature in reverse-time metaphors (cogs swim upstream) stable throughout; rhythmic modulation builds under pressure without leakage. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (radiance "climbing walls like fever seeking skin") propels accumulatively, no loops or scaffolds; minor overwrites in vision beat slightly muddle but pattern-consistent. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively to climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering yoyo puzzle transforms lighthouse trope into fresh synthesis of time/fate defiance; bold poetic risks (backward script, pulsing stone) heighten stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight to stasis choice.</comment>
