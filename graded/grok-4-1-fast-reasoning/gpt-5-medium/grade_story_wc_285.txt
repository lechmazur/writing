<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman's patient endurance and micro-choice to offer the needle compel the stitching pivot; Wren's palm steadying the ferry reveals relational crucible. Interiority particular via percolating thoughts and embodied sorrows-as-lumber. Minor abstraction in epiphanies like "warming the scars" slightly dilutes contradiction under climax pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to stitching and final reconfiguration; orientation anchored instantly at fog-bound crossing. Charged Poise closure in "palimpsest promise settle like a cloak" reweights fog-to-motion with felt scar-cost undeniable on page. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ferry current constrains midway turn, needle and sailcloth as micro-settings charge stitching choices. Sensory hierarchy (water slap, rope burr, rain-metronome) reflects coachman's ambient bias. Final hills "breathing" mirrors internal shift via evolved fog alleys.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distilling promise via crossing) tightens accumulatively in current opposition and stitching cadence. Agency in threading moonlight forecloses erasure path with scar-cost. Halfway current tests patience, forcing palm-steadying trade-off legible under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Palimpsest theme emerges via stitching over fear, not erasing; final cloak-image reconfigures braiding complexity without moral state. Subtext in Wren's "write over fear with motion" layers ambiguity. Resonance from particulars avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited perceptual signature (murmurs, eddies) biases noticing; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You look like rain"). Rhythm modulates with intensity, prose texture distinct. No head-hopping, elision pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short pierces vs. flowing oar). Heavy figurative in stitching beat ("threaded with wet strand of moonlight") borders overwrite but pattern-taught and closure-propulsive. Minor paraphrase echoes ("closely attentive") but no loops dulling end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ferry trope via needle-map braiding and palimpsest; fresh synthesis of weaving/percolation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric risks heighten stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
