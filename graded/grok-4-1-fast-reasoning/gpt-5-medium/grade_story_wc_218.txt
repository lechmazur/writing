<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between sorrow/work and death/remodel act in scene via copper wiring and grafting; final renunciation earned by causal buildup to "silence arrived not as absence but as trust," with embodied cost in tiring afternoons.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from wiring to otter ramps to closure's Charged Poise; orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "the island cared for me as I had cared for it, laying shade where my breath grew thin."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Living stone pillars constrain choices like shading seedlings and leaning for nests, charging final chord; sensory hierarchy via POV (hums, sighs, pollen taste) integrates purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remodel fostering respect vs. death) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via storms/otter integration tightening options; cost visible in lost branch and tiring, though minor abstractness in people interactions slightly dilutes peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of relationships as architecture emerges organically from grafting/council; final image reweights death as "returning to the woven map" without moralizing, resonating via particulars like kelp raft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in nature-as-alive diction ("pillars hummed...appetite"); stable first-person with rhythmic modulation under stress; no dialogue, but sparse group mentions cohere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "copper sang faintly, an insect choir corrected"; minor metaphor density in peak remodel beats, but no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of terminal remake with living pillars/otter council feels inevitable; risk in interspecies council heightens stakes organically, transforming death trope.</comment>
