<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses peak in hovering over console switch while feeling rope's "warm from the day, cold at the core," earning the bell-pull choice with relational cost via Reni's deference; voice distinction shines in Reni's brief, pragmatic interjections.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure at "corridor faltered, split, and sidled away as if embarrassed," reconfiguring storm as responsive with felt restraint cost versus sirens; orientation anchors immediately in sanctuary and solstice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via glue-dried rope and duct-river listening, charging final "rope settle, the splice holding"; anemometer "fluttered not wild but thoughtful" mirrors POV bias, vivid across senses without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—listen versus switch at zero hour—tightens via bell-pull agency, foreclosing siren path with on-page cost in "budget audits favor blaring decisiveness"; under Textural lens, density reweights to disciplined snow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of weather as "witness willing to bargain" emerges implicitly from bell's "clear vowel" altering storm, resonant final "tugged the rope once more, not to alert but to bless the dark" reweighting without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature anthropomorphizes weather ("winds braided themselves into thin harps," "clouds trudged like tired pilgrims"); stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically under pressure, no elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("pressure quarrels like hesitant handwriting") propels without loops; varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no artifacts dulling closure image of "snow arrived with a discipline."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm warning as patient bargaining with weather via bell over sirens feels inevitable; risk-taking in responsive-storm premise heightens stakes through poetic anthropomorphism without gimmick.</comment>
