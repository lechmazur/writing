<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular ("star pulse against my teeth"), motivation "thresh meaning from experience" drives micro-choices like warming the pen; contradictory impulses (array tug vs. pen repair) act simultaneously, earning the gentle unbending with visible cost of partial fix. Flaws like fatigue compound realistically without hedging. Final stance renunciation of heroics feels character-bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of anomaly images and reflections builds to Charged Poise closure in writing the nine ("proposing a duet"), reconfiguring past with legible cost ("not erasing, accompanying"); orientation anchored early ("listening well of Station Rursus"). Single scene with reflective shards coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pen as micro-setting constrains choice (unbent to write nine) and charges final image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific ("anomaly like smoke that forgot fire", "nearest star pulse against teeth"). Details tactile/lived-in, evolve with events (spine adjusts "by a hair"). No white-room; anomaly pressures throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix wrong-seed past) signaled early, tightens via realization of "snare of equivalences" forcing pen repair agency; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights with cost ("five safe tomorrows for one uneasy yesteryear"). Subtle deepening in marginal nine, but abstract stakes occasionally dilute visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of negotiation over erasure emerges organically via particulars (array as "choir that remembers", pen duet); final image ("past invited to sit differently") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting editing premise without moralizing. Subtext in "superstition is just a lover's name for the physics", ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("regretful starlight", "shivering weather") biased to interpreter's lens, rhythmic control modulates (short urgent strokes post-repair); Mara dialogue natural/subtextual ("unbending gently"), voices distinct. Stable first-person, no leakage; compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm ("It scratched out a nine that looked like a one"); metaphors coherent/voice-motivated ("blanket woven from echoes"), no loops or scaffolds despite density. Minor overwriting in reflective beats (e.g., repeated "contingent relationships") slightly dulls peak momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi lyricism (array edits via "tugging one thread", pen as storm-etched tool); risk-taking in poetic conceit heightens stakes (history as "negotiation with a choir"), feels inevitable. No derivatives; voice/ premise transform tropes organically.</comment>
