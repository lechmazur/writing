<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation as "creeping normality noticer" roots consistent traits in ritual micro-choices like placing the orris shard, earning the final agreement with embodied eavesdropping on scents; interiority particular and contradictory in "not a priest, but... sanctified enough to forgive."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of displacements and corrections builds to Charged Poise closure in "we have agreed to keep each other company," reconfiguring house's pose with legible cost in the settling hush and carried shards; orientation anchored early, one tightening via photo/crate discoveries suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Displaced objects as micro-setting constrain choices throughout (e.g., bowl's handspan shift dictates realignment) and charge final porch crate image; sensory details selectively POV-biased toward scents/drafts mirroring ritual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving house via noticing signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening discoveries (photo mismatch, weather bottles) narrowing interpretive options; agency in sanctifications forecloses displacement paths with cost in hush's brave settling and ongoing vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of houses as "conversations" with displaced cups as "raised hands" emerges organically from ritual actions, final image of lit corners offering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; complexity in forgiving misplacements lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "reading the house through displaced objects" biases noticing idiomatically; rhythmic control modulates hushed lyricism under ritual pressure, POV stable with purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in placements, longer in realizations); high density integrates image/action, but figurative density borders overwriting in peak ritual (e.g., "shard of hush... crouches") without obscuring closure; minor shard motif repetition pattern-taught, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noticing imperceptible shifts via object ritual transforms house-revival trope organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes of attention's cost, inevitable in hindsight via orris/hush reprise.</comment>
