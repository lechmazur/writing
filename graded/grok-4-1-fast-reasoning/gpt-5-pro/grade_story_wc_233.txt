<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Queen's contradictory rule ("without music") and dream-haunt impulses act in scene; "I unmake my unmaking" renunciation earned by gallery visions and palm costs, with mapmaker's witness adding relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as image density (starlight, exhales) tightens to gallery deepening; closure RR (wound pools to mirror, grottos breathe) lands on-page with circlet cost in "metal touched stone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto constrains exhale choice and charges door braid; ember ribs cool via palms, with sensory sheen/weep mirroring internal wound evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant dream-unravel stake deepens agency-driven via naming wedding fire, narrowing to stitching trade-off; palm cuts and circlet as unmistakable costs under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Disenchantment theme emerges from coronation hawk to unmaking vow, reweighting summons without moral; final wind breath offers resonant non-literal answer to dream mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("rain tests silk") biases details; brief dialogue distinct (mapmaker respectful), rhythmic modulation in breath-count peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "starlight braided itself into a door"; varied rhythm propels without figurative muddle, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grottos-as-lungs synthesis transforms queen trope via unmaking calculus; bold lyric risks (dream gallery) heighten stakes organically.</comment>
