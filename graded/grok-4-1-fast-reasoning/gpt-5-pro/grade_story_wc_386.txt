<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's wreck-diver ghost whisperer traits shine in embodied interiority like "child kept borrowing my pulse whenever I closed my eyes," driving motivation to salvage name with felt cost in promise; minor reflection lacks one anchoring micro-choice at revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to closure via globe's fog clearing to "Leda," a Conceptual Repricing reconfiguring salvage as name-carrying with conceptual cost of exposure; orientation anchored early in shrine entry, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glacier shrine's "ice thins to windows, moaning with locked wind" constrains revelation as faces bloom in ice, charging final starlight pour; sensory selection (candle bruise, smoke freezes) mirrors internal weave without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to salvage pure truth tightens texturally via dream analysis to name reveal, forcing endurance/commitment with legible cost in "promise to carry her name...expose the owner's lie"; one deepening suffices, agency in whispering/speaking name.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-raft emerges organically from weaving dreams to name, resonant in final "name that does not drown" reweighting erasure premise without moralizing; subtext in globe's "flakes looked like forgiveness" layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ghosts prefer threads to nets") and rhythmic modulation sustain single POV under pressure; girl's "voice is a bruise under my tongue" carries subtext, dialogue sparse but goal-driven at revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but minor overwrite in revelation metaphors ("wobbling star," "bandage made of light") risks muddle without obscuring closure; no loops, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-cameos and glacier shrine transforms ghost story into truth-salvage via "weave truth carefully from fragments"; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight at name-burn reveal.</comment>
