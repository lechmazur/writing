<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (whisper vs. Alder's horn preference) and final shoulder touch/eyes earn change via prior ritual causality with relational cost. Interiority concrete (cork to lips tasting bark) and micro-choices reveal values under pressure. Flaws balanced in gentle competence without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early (whispers gather intent) holds to Charged Poise closure in skiff's slow answer and Mara's pale exhaustion as felt cost. Single scene anchors orientation by para 2; one tightening via scent ritual suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lens and vial cork constrain beam/scent choices and charge final garden scent release; sensory hierarchy (salt lips, damp earth) reflects POV priorities. Details tactile/lived-in (wiping brass, hatch pour) evolve with dawn. Micro-setting as body/tool guides beckon without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers bring Mara) signaled para 1, tightens accumulatively via ritual density to skiff turn narrowing shout option. Agency in cork/whisper forecloses horn path with exhaustion cost legible on her face. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of whisper-gathered intent emerges organically, final "lullaby from the wrong century" reweights loud/soft premise non-literally with Alder's softening as conceptual cost. Subtext in silences/gestures; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in relief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (vibrations, scents as "patient yes") biases noticing; rhythmic syntax modulates from hum to soft break. Stable first-person, no head-hopping; dialogue sparse/natural (Alder coughs, grumbles) with subtext. Compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short hum note to long beam sentence), density high without loops; figurative coherent ("light takes whisper... shawl over newborn") taught as pattern. Minor density overload in ritual para but propels; no scaffold, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pseudo-magic lens/scent/whisper system transforms lighthouse trope organically; risk in lyric beckon heightens stakes. Non-obvious "bone of longing" inflection inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
