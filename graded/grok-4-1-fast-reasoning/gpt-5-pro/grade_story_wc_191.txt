<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maris's interiority shines in embodied nostalgia ("chest hurt with the nostalgia of a frontier") and micro-choices like shaving paint layers, revealing stubborn memory-keeping under pressure; final stewardship earns from prior causal buildup without tidy epiphany. Contradictory impulses act in scene via personal indulgence vs. emergency stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mural revelations and flake warmth build density to Charged Poise closure ("dawn answered; stewardship began"); on-page cost legible in foreclosed throne to algorithms and personal responsibility. Orientation anchored early; no shards, single progression coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard bark, paint curls, root-room sap veins constrain choices (e.g., scanner on fifth trunk reveals path) and charge final throne image; sensory hierarchy (static stars on skin, teeth-taste frequency) reflects lore-keeper bias. Micro-setting like ruby flake evolves as tactile anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (throne before sunrise) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via drone countdown and flake coordinates narrowing path; agency in climbing and palm-placement forecloses algorithmic rule with felt cost in hesitation whispers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship through antique listening emerges organically from murals, cassettes, radio-throne; final image reweights nostalgia-future tension without moralizing, resonant via "thrones require routes as much as crowns require pressure."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("colors tasted like childhood circuitry"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive entry to terse closure, POV stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ruby flake... warmed when I faced the correct layer"); figurative pattern consistent without muddle, but minor density overload in opening metaphors slightly dulls propulsion before peak. Zero loops, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of futuristic nostalgia in murals-as-antennae, throne-as-rain-radio; risk-taking in surreal imagery (waterfall windows, broadcast fruit) heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from grandmother's notches to stewardship.</comment>
