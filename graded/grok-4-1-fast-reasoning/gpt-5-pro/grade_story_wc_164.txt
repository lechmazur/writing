<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through "cheerful as a bruise" conjecture revealing values; embodied emotions in soot-glyph mapping and seed-singing; final promise earns reconfiguration with compromise cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure at bird-promise and cave-laugh reconfiguring paths; cost legible in "half visible, half song" balance; orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Geode cave constrains via disappearing paths and seed-pointing; glass and threads as micro-settings charge ghost-bridge choices; final ribbon image recharges quartz-seeds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (paths disappearing before memory fades) signaled early; escalation deepens accumulatively via conjecture-to-threads-to-bird chord narrowing to compromise agency; cost in foreclosed erasure felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of protective absence emerges organically from negative corridors and seed-songs; resonant non-literal answer in winking cave/ribbon without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature biases all to foam/memory glyphs; rhythmic modulation peaks in bird-chord hum; stable first-person lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (light grinning, cave sighing); rhythm varies in seed-sprouting acceleration; minor metaphor density risks opacity in heart-scene but no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of recollectionist, geode-paths, bird-seeds transforms memory trope; risk-taking in lyric elision heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
