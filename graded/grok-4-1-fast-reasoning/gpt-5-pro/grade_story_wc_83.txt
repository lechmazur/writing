<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between extraction demands and ghosts' needs peak in signing as "drone strike wedding survivor, unwilling to be a weapon," earning the renunciation with embodied cost like "taste iron." Interiority particular via trauma-tinged science; Liyun applies subtle crucible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure in "We publish the coordinates and lock the access," with legible cost ("institution will hate us by morning"). Orientation anchored early in observatory/mission; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Floating observatory and geode constrain choices, as crystal stabilizes readout "on the boundary" and anchors viewport at end, charging final image. Sensory selection vivid/POV-biased (winds gnaw, decks hum); salt flats mirror acceptance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map unused potential) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at "crater rim" discovery tying to trauma, forcing renunciation agency with cost ("ghosts want a place to sleep"). Pressure coheres to reweight options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of merciful refusal emerges organically from geode/pool particulars, resonating in final salt flats image reweighting "verdict" to "jury... unsure, awake" without moralizing. Subtext in implication/silence enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses lyric science-trauma ("geode... translates micro shudders into notes even trauma can read"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure to "bleak exhilaration lifts me." Stable first-person, minimal dialogue natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>High density/propulsion in lines like "adjust the damping to the edge of instability, balancing terror and precision like a wet blade"; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent/patterned for lyric payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perturbation theory as regret-mapping for survivor transforms trauma physics trope; risk in "hunt... minima" intensifies stakes organically to inevitable stasis refusal.</comment>
