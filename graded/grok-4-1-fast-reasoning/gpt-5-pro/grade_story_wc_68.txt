<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in rejecting factions while teaching children, earning the third-way choice; embodied in raw hands and isolation cost. Final endurance as sewer philosopher forecloses social paths with felt price. Voice-specific worldview via "philosophy drips downward" reveals flaws driving competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cog find to clock success, tightening via ledger discovery and teaching. Closure as Charged Poise in "time itself pressed a quiet finger to its lips," reconfiguring narratives with conceptual isolation cost. Orientation anchored early in sewer post-plague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sewer capillaries, silted safe, oysters on lathes constrain dives and salvage, filtering via philosopher's bias. Recurring silt/sediment charges final image of bedrock ceiling. Sensory hierarchy (tactile rust, oil scabs) mirrors internal rebellion without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rebuild time against factions escalates accumulatively via vault find and child-teaching, narrowing to self-reliant success. Agency in "third way" renunciation forecloses alliances with raw-hand cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of action over narrative emerges organically via cog/ledger, reweighted in quiet city silence answering preservation question. Final image "brass and salt and absence of applause" resonates without moralizing. Complexity in rejecting both factions lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tide argues with bricks," rhythmic syntax modulates from abrasive dives to poised end. Stable first-person POV biases toward philosophical grit; purposeful compression teaches pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors cohere (teeth, scabs, slurry) without muddle in peak build. No loops; propulsion via image-propelled sentences like "clocks listen back." Minor fig density fits lyric voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague sewer philosopher rebuilding time transforms tropes via lived silt/gears. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes; "teach the water how to listen" inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
