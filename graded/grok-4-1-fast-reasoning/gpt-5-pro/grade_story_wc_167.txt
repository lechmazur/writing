<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glazier's motivation to illuminate the mundane drives concrete micro-choices like pond ritual and pane-tilting, earning harbor master's shift with embodied patience over direct speech; contradictory impulses (tongue "better with putty than petitions") act in scene, revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (ripples, light spectra) tightens to reweight preservation stake; Charged Poise closure lands on-page when harbor master concedes "plans could bend" after ledger light underlines unmet promises, with legible cost of demolition averted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism atrium and lily pond constrain choices (light raking floor, rings forecasting argument), charging final overlapping ripples; sensory details (fog "trumpet[ing] up ribs," beam sampling "fish scales, boots") filter through glazier bias, evolving with mist breaking into sun.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atrium's value vs. demolition) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via light on ledger exposing "promise to rehire," narrowing options; agency in tilting pane forces harbor master's stance crystallization with felt cost to forgotten "softened edges."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mercy in breakage emerges organically from pane repair and light revealing debts, resonant in final pond rings "like smiling lips" reweighting demolition threat without moralizing; counter-reading (stubborn vs. practical) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reads between lines most people call seams") biases noticing patterns, syntax/rhythm modulates from hushed openings to light-amplified peaks; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You commune with it"), advances persuasion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (light "spill[ing] colors across his ledger") consistent/pattern-taught via glass motif, propelling to closure without loops; minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwriting but pays off in spectrum persuasion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier rituals/ripples transforming demolition trope into light-ledger reckoning feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric voice heightens stakes, non-obvious angle on preservation via "glass makes mercy visible."</comment>
