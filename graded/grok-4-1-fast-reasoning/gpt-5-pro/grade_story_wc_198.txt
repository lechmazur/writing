<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (past desire for applause vs. present refusal) act in scene via recalled near-failure, earning final renunciation of tone for hush with embodied cost in damp horn and ongoing duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure: prophecy stutters into bubbles, droplets adopt tempo; cost legible in "damp with fog and effort" and prophecy's seasonal return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains whisper tactic ("fits the atrium's prism") and charges final beam image ("brushes the floor like a hand blessing"); sensory hierarchy musical/embodied (breath nests, feathers felt).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (hush code's town/river/child doom) signaled early, deepens texturally as code "prie[s] it open" forcing silence shepherding; agency in breath-shaping forecloses prophecy with damp effort cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "quietly vivid ledger of mercy" reweights negative space as power, emerging from vested hush vs. code without statement; ambiguity in prophecy's nap invites lingering reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature via musical bias ("keys a moon scale," "groove inside out") rhythms pressure, stable first-person with purposeful compression paying off in closure hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "whisper a note that is mostly air" multi-job); figurative pattern (hush/code/mist) coherent/voice-motivated, no loops, varied rhythm through peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sax-silence vs. prophecy transforms mystic trope via negative space method; fresh synthesis inevitable in "empty frame home," bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
