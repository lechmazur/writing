<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—wolf-legacy alarms vs. hush-chasing quiet—act in scene via lattice use and path-speaking; final renunciation of cries for work-inheritance earned by causal buildup, with felt cost in choosing obscurity over easy belief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of hush-patterns building to CR closure at "When it paused, the missing breathed," reweighting premise (hush feeds on certainty) with conceptual cost of laborious truth; orientation anchored in opening line, one tightening from listening to speaking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lattice as recurring tool constrains climax choice ("set the lattice... into the path of the beam") and charges final image of returned breath; sensory details (copperlight, brine jars, boot scuffs) filter through POV bias, mirroring internal hunt without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trap hush to return missing before bodies found) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via revelation ("hush fed on certainty") forcing tactic shift to speaking path; agency in endurance tightens options, with live cost in "before they find the bodies" urgency charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-work emerges implicitly from wolf-inheritance conflict and hush-predation, reweighted non-literally in final image ("copperlight repose dress our shoulders like blankets") without moralizing; particulars like lattice-squares knitting voice create resonant ambiguity on lazy belief's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("surf wrote instructions in foam," "scuffs... curled hieroglyphs") biases toward patterned silences; rhythmic control modulates from patient hovering to declarative close, with stable first-person distance inferring limits plausibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "The lens turned, slow as a heart made of clockwork salt, casting copperlight repose"; zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels via image-stacking without muddle in peak beam-lattice beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms cry-wolf myth into hush-labyrinth predation via lighthouse logic, with risky lyric accumulation heightening stakes; non-obvious turn ("thread a labyrinth with your own story") feels inevitable from scuff-reading particulars.</comment>
