<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in confession ("loved the ringmaster more than breath or water"), embodied shame ("tasted metallic, like biting a battery"), earning unafraid stasis with exposure cost; advisor as pressure reveals flaw-driven blindness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (mirrors, photos) builds to CR closure ("he had never been a ghost, only the last trick of fear") with legible cost in unraveled shadow; oriented early in funhouse post-resuscitation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mirrors with "mold freckles" constrain photo tactics and multiply protagonist into crowd at climax; sensory hierarchy (rotten peppermint, wet paper) biases via curse, evolving to charge final dust image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear via curse) signaled early, agency escalates in unbosom/photo ("set the timer and turned sideways"), tightening via fear's manifestation forces trade-off with shame cost unmistakable in emptied outline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of exposure emptying fear emerges via particulars (curse prints hunter, confession bleeds poison); final "forty thin smiles I no longer needed" resonates as non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("lungs still tasted of river coins") stable in first-person, rhythmic modulation under stress ("fear came quickly, graceful as mildew"); elision (advisor's nature) pays off in CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("shutter clicked... booth yawned open"), varied rhythm; minor figurative density in peak ("patient needle... stitches") coherent via taught pattern, no loops obscuring shadow unravel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Surreal curse-photo trap synthesizes carnival decay and confession into inevitable CR; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, transforming haunted return into unafraid poise.</comment>
