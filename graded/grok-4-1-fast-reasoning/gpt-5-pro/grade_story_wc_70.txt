<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's truthfulness trait constrains pivotal choice to reveal riddle over coins, embodied in "wire in my throat that hums"; contradictory impulses act when offered coins but compelled by lightning's gift. Mara's engineer frown reveals distinct voice and pressure. Final endurance of truth forecloses easy path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: riddle reveal tightens to harp discovery, bee hum mounting reconfigures stakes to Charged Poise closure as tower sings and drones return. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in tower post-blackout. Cost legible in "risking this" vs. coins, final image reweights wonder preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower base seam and copper harp constrain reveal and fix; lacquer box glow charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy via POV: "honeyed and smoky" sky mirrors nectar dusk motif. Details tactile and selective, evolving with drafts from wings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone failure starves gardens) signaled early, deepens via overtraining reveal to bee hum fix under textural lens. Agency in mounting coil forecloses algorithmic routine with cost of wild music risk. Pressure coheres to crystallization in Mara's cliff-edge laugh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wonder vs. routine emerges via riddle-to-hum arc, reweighted in final "preserve wonder in routine" without statement—image of tower flame answers. Subtext in poetry over firmware; ambiguity lingers in "maybe it did."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("speech exited me involuntarily truthful") biases noticing toward poetry; rhythm modulates from nectar dusk calm to trembling tines climax. Dialogue subtextual: Mara's "You could have lied" pursues status shift. Stable distance, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: "glow curled toward a hairline seam" advances plot/atmosphere; metaphors coherent (bee hum in brass charges closure). Varied rhythm, no loops; read-aloud propulsion peaks at "tines began to tremble."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi (drone bees, lightning tower) with lyric truth-poetry; risk in poetic voice transforms tollbooth trope. Riddle-to-hum turn inevitable from world logic; no derivative echoes.</comment>
