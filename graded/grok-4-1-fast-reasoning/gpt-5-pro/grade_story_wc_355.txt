<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eclectic pacifist's interiority shines in embodied tremors and patient tunings, with contradictory impulses of curiosity versus restraint acting simultaneously; final renunciation of words earns stasis via prior gentle causality. "Hands tremble like stage curtains" reveals character under pressure without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silences densify to clasp opening (DC/RR), reconfiguring options with cost of restraint over force; continuous scene anchors orientation early. "The clasp simply opens" lands closure with legible unimportance cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop constrains tuning choices tactilely (coils hum, needle traces); fennel patch charges final image, mirroring internal restraint. Sensory hierarchy favors auditory absences, biasing toward pacifist priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover silence non-violently) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via numbered silences and loosening; agency in tuning forecloses force with patience cost. Clasp warming narrows options legibly under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Empathy path emerges implicitly via fennel insight ("world is edible, not only flammable"), reweighting silences amid fireworks without moralizing; final image offers resonant CR to premise. Complexity lingers in appetite beneath harm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature personifies silences idiosyncratically ("hush of metal asked a kind question"); first-person distance stable, rhythmic modulation heightens textural pressure. Voice as character reflects pacifist sincerity throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythms and multi-job lines; figurative pattern taught early pays off at closure without muddle. Minor density risks overwriting in descriptive peaks, but voice-motivated coherence preserves clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious premise synthesizes pacifism, silences, and frequencies into inevitable textual payoff; fennel transforms fireworks trope boldly. Risky lyric risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
