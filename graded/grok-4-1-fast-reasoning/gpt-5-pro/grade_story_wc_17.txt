<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between doubt and legacy compel the recharting choice; interiority embodied in chalking veins and humming the negative, earning the mercy shift with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as echo density tightens to corridor revelation; closure as "corridor closed itself like healed skin" delivers RR/Charged Poise with legible cost of releasing trapped memory, orientation anchored early in passage and museum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Film negative as recurring tool constrains choices (held to eye/ear) and charges final tuck-in; tiles and fireplace integrate tactilely, mirroring internal states through sound-biased perception without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of dream-mapping escalates texturally via montage to secret release; agency in asking wall and recharting forecloses entrapment path with felt sigh-cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of merciful mapping emerges implicitly from particulars; final "mercy echoes best" reconfigures legacy without moralizing, resonant via wall's sigh and lighter burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-choreography ("footsteps bloomed"); rhythmic control modulates from doubt to poise, stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful sonic metaphors; minor figurative density in peak revelation beat slightly risks overwrite but pattern-taught and legible, no loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Echo cartography premise synthesizes climate/memory fresh; risk in lyric montage heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from negative's evolution.</comment>
