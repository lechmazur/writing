<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like balancing "science and song" during the tug of the island's census, earn a meaningful endurance at closure; villagers feel generic without crucible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building through dream harvests to seed planting and treaty recital; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in sapling burst and monsoon with legible cost of chosen release: "washing only what we chose to release."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridge, shells, and sink constrain choices (e.g., hollow for planting, water answers names) and charge final sapling image; sensory selectivity (pandan silence, reef clicks) filters through POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory protection tightens via thunder-accelerated rite and treaty under accumulative lens; agency in recitals forecloses splintering with felt cost of departures and enduring doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reality as "our most careful fiction" emerges organically from particulars like ink-veins and tasted contradictions; final bite offers resonant repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "luminous doubt that guides us toward a fidelity larger than proof" modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax; figurative language consistent and voice-driven without muddle in peak monsoon beat, though occasional elevation borders overwriting elsewhere.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empirical myth-checking transforms tropes via seed-root and reef treaty; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at audit-complete linger.</comment>
