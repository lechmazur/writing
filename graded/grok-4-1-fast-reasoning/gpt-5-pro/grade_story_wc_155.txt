<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to rediscover joy roots in grandmother's film and intensifies through fog's threat, earning the renunciation of hoarding with embodied cost in laughter echoing like a swinging gate. Contradictory impulses—save versus share—act simultaneously in the display and blur decisions. Interiority particular via light-painting and marmalade baiting; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images builds to CR closure where blurring the display reprices joy as contagious, with conceptual cost legible in "slipped the fresco fragment beneath the roots" and rewound film's promise. Continuous scene anchors early (orchard district by para 1), no orientation debt. One tightening: fog bleaching forces spending joy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fog, branches, and crate constrain choices (e.g., projector balance, fog as canvas bleaching film) and charge final image of contagious joy. Sensory hierarchy vivid and POV-biased: fog laps silvering film, network hums through roots. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy, not ache-museum) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fog's ambition bleaching the reel, forcing agency in deliberate blur and release. Cost unmistakable in foreclosed hoarding path, reweighting options in "spend it until the coin sings." One deepening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared/exposed joy emerges organically from particulars like projected laughter and jam recipe on film leader, culminating in resonant CR without moralizing: "displayed it long enough to be contagious." Subtext in grandmother's wink invites ambiguity; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing ("fog applauded in damp thuds," "pearls with their own projected shadows"); rhythmic control modulates from setup to pressured blur. Stable single POV, no elision or head-hopping; prose as character reflects artist's light-weaving mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fog is a patient audience, an emulsion waiting for light"); metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (fog as darkroom, bruised pear). No loops, scaffolds, or muddle; rhythm varies, propels to closure image unscathed. Minor figurative density in peak beat contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting memories in fog-bound orchard transforms loss trope via knowledge network and contagious joy CR; risk-taking in sustained lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration ("joy... left on a tree") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
