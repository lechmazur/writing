<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between euthanasia pull and harbor learning act in scene through postponements; final renunciation earned by embodied micro-choices like coaxing the photo with parasol tip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with early orientation to marina and tourism; closure as earned stasis in final postponement reconfigures stake, cost legible in "fold in patience deepening" as conceptual shelter with deferred ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains trawling choices and charges sounds like "crack leapt with a violin's mercy"; parasol tip as micro-setting enables photo rescue, mirroring loose grip.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning endings accumulates texturally via discoveries (crate tapes, splitting ice, boy saved); one decisive deepening forces stance crystallization in postponement with cost of sustained waiting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of endings' frequencies emerges from particulars like pilings' "grainy aches" and ice hum; final image offers non-literal resonance by reweighting euthanasia premise through "harbor grammar."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic details (gulls "stitched windborne solace," ice "nudging cleats"); stable first-person voice modulates rhythm with emotional poise, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via motifs like "fold in patience"; minor figurate density in reflective peaks (e.g., "floe pressed... hummed like a throat") risks slight opacity but teaches pattern early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourist learning death sounds via ice trawling synthesizes fresh angle on endings; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
