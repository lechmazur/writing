<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of caution and daring act in scene via early arrival and code-writing, earning the final repair choice with cost tied to the "burn" scars. Interiority concrete and embodied in "heartbeats against the soft percussion of thawing drops." Final endurance/renunciation of past failures compels higher-stakes repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density tightens from codes to radio fix as DC/RR, with cost in "use your burn to fix the breakers" legible in final soldering beat. Orientation anchored early in bluff/mist/pillbox. Single scene coheres causally to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow and bark constrain code-writing choice; pillbox/fern engraving charges final coil reveal/image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (scars smoothed by wind, thawing drops). Hut as micro-setting evolves tactilely to enable repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via courage/fixing) signaled early, tightens via man's reveal narrowing to radio task with agency in repair. Cost unmistakable in "burn that marked you erased your tether" forcing trade-off. Escalation accumulates under lens to foreclose inaction path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fixing broken emerges organically via pillbox/radio/scar motifs, reweighting premise in final "breathed until it spoke" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like fern veins as code/inventory. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature in "silver hush" and fern-curling veins; voice modulates rhythmically under stress (short sentences in repair). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via "prudently daring." No head-hopping, stable distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload ("smiled like a bruise remembering its color") borders muddle in opening beats without full pattern payoff. No loops/scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully to closure. Clean mechanics, vivid specificity replaces generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh poetic synthesis of spy thriller with lyric repair motif; pillbox coil as non-obvious turn inevitable in hindsight. Transforms tropes via "unused courage waits inside the static." Bold voice risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
