<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to become visible roots every choice, from pipe chase uncovering to stepping out visible; interiority particular via sense memory, embodied in "cupped it and felt the faint burr." Contradictory shyness and action peak earned in "I step from the pipe door," foreclosing isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory currents builds to Charged Poise closure when Mara listens with narrator, reconfiguring visibility with felt tenderness cost in "names are tender now." Orientation anchors immediately in library dawn; one tightening via caching tape narrows shy isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shadowed library constrains via pipe chases and atlas case hiding spots, charging final image as lamps steady post-listening. Sensory hierarchy (brass breath, blue lamps) filters through narrator's crawl-space bias; micro-setting like "threaded screw" enables pivotal cache.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of visibility tightens accumulatively when tape cache draws Mara, forcing narrator's emergence; agency in patient archaeology yields micro-turn to shared listening. Cost legible in shy exposure: "I am not a ghost, only shy architecture," charging poise without full resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of archived tenderness emerges via particulars like tape sliver and sense murmurs, reweighting invisibility in final shared hush without moralizing. Resonance from "visibility can be a hand placed where needed" ties to closure image of steady lamps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "smell a reagent and know a chemist weeps" biases noticing; voice rhythm modulates from crawl intimacy to exposed poise. Stable single POV with purposeful compression; sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in Mara's "You found it."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "I carry the fragment in my cheek like a coin"; rhythmic variety in short coughs of lamps mirrors tension. Motif repetition (sapphire hush) taught early, pays off without loops; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crawl-space dweller as shy architecture transforms library trope into fresh sensorium; risk of lyric density heightens stakes of visibility without opacity. Final reconfiguration of hush into connection feels inevitable from pipe-born particulars.</comment>
