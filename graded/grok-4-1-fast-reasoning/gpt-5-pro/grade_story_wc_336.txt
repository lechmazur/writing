<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pruner's interiority embodied in listening to branches and naming hurts during cuts; contradictory impulses in offering succor to Gray despite its pall reveal mercy over invention. Final teaching of neighbors earned by prior crossings and plantings with communal cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like insatiable creativity steadied by charge complicate gentle pruning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of pruning/gathering essences builds density to bridge-crossing tightening, culminating in RR closure via seed-planting that reconfigures Gray from threat to visitor with felt famine cost. Orientation anchored in first line; no shards, causality holds poetically without breaks. Cost legible in "seed shuddered, then threw out a root like a silver thread."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (mist cupped, roots shivering) constrains choices like thinning canopy to open foam-door. Parapet/orchard mirrors internal restoration, evolving with exhalations; body/tools (shears, hook) tactile and lived-in. Final branches arcing over parapet charge closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. Gray) signaled early, tightens texturally via echo-orchard pruning and Gray confrontation; agency in offering glass/cup forecloses malice path with hunger-price. Escalation coherent under lens, cost unmistakable in Gray's trembling edges unclenching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of merciful tending emerges from pruning rituals and Gray's revealed famine, not statements; final seed-growth offers non-literal answer reweighting Gray as story-needer. Resonance from particulars like pearl-scents, no moralizing; ambiguity lingers in Gray's visits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature (branches whisper, bees hum keys); rhythmic lyric voice modulates from hush to glittering, purposeful compression taught early. Minimal dialogue (to Gray, bees) goal-driven/subtextual; no head-hopping, diction biased to essences/colors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm mirroring pruning cadence; purposeful figural pattern (braiding, weaving) coherent without muddle. Minor fig-density in peak bridge-cross but pays off; no loops, scaffold—repetitive "pruning" pattern-taught and advances texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fable/pruning-as-magic transforms Gray trope via essence-capture mercy; risk-taking in textural lens heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from seed-charge to communal teaching; no derivatives, bold perceptual orchard-world.</comment>
