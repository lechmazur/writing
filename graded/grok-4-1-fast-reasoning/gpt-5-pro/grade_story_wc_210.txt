<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alchemist's motivation intensifies through embodied rejection of wishes, shown in chalking erased plans and shivering without prayer; internal conflict between ease and effort acts in micro-choices like using memory alone. Final communal shift earned by prior solitary endurance. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like isolation complicate but drive purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from bottle discovery to cliff-map projection; charged poise closure with women's arrival reconfigures solo revival, cost felt in "refusing shortcuts." Orientation anchored in opening lines; one tightening via lens suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cove's tide erases plans, constraining memory-use tactic; amber bottle and lanterns project streets, charging cliff-map final image. Sensory details (pebbled strand, shivering world) filtered through alchemist's revival bias. Evolving environment mirrors internal discipline.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of effort-based revival signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bottle-lens and women's joining; agency in endurance forecloses wish-path, cost visible in "hands keep moving" amid absence and storms. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of effort over wishcraft emerges via shifting bottle image (container to lens) and street names for verbs; final "civilization conceived at weather's lip" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications lingers complexly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in geometric light-noticing; rhythmic prose modulates hush to "softest applause." Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Tomorrow... we keep accounts"); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short declarative peaks amid lyric flow); purposeful light motifs taught early without muddle or loops. Closure image "map... steadies like a heartbeat" propels cleanly; no scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unopenable bottle-as-lens transforms revival trope into disciplined geometry; streets named "Measure, Temper" and "Tone: None" rule offer fresh, inevitable synthesis. Risky flat-poetic voice heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
