<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchestra copyist traits compel micro-choices like annotating lyrics with metronome symbols and bowing an E to animate dust, earning communal shift; embodied luminosity in hands reveals inheritance under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising from solo copying to communal humming and stranger's violin; CR closure lands on-page in "the dust would not need her" reweighting premise with obsolescence cost, charged by final tuning image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember alcove and dust powder constrain choices (ash/chalk stirred, blown to form figures) and charge final repose; recurring mist/radio glow filters through copyist's musical perception, mirroring internal states via phosphor hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to revive stories post-famine tightens accumulatively via signal falter forcing unshawled reply and patrol evasion, narrowing exposure options; agency in tapping reply bears felt risk as boots pass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stories reclaiming silence emerges organically from dust figures and communal parts; final image of dust sleeping "as if taught by kindness" reconfigures revival's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses musical idiom (intervals, tempos, cadences) with dust phenomenology; rhythmic control modulates from hushed phosphor to storm of strings under stress, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (dust as herd animals, river as brass ribbon) propels without loops; syntax varies for ear, clarity intact even in peak patrol beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical notation animating dust post-famine feels inevitable; risk in lyric compression heightens communal stakes, transforming tropes via phosphor inheritance and pirate riddles.</comment>
