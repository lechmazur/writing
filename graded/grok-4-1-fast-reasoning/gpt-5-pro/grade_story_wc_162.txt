<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied observations like "my shadow slants over the fields like a broken sundial," revealing stubborn love and reconciliation; minor slip in epiphanic closure feels slightly abstract despite prior buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through alignments (logbook holes to grain); closure CR lands on-page in "letting the distance step into me," reweighting premise with emotional cost of understanding father's intent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism terrace and wood grain constrain discoveries (light through holes maps paths), charging final image of maze as initials; selective sensory hierarchy (light, hush, grain currents) mirrors perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred thresholds) signaled early, tightens via deepening alignments forcing stance on distances; cost legible in crossing frame, foreclosing isolation with felt reconciliation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges organically from crossings and images, resonant CR in "sacredness is not magic, it is attention stretched across..."; final open frame reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fractured diction ("light scattered into shards," "hush fractures further"); stable first-person, rhythmic modulation peaks at crossing without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (vortex rings, featherly) taught early, propels to closure; minor overwriting in dense metaphors near desk scene but no muddle or loops dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze, pilot logs, and grain-map via prisms transforms loss trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight at cedar frame crossing.</comment>
