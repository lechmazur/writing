<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the negotiation, with Mara's regret embodied as a "dropped wrench" compelling the memory payment; final renunciation of hoarding earns closure without tidy epiphany. Voice specificity elevates interiority through scavenger idiom like "threaded meanings."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as story density builds via wheel-clicked echoes to Charged Poise closure in "the carousel shudders... resumes motion," with legible cost in the paid vow echoed by the lagoon. Single scene anchors orientation early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lagoon foam constrains collecting and charges final "question mark written in spray"; selective sensory hierarchy (ears tickled by dust, lilies shiver) mirrors Mara's confusion without catalog. Fantasy rules consistent via action, no spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restart vs. grind) signaled early tightens accumulatively through story-stitching and tribute demand, forcing agency in vow forfeiture; cost unmistakable in "regret loosen... heavy as a dropped wrench" altering options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories/regret reshaping rhythm emerges organically from wheel beats, reweighted non-literally in ghost's nod and lagoon's reprise of the vow; ambiguity lingers in "muscle deciding to flex" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual bias (ripples as echoes, ghost's "out-of-order eyes") and rhythmic modulation under stress; ghost dialogue matches idiom seamlessly as self-extension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors coherent under lyric pattern (e.g., "silence has weight"); no loops or muddle obscures "paddles catch bright air" closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ghost-as-self negotiation via story-plucking wheel transforms regret trope into fresh fantasy calculus; risk of dense poetry heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in vow-payment synthesis.</comment>
