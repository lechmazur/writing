<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guardian's vow roots motivation in inheritance and silence, compelling micro-choices like steadying the mirror during surfacing; embodied calm and passing the mirror earn a credible endurance with cost to verbal connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as light/shutter patterns densify to pattern break (hand surfaces), delivering Charged Poise closure in "mirror... ticking against my ribs" and "night hum with patience"; cost legible in unforced vow at "nothing was forced".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt dock constrains stair/arch movement and wet-grain light path; dental mirror as micro-setting charges final pocket tick, with sensory hush/ripples filtering through guardian's quiet bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent rescue of brother) signaled by boy's gesture, tightens texturally when shutters sequence + stitched light forces surfacing; agency in weaving forecloses verbal option with vow cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silent teaching theme emerges from light-weaving particulars, reweighted non-literally in "city lighter by one lesson" final image answering value-of-stars premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (absence as hum/instrument) modulates rhythmically, taught early in canal hush; stable first-person focalization biases to light/shutter patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion (short peak sentences at "hand surfaced first"); dense figuratives pattern-taught as lyric weave without muddle or loops obscuring rescue clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh non-verbal rescue via inherited mirror/shutters transforms silence trope, with spiral-weaving risk heightening stakes inevitably to humming closure.</comment>
