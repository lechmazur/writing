<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "What I wanted was simple... What I needed was narrower," earning the shift from rescue to rendezvous; embodied traits like "fingers trusted" arithmetic reveal character under pressure without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds reversal motifs to Charged Poise closure in final image of feeding regrets, with cost legible in "Every night I fed it a year from my hoard"; orientation anchored early, pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hunger stone constrains choices ("fitted the lens so the beam would fall into the stone's throat") and charges closure ("sat with the hunger stone thrumming"); sensory details like "slick weed curled" filter through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to step beyond fate tightens accumulatively at yoyo twist ("time slowed"), forcing trade-off obeyance with cost in ongoing regret-feeding; agency in binding yoyo forecloses howling lens path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sidestepping fate emerges organically from reversal images, reweighted non-literally in "Not returned, but redirected"; complexity lingers in bleak costs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic phrases like "gearing teeth kissing backward" modulates with intensity; stable first-person POV biases noticing (tides as arithmetic) without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with lines like "Light did not explode; it withdrew" doing image/rhythm/advancement; purposeful figurative pattern (reversals, breathing) taught early pays off at closure, no loops or drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yoyo-puzzle reversal transforms lighthouse trope into inward-time mechanic; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in "clocks honest in reverse."</comment>
