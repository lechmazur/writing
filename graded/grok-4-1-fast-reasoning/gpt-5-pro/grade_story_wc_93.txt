<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Precognitively cursed visions create contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("a thousand versions of my hands shivering"), earning the final shared hold with her as credible endurance; interiority concrete and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns densify to Charged Poise closure ("the path holds... I let go of the bowl, and it does not flee"), with felt fragile cost legible in final image; orientation anchored early in dawn/sea/eel herder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Painted rocks and driftbone bowl constrain choices (sequences guide eels/dust) and charge final shine; sensory hierarchy (salt taste, eel skins on feet) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise, hold shore) signaled early and deepens via eels braiding/road rising under lens, forcing endurance trade-off; cost unmistakable in "fragile logic" of borrowed dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patterns/promises binding chaos emerges organically from rock sequences to final "math we asked the sea to speak," reweighting premise without statement; resonant ambiguity in fragile hold.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hum the numbers until they taste like salt") and rhythmic control modulate with pressure; stable single-POV, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("eels... threading the sequences like dark needles"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle in peak dust-thrum beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-friction math-magic (primes/Fibonacci spelling name) transforms tropes inevitably; risk-taking in lyric patterns heightens stakes to charged final image.</comment>
