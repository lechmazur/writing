<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like pressing the echo stone to ice, reveal character-specific expertise; earned shift from mistaking quiet for absence to lattice culminates cleanly in pact with beings, satisfying 9+ test without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to hush bloom and shared purpose reveal; on-page RR closure ("the path stepped forward to be walked") carries felt cost of past mistakes and pact, legible in drum convergence; orientation anchored instantly, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains pivotal choices, e.g., polite lamp avoids stalactite fall, ice cracks dictate path; recurring ice drum charges climax image; sensory hierarchy (taste metal/snow, tones like iron remembering fire) POV-specific and purposeful, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find quiet pre-crush) signaled early, textural escalation via hush thickening forces collaborative tuning; agency in setting stone on drum forecloses solo path with cost of vulnerability to beings, unmistakable in "reluctant, then willing" vibrations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet as enabling lattice emerges organically from hush bloom and memory thaw, reweighting premise in final "weather that loved us" image without moralizing; complexity in shared alien hunger avoids binaries, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cave writes with fracture," "hush... petal by petal") with rhythmic control modulates intensity; stable single POV, purposeful compression legible under lyric pattern; no head-hopping, elision pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hush gathered until it carried a fragrance like frost bitten thyme, bringing memory in from the cold"); zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels to closure; figurative language pattern-taught without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cave cartography via ripple/ice script and hush as active force feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in collaborative alien tuning, transforming tropes without gimmickry; irreplaceable conceptual integrity.</comment>
