<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Samira's contradictory impulses—craving dedication yet prioritizing somatic safety—act simultaneously in the pivot to the glasshouse, earning the final placement of the photograph with visible relational cost against the chair. Embodied emotions via flinches and breath tides avoid therapy-speak. Quiet talent constrains bold action, revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of weather, flinches, and whispers builds to Charged Poise closure in the pearl niche, reconfiguring oversight as knotted realism with cost in endured storm and smoothed photo. Orientation anchored early in arboretum-cliff. One tightening via bench pivot suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cliff cracks and spray constrain overlook abandonment, charging final glasshouse image; glass ribcage and eucalyptus whispers mirror internal tides through Samira's biased notice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to drone hum and foam under crisis. Micro-setting (pearl basin) guides ceremony choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (realism vs. donor drama) signaled early, tightens via email-weather-drone sequence forcing glasshouse renunciation with chair's smile-cost. Escalation accumulates texturally, agency in somatic pivots foreclosing overlook path. Moral calculus between applause and sea sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hope-rope knotted to somatic shore markers emerges organically from photo ballast and pearl image, offering non-literal resonant answer in final niche without moralizing. Complexity lingers in grit-pearl ambiguity. Final hush-with-edges reweights premise with conceptual endurance cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (body as tide-chart, wind leaning glass) biases notice consistently; sparse dialogue indirection advances via "listening to it." Rhythm modulates with storm peak compression. Stable close-third POV, no head-hopping; elisions taught early pay off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "skin pulled tight in familiar flinch" does image-action-embodiment sans loops or scaffolds. Metaphors cohere (pearl/grit, rope/wind-test); rhythm varies read-aloud, no template cadence. Figurative layering purposeful in accumulative mode, clarity intact at niche beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma-arboretum-cliff fuses drone survivor with lighthouse void and pearl stillness, transforming tropes via somatic rope realism. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; final gull-sea-chest triad inevitable in hindsight, no derivative hedging.</comment>
