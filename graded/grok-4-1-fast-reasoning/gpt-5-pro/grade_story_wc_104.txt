<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chained liberator's motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy and chain's promise drives micro-choices like chaining to bench, earning shift from solo theft to shared apprenticeship; contradictory impulses (impede vs. share) act in climax confrontation. Internal conflict embodied in "staggering grace" descent and pocketed seeds. Final renunciation of exclusive liberation feels compelled by prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrow discovery → key decoding → vault access → self-chaining forecloses Collectors' easy victory with legible cost ("cannot lift the bench without lifting me"). Single scene anchors orientation early ("morning when the wall comes down"); closure as Charged Poise in shared climb reconfigures antagonism. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Piano bench constrains climax chaining and charges final hesitation; sensory details like "old syrup, solder" and "dank stair" filter through POV urgency, mirroring internal resilience. Carnival setting guides decode action via keys/tickets. Final vault "tin stamped with a river" reweights drought premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure plantable seeds) signaled early tightens causally via Collectors' approach forcing self-chain agency; cost visible in "heavy with debt and inconvenient with history." Escalation peaks in confrontation where sharing forecloses hoarding path. Moral calculus between archive and plant crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "freedom is not the absence of chains but the choice of what we bind ourselves to" emerges implicitly via notes and seed-sharing; final image of packets in palms offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Recurring chain/seed motifs shift from personal burden to communal act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice ("bricks thud like heavy applause") with perceptual bias (strategic patience notices ticket fletching hum) stable in single POV; late dialogue natural/subtextual ("our work is not to archive but to apprentice"). Rhythm modulates from deliberate to urgent climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hook my chain to the bench leg so nobody can drag me away" advances action/foreshadow); varied rhythm propels via short peak sentences ("There it is, faint as a swallow's apology"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; purposeful figurative consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival vault hiding drought-proof seeds under piano, transformed by chained protagonist's logic into communal binding; risk-taking in poetic conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final "we climb together" turn inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
