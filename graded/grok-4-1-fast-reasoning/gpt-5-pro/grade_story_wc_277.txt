<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Heiress's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (giddy fear amid duty) driving micro-choices like placing the pen nib; final intervention earns change via family legacy and moral calculus. Kline and technician apply targeted pressure, revealing her through evasion-handling. Voice specificity via newsprint metaphors distinguishes her fully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journalist call → confrontation → spotting deletion → intervention yields DC closure in drafting statement, with legible cost ("reduce our shine") in final image. Single scene anchors orientation early ("climb to the echoing observatory"); no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory micro-setting (dome's "slow eyelid," catwalk keyboard) constrains choices, charging technician intervention; sensory hierarchy (humming floor, wind hisses) filters through heiress's observational bias. Recurring echoes mirror truth-seeking, evolving to "thank you" payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt false article via truth) tightens causally: graphs contradict → deletion attempt forces agency in proof-by-contradiction intervention; cost unmistakable in "anger burns clean" and shine loss charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth-over-flattery emerges via particulars (staged images, graphs "confess"); final dawn call reconfigures orbits/regret without moralizing, reweighting premise with contrition cost. Subtext in solemn echoes invites ambiguity on institutional shine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (newsprint-sky metaphors) modulates rhythm under pressure, stable without slippage; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Kline's blame-shifts). Diction reflects heiress's lexicon precisely.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-embedded action; figurative saturation purposeful/consistent but dense in climax ("graphs look back like children") slightly risks coherence (-0.4). Zero loops; strong verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Proof-by-contradiction fused with newsprint-observatory frame transforms science fraud trope organically; voice's sky-ink synthesis inevitable in hindsight, bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
