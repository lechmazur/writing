<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Collective "we" motivation rooted in survival-trust earns communal endurance with felt cost in swapped shifts; Ana's steady grip embodies particularity without contradiction. Minor dilution from group POV limits individuated impulses acting simultaneously, but micro-choices under pressure (e.g., "nobody refused") compel higher stakes organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chalk plans to relays to dusk ascent accumulate density toward CR closure in Vine's spiral ("Reexamine what you call haunting"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of persistent vigilance over rest. Orientation anchored early (orchards/arches); one tightening at climb suffices, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain relay choreography and charge final threads stitching vapor; bell as micro-setting evolves tactile use across beats. Sensory hierarchy (dew/chalk, wind/chime) filters through communal urgency, mirroring internal brambled hope without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drought stake signaled early tightens via dusk agency (Ana tilts bell, collectives climb), reweighting options under accumulative lens with visible cost in prior "work survived" and swapped grudges. Pressure coheres communally without reversal need; cost legible in "dust" to "dew" payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of braided trust/haunting emerges implicitly from chalk relays and final spiral, offering non-literal CR answer ("voices braid like vines") that reweights isolation-premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like Ana's saved life avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in ghost's no-sleep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in first-plural collective (interior access coherent), perceptual signature biased to orchard textures ("shadows braided," "brambled hope"); rhythm modulates from dawn whisper to hush climax. No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm (e.g., short chime sentences amid lyric swells); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative pattern (vines/arches) coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in nebula description contained, serves closure image without opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi ritual (nebula/bell/arches) transforms communal tropes via ghost-chalk logic; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from Vine's persistent constraint. Bold planet premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
