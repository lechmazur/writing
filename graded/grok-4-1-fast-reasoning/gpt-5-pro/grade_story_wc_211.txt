<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when recognizing own handwriting in grooves ("my cadence haunts them"), compelling earned choice to witness rather than seal, with embodied cost in self-implication; interiority particular via guild training vs. prophecy's pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from unspooling shaving to Hittite whisper, delivering Charged Poise closure ("write the prophecy beside it") with legible cost in forgoing binding; orientation anchors immediately in first lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard atop skyscraper constrains climax via bark for etching prophecy ("press the shaving to the bark"); sensory details (apple roots hum, fog like down comforter) filter through POV priorities, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to archive patterns tightens via self-implicating prophecy ("my name will be the knife"), forcing agency in refusal to seal; cost unmistakable in "lose the echo that taught us mercy" vs. exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of legible bindings over rigid oaths emerges organically from shaving's remainder arithmetic to final bark inscription, reweighting premise without statement; resonant counter-reading in tree's "you are the knife, and also the sheath."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("wind moves like courtroom hands") and rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable single POV with purposeful compression taught early via orchard textures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring emotional cadence; figurative consistency ("memory has teeth like moths") pattern-taught without muddle, though minor fig saturation in prophecy reveal slightly dulls peak sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of oath-fruit harvesting and phonograph ghosts transforms tropes into inevitable prophecy via grooves' "arithmetic... subtracting leaves the shape"; risky lyric risks heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
