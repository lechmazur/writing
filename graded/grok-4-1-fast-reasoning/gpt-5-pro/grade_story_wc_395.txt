<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's internal conflict peaks in "the lie is heavier now, a magnet to filings of consequence, and I almost clock out," earning the final renunciation through embodied contradiction and escalating motive without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as recurring numbers densify into topologies guiding vault descent, culminating in Charged Poise closure—"let deletion be a home rather than a punishment"—with legible conceptual cost in the reweighted absence and bus ad flash.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sargasso cold room and anaerobic layers constrain descent via rack mapping; patch overlay on "missing drives" charges final image, with sensory details like "fabric smells like dry rain" filtered through metadata-attuned POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover deletions vs. rules) tightens accumulatively through voice notes naming liars, forcing agency in "smallest impossible thing" with felt cost of persistent numbers haunting commute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of systemic disappearance emerges organically from quarantined deletions and numbers' recurrence, answered non-literally in "Lia is not recovered, but she is not entirely missing," reweighting forgetting with merciful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "ghosts hum in metadata" sustains rhythmic control, modulating from hush to whispering room under lie's pressure without drift or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (e.g., "looping orbit stitched like a noose"); no loops or artifacts dull closure image of bus ad "1103," passing read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive stewardship and metadata ghosts transforms cold case trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with numbers' inevitability feeling earned in hindsight.</comment>
