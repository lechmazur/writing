<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via sculptor's perceptual bias toward "wrecked ribs and fluted limbs"; micro-choices like hammering pebbles reveal hierarchy of values under storm pressure, earning final endurance with felt bodily cost. Contradictory trust in sea vs. failed GPS acts simultaneously in scene. Final renunciation of tech-reliant navigation compelled by prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via storm hum/reverie and holds; orientation anchored in first paragraph (road, GPS fail, driftwood sculptor). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in dawn gull-path image and new map handling "human currents," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of perpetual listening over tools. One tightening via slide-projection deepening to shelter-build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway as micro-setting constrains choices (wave offerings supply materials, projects slide); sensory hierarchy (ozone, foam curls, turbine growl) reflects sculptor's priorities. Basalt "black rib cage" mirrors internal states through action, evolving causally with lightning flare; charges final gate-image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate storm/loss via building/listening) signaled early post-GPS fail; Accumulative lens escalation via density increase in slide-ghosts to reverie, narrowing to stance crystallization in new alliances. Protagonist agency in gathering/hammering forecloses tech-path with embodied cost (curling inside shelter amid rain). One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of timewoven alliances/scaffolding emerges organically from driftwood-build and slide-ghosts, culminating in non-literal resonant answer: slide blessing bolts as memory-made-tangible. Complexity embraced via counter-reading of storms as training; final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sculptor's syntax/rhythm ("curls of foam and the gulls that argue over maps"); single POV stable, modulating with pressure (degraded thought in reverie). Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "waves comb through the keyhole" advances setting/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion matches scene (short under lightning). Minor figurative density in build-beat borders overwriting but pattern-taught in lyric mode without muddle or loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of driftwood sculptor + magic slide-ghosts transforms lost-GPS trope into fresh timewoven navigation; bold lyric risk in turbine/sea pantomime heightens stakes coherently. Final reimagining invitation feels inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
