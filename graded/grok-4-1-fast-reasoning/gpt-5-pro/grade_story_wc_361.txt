<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between wonder and overextension's hunger act in the climax ("sweet and dangerous"), earning the release choice with embodied cost (thinning dawn felt via mentor's knife metaphor); jittery need proves character-specific flaw driving micro-choices throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from routine walk to climax release; closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page with legible cost ("give back sharpness to the coming light") in pendant's fading tone, reconfiguring practice without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridgeway and pendant as micro-settings constrain choices (hums guide listening, narrows to blade forces delivery); thyme/bread sand charges final image, sensory selection POV-biased and purposeful without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax wonder sans dependence) signaled early tightens via one decisive deepening ("moment begins to stretch, sweet and dangerous"), forcing agency in release; cost unmistakably legible in sensed hunger thinning dawn, charging closure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "notice, invite, release" emerges organically from particulars, final image of errands-as-seeds offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting absence-to-forgiveness arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tremors as intentions, germinate unnamed) and rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in release beat); stable single POV with lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line advances texture/stakes), varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor metaphor density in walk ("taffy") purposeful without muddle, no loops obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic courier with vibration physics transforms absence trope via sympathetic humming; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via germinate/release cadence.</comment>
