<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nested selves in mural reveal interior progression from apprentice to future self, earning change through embodied curiosity vs. certainty tension; micro-choices like stylus nudges show contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with echo density building to CR closure in "consenting to keep waking while the next ring breaks the next surface," legible cost in perpetual change; orientation anchored early in garden/restorer setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's humming hedges and ripple fountains constrain choices via sound mechanics, charging final hedge-echo path; body/tools like nickel/stylus integrate tactilely, POV-filtered through restorer's ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sonic restoration escalates via nested echoes deepening knowledge, agency in pings/redirections foreclosing forceful certainty; cost felt in willingness to change, one tightening sufficient under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening as perpetual awakening emerges implicitly from particulars like "tiny cranes unfolding," final image reweights premise with non-literal resonance of ongoing waking without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-color synesthesia (e.g., "pigments tuned to answer questions using echo") modulates rhythmically; stable first-person with purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, metaphors consistent in reflection motif without muddle; minor figurative prevalence in peaks serves accumulative pattern payoff, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sonic-mural premise synthesizes fresh angle on restoration via echoes/awakenings, bold lyric risks heighten stakes; "hobo nickel" as lens transforms patience trope organically.</comment>
