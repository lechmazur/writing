<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation as capsize survivor compels endurance through ferry trauma embodied in "blue-lipped" survival and tuning fork inheritance; Sura's partnership forces micro-choices like tracing frost lines. Internal conflict subtle in fearing heart as "bobbing buoy" yet building communal music. Earned stasis in final vow renewal without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from personal vow to performances and bell rectification, tightening via pattern of frost notations; orientation anchored early in conservatory post-noise world. Closure as CR in "it moved the same river that had once tried to turn me into drift," reweighting silence with endurance cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory micro-setting constrains choices via frost staves and heat-mapped panes mirroring emotions; recurring glass and frost evolve causally with actions like sleeve-sealing notation. Final image charges environment as "glass house of fragile endurance," biasing perception to thermal/silent wonders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to translate silence into music signaled early, escalates accumulatively through visitor thermals to bell circuit under lens, narrowing to communal endurance. Agency in coding intervals and lacing forks forecloses solo survival with cost in crowd's "printed ovation." One decisive deepening via delegates' request suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of music as verb rectifying heartbeats emerges organically from heat maps and frost scores, not stated; subtext in fisherman's kelp implying shared survival. Final CR reweights premise—"we are finally doing it right"—resonating without moral, charging prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice stable with perceptual signature tying silence to frost vibrations and thermal colors; syntax modulates lyrically for emotional cadence. No head-hopping despite Sura's signing; elisions like noise-loss taught early and paid in music-making.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "sunlight braided... patient breath" purposeful in lyric mode, varying rhythm for propulsion; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor overwriting in peak descriptive runs contained, clarity intact at "frost became score."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-noise world with thermal emotion-mapping and silent forks transforms silence trope into indispensable ingenuity; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscurity. Final reconfiguration inevitable from ferry vow through conservatory endurance.</comment>
