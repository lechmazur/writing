<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's contradictory impulses—swearing fortunes only nudge yet orchestrating via microdots—act in scene, earning the final folding of the booklet with relational cost as the group exhales the "tight knot." Secondary characters arrive as pressure points, distinct in gestures (ferryman sheepish, constable's palms). Flaw balance: competence in spycraft tempered by island's open-secret limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early fortune-seeding density blooms into glowing messages via arrivals, landing Charged Poise closure ("the room exhaled... untying a tight knot") with conceptual cost of exposure reconfiguring pretense. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (basalt steps, lighthouse beam). Single scene fits defaults; no shards or disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens constrains pivotal choice (taping fortunes for dots to "swell into a message"), charging final beam swing; sensory hierarchy (oilskin "gulls and rope and citrus memory," sea "practice the new melody") mirrors internal shift. Rocky island buoys as patient eyes evolve with hush, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchestrating open-secret revelation) signaled early via seeded fortunes; textural escalation peaks in dots blooming "sentences about nights when boats docked without papers," forcing stance crystallization with exhaled cost. Agency in taping drives turn; moral calculus (refuge vs. contraband) sharpens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges via particulars (fortunes as ripples, dots as music), final image ("transpose life into a new key together") resonantly reweights without moralizing. Subtext in silences (constable's empty palms) and Elias's "some secrets die by daylight" invites ambiguity on pretense's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable on Mei, perceptual signature in noticing "dots... like mistakes" biased toward orchestration; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Your light again... Mine too"). Rhythmic prose modulates with arrivals, no head-hopping despite cast.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density ("taped thin fortunes... punctures would swell") propels without loops; metaphors cohere (light as "metronome... glass cathedral"), varying rhythm peaks in "dots bloomed, gathering into sentences." Minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught, no scaffold touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of microdots, fortunes, lighthouse beam transforms spy trope into communal transposition; "directing flow rather than force" inflects turns organically from booklet. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in beam's final swing.</comment>
