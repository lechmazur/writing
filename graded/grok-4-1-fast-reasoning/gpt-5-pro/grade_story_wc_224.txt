<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (memories "chew through sleep"); micro-choices under pressure reveal values (offering "last year's key"); earned change from seeking enclosure to "permissions" at stone's speech, with contradictory fear acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from gate to rotunda; CR closure in "home as practice" reweights premise with cost ("paid it for years without receipt"); orientation anchored by ~50 words (mountain climb, seer); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory weave (glue/ash/rain smells, "corridors braid"); setting constrains (staircases loop choices, rotunda floor "unreadable skin"); recurring mountain "reconsiders silhouette" and "reshapes room" charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (home's shape) signaled early, tightens via stone-reading deepening under accumulative lens; agency in breath-seed forecloses hiding path; cost legible in "meaning bites" and "difference between shelter and hiding."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (stone's "geometry of pulse" to home unfolding); final image ("seed every threshold") non-literally answers without moral; reweights "buried talents" as permissions with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rooms as climates"); stable first-person with rhythmic modulation (short sentences at peak: "The stone warms; the feather listens"); seer dialogue subtextual ("maps are only apologies"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows from long metaphorical to punchy finals); no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors cohere (feather "greets like rain remembering drought") without muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis (bookstore-mountain, feather-texture reading) transforms quest trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from "substitutes reality" pattern to palm-room.</comment>
