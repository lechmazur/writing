<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's scheming pacifism drives micro-choices like wrist-touch and stone placement, earning Mara's change through embodied conflict; minor diagnostic slips in "cellular memory" but do not touch closure embodiment in final pulse-listen beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival skepticism to memory-softening, landing Charged Poise RR in "war stood and turned home" with conceptual cost of reshaped resentment; orientation anchored early, one tightening via name-speaking suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary and broken pin constrain choices (hush numbs sabre, pin anchors demo) and charge final image (box to sternum reintroduces kiss); sensory hush/dust braids mirror internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (convince release) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via doubt-touch-names to agency-renunciation with cost in dulled blade-memory; one deepening forecloses war path legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resentment-release emerges organically via pin/memory/stones, final non-literal image ("resentment stepped back, almost relieved") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (scheming lyricism) with biased noticing (cells over ears); dialogue subtextual/natural ("preach peace with a toy"), distinct voices, rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyric metaphors ("plate on wet fingers") taught early pay off in dust-map; minor density overload in mid-beats but clarity holds to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory/music box/pacifist siege-ending transforms war tropes; risk in abstract grace-to-concrete via body charges closure inevitably.</comment>
