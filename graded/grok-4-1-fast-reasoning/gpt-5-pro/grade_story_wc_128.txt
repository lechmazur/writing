<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrator's shrewd broker traits root motivation in cargo instincts twitching like stowage stories; interiority concrete in embodied "cautious exuberance, the tremor of good news." Contradictory caution balances exuberance in testing ledger moment, earning closure endurance with persistence despite sea's threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds from envelope spark to ledger testing; orientation anchored early in pier walk and library. Closure as CR in "cargo and music share one truth" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of ungloved hands' grace, legible in final wharf image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library "windows...like sails" and "tables smell faintly of lemon and salt" filter through broker's tide-sensing bias; recurring cranes/stars constrain final perception. Environment charges closure image of "cranes like stars...patiently lifting," mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uplifting silent contributors signaled in "private mission"; accumulative deepening via crew testing narrows to "restraint and persistence" over fanfare. Cost legible in "sea can take it back," charging final doubt endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of compassion cycles emerges from locket's spiral connections without statement; subtext in whispers carrying farther than shouts. Final image non-literally answers ledger's fragility with "each thank you encouraging another like tide and moon."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature in broker idioms like "ledger closed but my senses open"; rhythmic modulation fits reflective pressure. No head-hopping; elisions pattern-taught in sea metaphors pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern ("lifting," tides); varied rhythm propels without loops. Minor metaphor density in opening ("gulls edit the sky") coherent and voice-motivated, not obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh ledger-of-kindnesses premise synthesizes broker logistics with library archive organically; transforms kindness trope via cargo/music parallels. Risky lyric reflection heightens stakes of persistence, inevitable in hindsight via locket reprise.</comment>
