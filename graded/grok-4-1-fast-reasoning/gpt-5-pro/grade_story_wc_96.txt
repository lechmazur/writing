<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and micro-choices reveal the poet's contradictory impulses—whispering meter to calm ribs under patrol pressure—earning the endurance of rebuilding with Mara; molting trait constrains via shifting personas that Mara trusts, shown not just told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from duo's arrival to community joining and child's entry as Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "neon threats" and patrol hush foreclosing safety, reconfiguring trespass into caretaking without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted library and ivy/rebar constrain choices (prying bars, braiding against collapse) and charge final image of bricks singing; sensory hierarchy (twine measured, wind tests) reflects poet's priorities, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forging beauty escalates via patrol deepening (coherent pressure forces continued hammering) and community arrival narrowing isolation; agency in endurance shows cost in risked arrest, but lacks one agency-driven reversal beyond persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blooming resistance emerges organically from seeds tucked in bricks to vines scribing cursive, resonant final image repricing anarchy into plural-breathing library without moralizing; subtext in unsigned poem lingers with ambiguity of threats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("skull molts," "shelves remember") modulates rhythm under stress (short whispers vs. unspooling twine); stable first-person with purposeful compression pays off in charged closure image, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "green cursive up the scars" propel via varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loop in repeated "friendship sparked sorting books" and motif churn (coffee tin thrice) dulls select beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prison-honed friendship rebuilding condemned library as blooming resistance transforms squatter trope via molting poet and secret tin; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes inevitably to dawn naming.</comment>
