<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Philosophical seed collector's motivation to preserve knots drives concrete micro-choices like using fulgurite and guiding the fisherman's hands, with contradictory patience under dock-demolition pressure earning the teaching renunciation; fisherman's amusement-to-respect shift applies relational crucible without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation (dock, snow, fog by para 1) and density-building knot decodings tightening to Charged Poise closure in sprig-planting and knot-teaching, reconfiguring solitary preservation to shared with legible cost of dock's threat; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dock, rope, and fulgurite constrain choices (coaxing without breaking fibers) and charge final image (fulgurite across coils as "listening bone"); sensory hierarchy (whistle through fulgurite, boots squeaking) filters via POV's patient attunement, evolving with snow/fog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve knots before demolition) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via three messages and collaborative decoding narrowing to shared-teaching agency; fisherman's council news forces trade-off patience vs. haste, with cost felt in "quick, yet infinitely patient."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of encoded knowledge as living inheritance emerges organically from knot decodings and sprig-planting, reweighting patience as fidelity in final "living sentence"; subtext in fisherman's grandmother hum layers ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (ropes as "sleeping serpent," knots as "grammar") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm with pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I have no time"), distinguishing fisherman's steam-breath idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid, consistent metaphors (fulgurite as "brittle flute," rope lighter at end) propelling via varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts, every line integrates action/atmosphere, climaxing in tar-sliver levering without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh premise of knot-language decoded via lightning-glass transforms folklore trope into tactile preservation stakes; risk of poetic compression pays off in inevitable hindsight of sprig as "final note," heightening closure without gimmickry.</comment>
