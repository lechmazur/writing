<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—wanting safety yet rejecting full silence—act simultaneously in the bolt-threading choice, earning the renunciation with embodied nerve pain as cost; bellhop applies pressure via gestures without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to Charged Poise closure in the reversed bolt ("a hinge upon which to open") and decision to speak, with legible cost in complicity weighed on-page; orientation anchored early in fortress arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Staircase discoloration and bolt constrain path and choice, charging final image; body-as-micro-setting (nerve sparks "like snowfall on bare skin") mirrors hush, with sensory selection urgent and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety's cost) signaled in opening whisper, tightens texturally via engine reveal to hinge reversal, driven by agency with unmistakable cost in foreclosed full-silence path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unpardonable silence theme emerges implicitly through gestures and bolt, reweighted non-literally in final "choir breathing in" image without moralizing; resonant answer to safety-testimony tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature biases toward tactile hush and nerve "lightning," with rhythmic modulation under pressure; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but exact repeats ("via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase"; "during nerve regeneration" x3) create minor loop artifacts dulling propulsion in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Piano bench bolt from concert panic synthesizes survivor trauma with fortress hush into inevitable hinge refusal; bold lyric risks transform silence trope without gimmickry.</comment>
