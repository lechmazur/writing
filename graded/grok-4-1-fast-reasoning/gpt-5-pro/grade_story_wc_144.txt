<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices in patching drone and tuning console reveal motivation rooted in sensory expertise; Jaro's narration adds relational pressure. Minimal internal contradiction limits to very strong; competence overshadows flaw-driven struggle, but endurance earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from drone damage to recovery; on-page RR (Charged Poise) in "The day opened...because one artisan listened" reconfigures options with timing cost legible in "anchor would not wait forever". Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bowls and mist as micro-setting constrain mapping choices via refraction, charge final image of harmonized rails/anchor. Sensory hierarchy (echo, oil, pulse) reflects Mara's blind priorities; purposeful selection integrates with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover crate pre-launch) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via repair/decoding to recovery; agency in tonal adjustments narrows options. Cost in time pressure visible ("chain and bell...would not wait"); one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of decoding noise into direction emerges organically from sensory particulars; final image ("direction, decoded into motion") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting blindness without moral. Subtext in sound-as-braille lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sensory-biased perceptual signature (textures/echoes); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Left two frequencies narrower"); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; purposeful figurative pattern (e.g., "iron prayers") avoids muddle in peak repair beat. Minor density in opening risks overwrite but supports accumulative lens without loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind sensory tech-artisanry in misted industrial harbor transforms tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
