<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in the entanglement beat ("panic snarled... ascend now" vs. "stopped kicking, breathed"); final endurance earned via prior promise to mother. Micro-choices reveal values under pressure. Hairline slip: slight diagnostic self-awareness in "I understood I could send more than numbers" borders therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from approach to vial opening, culminating in Charged Poise RR where vial-to-signal transforms distress into shared hush with oxygen/heat cost ("turn down my oxygen... tax in fogged breath"). Orientation anchored early ("underwater temple"). One tightening at unsnarl suffices; cost legible in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constraints choices (netting "gilded with shells" catches transmitter, forcing override; anemones guard vial) and charges closure (temple "holds some of my heat"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (fish as "patient saints," hush "strokes... helmet"). Micro-setting (coralized plinth, silver pockets) evolves causally, mirrors internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve vial) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to sacrificial sharing; entanglement reversal narrows options, agency in overriding instinct forecloses ascent. Escalation via gauges/time forces trade-off, cost unmistakable ("gauges shouted... dwindling time," oxygen rationed). Coheres under Textural lens with cadence shift reweighting stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral preservation emerges organically from vial/mother/hush, reweighted in closure image ("radios might soften... grief loosened") without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures (vial "touches ribs"); complexity lingers in ambiguous martyrdom ("not choosing martyrdom... stay very still"). Final image answers central question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (ocean "breathes me in," hush "pressure that touches memories") biased to diver's synesthetic view; rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short sentences in panic: "I tried to kick free, and panic snarled"). Stable first-person intimacy; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm (e.g., entanglement beat accelerates via fragments); metaphors coherent and voice-motivated ("hawk tightening its claws"). Minor deduction for figurative density bordering overwrite in climax ("liquid light... perfume translated to frequency, a library read aloud") without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic temple-dive with signal-as-memory-perfume; tropes (lost artifact quest) transformed via textural hush-sharing. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes (ephemeral vial constrains all); inevitable in hindsight from mother's jars to final swim. Non-obvious angle on grief via frequency-carried "winter sun on stone steps."</comment>
