<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrator's patience under withholding reveals contradictory impulses toward certainty and surrender; researcher's self-experiment ties traits to visible cost in his boyish disappearance. Minor slip: narrator's reception lacks sharper internal friction before trance deepens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density builds to CR closure—researcher's vanishing reweights presence via rings, with conceptual cost legible in "to continue would erase him." Orientation anchored early in sycamore hush/platform; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto/pond/ripples constrain observation choice and charge final image, evolving causally from pebble drop; iron sand's trembling letters mirror trance without overt symbolism. Sensory filter (starlight, hum) selective via meditative POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn via delayed revelation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through trance/pattern-watching to researcher's disappearance, narrowing to realization with erasure cost. Agency in sustained attention forecloses impatience path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vanishing-to-appear emerges from ripple particulars and iron script, reweighting premise in final rings without moralizing; resonant CR answers "how vanishing might let a thing appear true" obliquely via his absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meditative perceptual signature (breath as door, stars in ribs) consistent; dialogue sparse, subtextual (withholding as scaffold). Minor: occasional elevated diction borders POV lexicon in peak trance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative layering ("rings laced, overlapped") risks overwrite in middle beats without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling propulsion before closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Backward-aging via self-erasure transforms trope through ripple-logic synthesis; risk in trance-time disappearance feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
