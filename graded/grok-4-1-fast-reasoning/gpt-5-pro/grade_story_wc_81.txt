<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rage vs logic in tracing judge's ledger) act in scene, earning final restraint; micro-choices like steady palms inking the stamp reveal values with cost. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding epiphanies. Family blind spot compounds struggle authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stamp test to kelp pattern shift to proof, with CR closure in "pages queued by a logical page indexer and an honest stamp" reweighting truth's premise with conceptual cost to forgers. Orientation anchors early (library, blackout). No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Algae veins and dome brine constrain choices (headlamp off, listening grace) and charge final image of silt-settled stillness. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (salt-furred spines, books breathe). Micro-setting (stamp on rag) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (honest origins vs forgery) signaled early, tightens texturally via crescent discovery narrowing options; agency in hypothesis tree forecloses revenge with legible cost in "revenge writes crooked." Escalation coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs power emerges from kelp eye shift and gnawed crescent, resonating in arrow to "where the eye frond first changed" without moralizing. Final image reweights premise organically. Ambiguity lingers in quiet reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brine tick... slow metronome," "silt settled like thinking") biases toward logical lyricism; rhythmic control modulates with intensity, stable first-person distance. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied openings, no loops); metaphors cohere (algae stars, books resist and breathe) without muddle in peak (stamp test). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-flood archival detective work via stamp forensics transforms tropes; bold lyric sci-fi voice risks poetic compression heightening stakes, inevitable in hindsight at proof's arrow.</comment>
