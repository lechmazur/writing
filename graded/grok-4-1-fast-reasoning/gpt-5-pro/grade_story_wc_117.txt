<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Felix's micro-choices from tapping to singing "mama" reveal internal conflict and earn change through embodied responses; therapist's adaptive traits constrain forcing voice, shown in patient invitations. Minor therapy-speak like "nurture lifelong wonder" borders diagnostic but anchors in actions without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density via eclipse progression to Charged Poise closure in totality's "clean" silence and Felix's vowel sounds; cost legible in "not a cure, but a beginning large enough for wonder to grow," foreclosing quick fixes with patience's price. Orientation anchors early; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bowl and curl as micro-settings constrain ceremony choices and charge final hand-back image; juniper roots and sage dust filter through therapist's perceptual bias, evolving with shadow to mirror internal hush. Sensory hierarchy narrows to crickets and corona under eclipse urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gentle voice recovery tightens accumulatively via call-response escalation to singing under eclipse pressure; agency in therapist's invitations forces Felix's heel-tap trade-off, with felt cost of endured silence paid in totality's hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of voices "change addresses" emerges organically from curl-to-bowl linkage and sage-toned exhale; final hike with "quiet like a seed" reweights attention-as-magic without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in wonder's slow growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in music metaphors ("long held note," "footsteps of tone") biases noticing rhythms; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual ("voices never leave"), with stable close-third POV modulating rhythm to eclipse cadence. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "shadows sharpened like careful pencil lines along stone"; minor overwriting in eclipse metaphors (lacework, shawl) slightly muddles peak beat clarity, but rhythm varies purposefully without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse ceremony with singing bowl and hair curl transforms therapy trope via site-specific details; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, with curl-tap-to-corona payoff feeling inevitable and irreplaceable.</comment>
