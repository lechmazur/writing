<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's dual allegiance drives contradictory impulses shown in concrete micro-choices like pressing the chip into Yano's and Miri's palms, earning the pivot to a braid; embodied emotions via scents like citrus rind over rust. Minor abstraction in reflective summaries slightly dilutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via graffiti codes to Charged Poise closure ("dual allegiance no longer a split but a braid"); orientation anchored early in raft city routes; cost legible in "not triumphant, but not conquered" pivot that forecloses easy spectacle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raft city murals and rope bridges constrain choices (chip in shrimp mouth blooms path); sensory hierarchy via tide-shadow, diesel-jasmine charges final image; recurring chip as micro-setting reweights premise at tongue tuck.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reorganize routes against privatization) signaled early, tightens via heron code forcing guild-council trade-off; agency in midnight mural and dawn agreement with felt cost ("not happily"); one decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of worlds colliding emerges organically from graffiti pivots and braided allegiance; final image ("wind from upriver brought diesel and jasmine") offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting gentrification premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with perceptual signature (chaos as "swirl... slot it into a path that flowed like song") stable and biased; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("It is not a finale... pivot"); rhythm modulates with pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives (fireworks "folded into cinders") taught early, no loops or scaffolds; minor overwrite in metaphors slightly blurs one peak beat (shrimps/gears), but propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-code resistance in raft carnival against gentrification; risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes, with chip's silt wisdom inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
