<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in the restorer's secret fear of seeing their own face in broken masks, embodied through patient untying under pressure. Contradictory impulses emerge in micro-choices like handing a knot to the trembling daughter, revealing vulnerability. Final grounding earns a credible endurance with felt relational cost in the sack exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as knot-untying builds density toward Resonant Reconfiguration: coffer's wet sigh and reburial reweight unrest with conceptual cost in "lucid unrest remains." Orientation anchors early in prism sanctuary. No lens ambiguity; persistent net constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's glass ribs and refracting starlight constrain choices, scattering "ribbon of starfire" to stir sand during climax. Net as recurring micro-setting cools threads on touch, mirroring internal states tactilely. Final hum evolves environment causally, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to ground spirit signaled early; density escalates via unraveling, daughter joining for mutual tremor that narrows isolation. Agency in shared untying forces trade-off, with visible cost in secrets shared and sack taken. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights frantic light to grounded laugh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mending unrest emerges from particulars like cooling threads and rising coffer, culminating in non-literal final image: "lucid unrest remains... reminding me there is more to unmoor." Reweights binding/unmooring without moralizing. Subtext in daughter's fear and restorer's reflection invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tidal, prismatic diction ("nets you cannot see until your hands are already snagged") biases toward hushed geometry. Voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, compressing in climax untying. Stable first-person; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("he left angry").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, varying lengths building to "wet sigh" climax. High density: lines layer image/action like "threads cool as if remembering winter." Minor paraphrase loops in silence/hush motifs (−0.4), but purposeful pattern; no closure muddle or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration as spirit-grounding ritual via net-untying transforms tropes organically. Bold lyric voice risks poetic density but heightens stakes coherently. Final "stars lean closer... turns a page we have earned" feels inevitable, non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
