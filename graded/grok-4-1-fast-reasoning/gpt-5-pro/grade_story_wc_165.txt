<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Performer's analytical traits drive micro-choices like chalk grid and bishop pivot, earning the final gifting with relational cost as she absorbs into night. Contradictory impulses surface in weighing "diagonal promises against straight lines," embodied in precise setups versus sea's wildness. Woman's secondary pressure forces tactical shifts in the game.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from props to grid game to crowd compliance, culminating in Charged Poise closure as "tide advanced a rank, remaking the board" with conceptual cost of ephemerality. Orientation anchored early in tidal arcade; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal stones constrain choices (chalk grid drunk by tide) and charge final image of dissolving blueprint. Sensory hierarchy (salt/wind beats, tide metronome) reflects performer's priorities; weather evolves causally, mirroring internal measured wildness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenade monotony via creativity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through woman's game entry and crowd drafting lanes, narrowing to applause square with felt cost in grid's erasure. Protagonist agency in setups forces stance crystallization; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of orchestrated serendipity emerges via grid play and "Discovery is a design," resonant in final tide remaking without moralizing; diagonals motif reweights straight monotony with ambiguity. Closing image non-literally answers efficiency vs. wildness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in analytical metaphors ("sea had a metronome," "chalk to act as silent grammar") biases noticing; stable third-limited POV with clean distance. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Do you play"), advances via microcurrents.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "gull shrieked, reset silence"); varied rhythm reads aloud fluidly, no loops/artifacts dulling closure image of "stones drank the chalk." Purposeful lyrical metaphors taught early, coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess/tide/serendipity in "orchestrated serendipity" frame transforms street performance trope; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via grid's erasure charging new beginnings.</comment>
