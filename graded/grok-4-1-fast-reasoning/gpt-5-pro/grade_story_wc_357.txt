<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses in shaking hands at climax; motivation rooted in mother's artifacts compels micro-choices like entering the veil. Final renunciation of arrow tip as weapon earns reconfiguration of resilience. Voice-specific flaws like blind spots in planet's stutter drive inevitable entry into scarred chamber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes and water flow builds to chamber discovery and tip-fitting DC/RR with on-page cost (cold hum through teeth). Single continuous scene anchored early by orchards and inversion; no orientation debt. Closure reconfigures options via healed braid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward river constrain flight path and tether choice, charging final seedling image. Sensory hierarchy (whirling silence, singing) reflects pilot's priorities, integrated into action. Root-sphere chamber as micro-setting pivotal to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of resilience) signaled early via changed singing; accumulative escalation via thinner hum to scarred glass deepens knowledge, narrowing to tip-fit agency. Cost legible in lurching river and trembling trees resolved on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as "hinge that knows how to slow falling" emerges via scarred arch and healed echoes, reweighting premise in final whisper without moralizing. Returning seed images shift meaning organically from stutter to sure fruit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (arrow tip as ember, echoes as ladders); rhythmic compression taught early via whirling silence, stable first-person under stress. Lyrical diction modulates with inversion's roar to hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "pears blossom back into fruit" advance closure without muddle. Varied rhythm, no loops; purposeful overwriting in sensory braid serves accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion, echo-growth, arrow-plug transforms tropes; risk in lyric sci-fi heightens stakes via scarred planet's voice. Inevitable hindsight from water-flow navigation to healed arches.</comment>
