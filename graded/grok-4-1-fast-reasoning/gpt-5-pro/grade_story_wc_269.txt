<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to trace disappearing paths roots in mother's eroding stories and coral absences, fueling persistent tapping and assembly; contradictory boredom yields revelation without unearned epiphany. Micro-choices like tapping dates reveal values under doubt, earning communal adaptation with felt personal cost. Internal voice particularizes grief as "count absences," tying flaws to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of taps, tides, and logs build density to nodal cycle CR, reweighting paths' disappearance with conceptual cost of memory vs. moon. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (station, post-ban, reefs). Margin "nodes?" line pivots causality without break, charging final beacons and lesson.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station and flats constrain crossings ("sanctioned hours," silted shoes), sensory hierarchy (beeps, gulls, basement rain smell) filters through POV's rhythmic noticing. Tide-silt evolution mirrors internal erosion, charging closure image of flexible beacons. Recurring posts/cairns ground choreography across elided months.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, accumulates via tapping escalation to nodal tightening that narrows options (wide tides sink Trace). Agency in assembly forecloses ignorance with cost of eroded stories visible in mother's note. Final meeting crystallizes stance under lens, with communal trade-off felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hearing erased paths emerges from taps/moon particulars, not statement; final "make room for it, assembling a future that can wait" non-literally reweights premise without moral. Subtext in ghosts/ghosts prefer cliffs invites ambiguity. Mother's script ties arc to question organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in first-person, perceptual signature rhythms patterns (taps as "metronome for weather and memory"); diction modulates from grief to "bright as stars." Village dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping. Compression taught early, legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short taps lines to long revelations), density high without loops; metaphors consistent (tides "rehearse old griefs," moon "writes"). No scaffolds, figurative purpose in "throat" of Trace charges image. Final line propels with image over tell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nodal tides post-ban synthesize climate/memory poetically, transforming trope via tapping revelation; risks lyric elision but heightens stakes inevitably. Fresh "drifting moored" frame anchors bold vision without gimmick.</comment>
