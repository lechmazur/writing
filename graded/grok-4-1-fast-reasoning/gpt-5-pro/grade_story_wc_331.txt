<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to find the stories' place drives consistent micro-choices like mapping via hyperbolic geometry and shelving air, rooted in predecessor traits; embodied emotions via scarf's warmth and chalky fingers reveal eccentricity under subtle pressure. Internal conflict emerges in search vs. duty tension, culminating in earned belonging with cost of ongoing service. Minor abstract phrasing in reflections slightly dilutes simultaneity of impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as textural density builds from tidying to hyperbolic path-forming and cul-de-sac discovery, delivering Charged Poise closure in "I belong to their weather and their measure" with conceptual cost of reversed ownership. Persistent constraints like scarf and geometry shape tactics without breaks. Orientation anchors immediately in library scene; no causality gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry shelves and tessellated tiles constrain navigation and charge discovery ("shelves stopped pretending... admitted they were lungs"), filtering through librarian's perceptual bias. Sensory details like cedar/lightning smells and page-clearing integrate purposefully into action. Final image of breathing library evolves causally, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding stories' place signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (atlas click to path to lungs) under Accumulative lens, narrowing from mapping to reoriented belonging. Agency in silent asking and air-shelving forecloses ownership path with duty's felt cost. Patrons' reactions add subtle pressure without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of analog life's curvature emerges organically from geometry-path and lung-shelves, reweighting search into reciprocal belonging without moralizing. Final image ("every book becomes precisely heavier") offers non-literal resonant answer to stories' address, embracing ambiguity of service cost. Subtext in scarf's evolution and patrons' quakes layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with perceptual signature ("equations can dream among the stanzas," "listen sideways") modulates rhythmically through intensity, stable first-person without slippage. Compression and elision taught early via hyperbolic mapping pay off legibly at closure. No dialogue; prose as character reflects eccentric mind under serene pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Shelves multiplied outward like coral" advances setting/action/theme); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor figurative density in peak discovery risks slight overwrite but pattern-taught and coherent, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion. Closure image clear and charged without artifacts.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry in a scientific poetry library transforms library trope into living topology, with scarf and analog memories enabling non-obvious belonging turn. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes via textural pressure, inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
