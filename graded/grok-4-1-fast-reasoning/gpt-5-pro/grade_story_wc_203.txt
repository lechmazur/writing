<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist's observant trait and ghost-seeing enable concrete micro-choices like dust analysis and barrel turning; interiority embodied in "truth is not heavier than silence." Earned change in unwinding forecloses hidden burdens with felt lightness; minimal contradiction fits competent endurance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify from dust to attic grift to unwinding; CR closure in open hatch and departing ghosts reconfigures facades with conceptual cost of exposed lies. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via second hatch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dust drifts and ceiling hatch constrain climbs and discoveries, charging attic mirrors; recurring cracks mirror internal states via POV tech filter ("shafts and cables"). Sensory hierarchy (fluorescent buzz dying) reflects urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover ceilings tightens accumulatively via hatch-barrel-unwinding progression driven by agency; cost legible in ghosts' release and "booth felt taller." Escalation reweights hidden agreements under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden ethics emerges implicitly via peeled paint, grift mirrors, and cracks; final "truth escape like steam" reconfigures premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice ("pigeons favor statues") biases perception toward broken systems; ghostly "dialogue" carries subtext naturally. Stable first-person focalization modulates rhythm with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("Dust sifted down, uncurling in filaments"); figurative pattern taught early without muddle or loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors during discovery beats slightly dulls peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech-ghost observer uncovering clockwork grift transforms circus tropes; ceiling "magician" and mainspring inevitability grow from particulars. Risky poetic texture heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
