<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via bonsai idioms and embodied regret (trunk braced like borrowed heart); contradictory patience vs. ache drives micro-choices to earned vocalization at pool, foreclosing silence with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to pool glow (blue uncurled), delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where compass rests inward, reweighting regret with undeniable emotional cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal pool and black stone constrain ritual choice and charge final blue settling; rain-rinsed wind filters through tutor POV, mirroring internal softening without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology color) tightens accumulatively to pool revelation, forcing endurance of unwave (her looking back); agency in minimal cuts pays visible cost, crystallizing stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Regret-as-tending emerges implicitly from prune/snip into curve, answered non-literally by blue migrating to voice/tree; final seeds-across-channel reweights premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pruning metaphors and rhythmic modulation (slow measure); stable single POV with lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to pool peak; purposeful blue metaphors cohere without muddle, though minor figurative density in "mood, not steam" borders overwrite but pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lace-woven instructions synthesize bonsai ritual with tidal blue forgiveness ingeniously; risk-taking lyric frame transforms apology trope, inevitable in hindsight via pattern payoff.</comment>
