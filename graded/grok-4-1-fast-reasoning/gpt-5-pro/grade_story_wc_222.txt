<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in narrator's fear as "doorway I longed to open" amid climb and tests; Kestrel's chivalry twists via betrayed secret, earning closure choice. Final queen break forecloses tidy vows with embodied cost. Traits shown indelibly through micro-choices like kissing secrets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of trades/secrets builds to CR at clock amendment, reweighting sky/vow with scroll's "forgive what the future makes." Orientation anchors in first lines; one tightening via false boards spill pays off cleanly. Persistent constraint of pieces/secrets shapes all tactics to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice spire constrains via traps/stairs, frost letters name intent; recurring sundial/chess charge final image where "stars waved like kelp." Sensory hierarchy (wind file, ticking teeth) biases via wonder-POV. Evolving details (numbers flow, tide pulses) mirror internal shift without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend vow) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via spill risk/false kings to Kestrel's thorn-secret, forcing queen break with legible cost. Agency in trades/restore narrows to conceptual repricing. Moral calculus between sameness/change charges peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of amending to unknown emerges via particulars (backward clock, flexible sky); final "adopted constellation that winked" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in secrets/kisses avoids morals; irony of "chivalry twisted" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable "we"-POV with collective perceptual signature (mystery-bowing, fear-embrace); rhythmic prose modulates from ascent tension to exhale sigh. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("still wanted to be?"). Diction/perception biased poetically yet character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels: metaphors like "snow moths" integrate action/atmosphere without muddle. Minor figurative density in chess spill (-0.3) but pattern-taught, closure vivid. No loops; rhythm varies, syntax breathes with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms fantasy tropes (thief/quest) via chess-secrets/time-amendment synthesis, inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric voice risks poeticism but heightens stakes coherently; fresh "spire as listening ear" inflects uniquely.</comment>
