<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via texture-filtered perception ("sifting noise for texture the way dockhands test ropes by touch"); contradictory impulses in solitary collecting vs. final sharing earned through causal buildup; motivation intensifies to compel teaching the woman, foreclosing isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from solitary fragments to shared layering; on-page Conceptual Repricing in final image of communal gathering/returning reconfigures nameless erasure with undeniable endurance cost ("returning what it gathered"); orientation anchored early ("towering labyrinth of shipping containers in a port city"); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting as micro-world constrains choices (mud archive at low tide, hulls thrum at high) and charges final image (moving "across the rhythm of tides"); sensory hierarchy POV-biased to textures/sounds; evolves causally with tides mirroring memory-weaving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming erased histories via fragments) signaled early, deepens via poison label pursuit to shared action under Accumulative lens; agency in following/tracking forces stance crystallization; visible cost in clerk's denial and persistent fog of proof charges ending poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories persisting in actions/textures emerges organically from particulars (overheard snippets, container dents as names); final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("gathering what the water returned, and returning what it gathered") reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (reality as "texture," "weave," "hum of backdoors"); rhythmic modulation builds intensity; stable first-person focalization with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("machines never listen").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "poison bottle curled like a secret tongue" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm/syntax propels without monotony; figurative density pattern-taught in lyric mode, coherent without muddle; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic ghost haunting port labyrinth, transforming erasure trope via textural memory-mapping; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes (solitude to alliance); inevitable hindsight from poison label seed to communal tide-work.</comment>
