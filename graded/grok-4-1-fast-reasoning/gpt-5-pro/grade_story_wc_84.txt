<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pilot's micro-choices under pressure, like calibrating drones to "treat starlight as ink" and directing pilgrim to stand, reveal hierarchy of values and earn the final realization. Pilgrim's backstory anchors present stillness with cost. Voice specificity distinguishes without dialogue overload.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to CR closure in "Belonging is not the note but the pause," reweighting chip's gaps with pilgrim's history as felt cost. Orientation anchored early at observatory. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "bronze cord that waits like a throat," pulled to open slit for drones; cooling stone and courtyard enable tactical spirals. Micro-setting (altar plate) charges chip's shiver and final warmth. Sensory filter (rotors "whisper like moths") POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) tightens accumulatively when pixels reveal chip "can only cast the spaces," forcing pilgrim's stance as anchor with endurance cost. Escalation via deepening reweights options toward "map made of rests."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from chip's absences to "pauses into distances," final image of "route like embroidery" offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars (star trails, matrix gaps) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (frequencies as "hums when a stranger says our names right") modulates rhythmically; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping, diction character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "sky's small patience" purposeful, not muddled. Minor figurative density in realization beat serves textural lens without obscuring. No loops; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drones stitching "silver scars" with ancient type chip transforms belonging into pauses, risk-taking in lyric tech-mysticism heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
