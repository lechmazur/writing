<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete, contradictory impulses—e.g., "calibrated treason... lets people sleep the night after freedom arrives"—earning the final renunciation of the personal hinge with embodied cost (pricked finger, accepted unfinished work).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup (tools/key) to closure's Charged Poise (personal hinge left closed, "some doors must keep their sleep") with legible conceptual cost in final image of wrapped tools and matched pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (aurora light reveals seams, stalactite condensate as ink) and charges closure ("marble sanctuary... had grown warmer than my fear"); micro-objects (thorn, key) as setting evolve tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (calibrated unlinking) signaled early, tightens via forging with blood deepening to personal hinge test; agency in micro-choices forecloses paths with on-page cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-tool emerges organically from particulars (unfinished folio, pricked dot); resonant CR in ending image ("aurora itself, forever writing") reweights mercy/treason without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (calligrapher's "truth of lines," hinges in grammar) with rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable POV, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor overwrite (−0.4) from figurative density in peak forging beat ("thorn skated... counterstrokes... only when the aurora flared") without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forger's craft as magical treason (key reveals "hinge hidden in grammar"); risk-taking in lyric world logic inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes.</comment>
