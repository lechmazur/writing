<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses shine in confession beat ("The water bruised bright, edits of light marking every clause I wanted to retract"), earning partial change with felt cost; minor abstraction in epiphany ("long repair") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure (child's kick as new map with conceptual cost of ongoing repair); orientation anchored early in lake arrival; one tightening via confession suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lake's bioluminescence constrains choices (halos recall fingerprints, ripples as maps guide navigation) and charges final image (ripples draw "new map"); sensory integration vivid and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early, deepens via confession trade-off narrowing to vial release with legible emotional cost ("ribs open a little and shut"); agency clear under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via unpolished truth emerges organically from confession and vial pour, resonant in final child-kick image reweighting "delicately robust" toward better choices without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "oars feathered rings of light, margins around sentences") modulates rhythm under pressure; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven; stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel momentum, purposeful repetition ("delicately robust," "newspaper lines") taught as pattern; minor figurative density in midlake dome slightly risks coherence but misses closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-traveler baseball navigating empathy-lake transforms tropes (e.g., confession vial) organically; risk-taking in poetic nav-by-ripples heightens stakes with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
