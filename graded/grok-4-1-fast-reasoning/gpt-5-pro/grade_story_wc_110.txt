<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in registrar's recognition ("I too had chosen quiet") drives pivotal self-confession by pointing to own name, earning change with embodied shake; Rell as foil applies pressure without headcount blur. Minor slip: epiphanic phrasing slightly abstracts at "freed by honesty" but ties to prior flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of doodles/lens builds to projection's RR (Charged Poise), reconfiguring mistrust with exposure cost legible in Rell's nod and pass drop; single scene tightens meaningfully via lens revelation without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forecourt constrains choices (rain pools in doodles, frame between columns) and charges closure (projector to street in wet air); sensory hierarchy (hissing tiles, lamp halos) mirrors internal hush purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust) signaled early, escalates via lens-deepening that forces self-recognition and projection setup, narrowing to mutual admission; cost visible in self-exposure but one micro-turn keeps under 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transparency emerges organically from lens/doodles to final street projection reweighting concealment; resonant image ("transparency was a posture... letting the water separate truth from wish") answers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (doodles as "little maps... loops the way sailors read weather") stable, rhythmic control modulates hush to "throat readying a vowel"; no dialogue, purposeful compression taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; purposeful figural pattern ("humming like bowls," "breathing glints") coherent but dense in opening risks slight overwrite, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lens-projector revealing doodles transforms museum trope into silent honesty ritual; risk-taking in lyric hush heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at Rell's nod.</comment>
