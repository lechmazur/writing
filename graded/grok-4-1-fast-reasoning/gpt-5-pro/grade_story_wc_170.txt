<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong painter motivation rooted in locket's tempo and possibilities theme, with micro-choices like kneeling to Lio earning crowd's change; Lio's gasp reveals hope under pressure. Minor slip: archetypal figures lack deeper contradictory impulses in scene, no visible flaws complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to Conceptual Repricing in final image of locket's echo creating "a second city beside the first, both beating toward possibility." Orientation anchored early in terrace/who/when; one tightening at Lio's vision-door with legible cost ("not a promise"). Closure cost undeniable in foreclosed straight reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism parapet and mirrors constrain painter's light-sketching method and charge Lio's dock vision. Sensory details (slick bricks, swallows, fruit-metal peal) selective via painter's perceptual bias, evolving with hush-to-bells. Final terrace echoes reconfigure internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lio's upriver loss vs. possibility) signaled early, tightens via painter's slate-locket beat forcing trade-off between promise and mere "maybes." Agency in hum/song/endurance of borrowed pulse; cost felt in "relief that did not drown," charging end under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of glances-as-doors emerges organically from visions and final "seam of brightness," reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in Lio's bright slate and city's humming habit, with ambiguity in unshared story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature in painter's biased noticing (tremors as echoes); rhythmic poetic compression taught early, modulates with hush intensity. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I am here... possibilities"); no head-hopping, elision pays off in CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "prism parapet" pattern avoiding loops; rhythm varies (short claps vs. long peals). Minor overwriting in opening figurative stack ("puddled skies... quiet chord") slightly dulls entry propulsion, but no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locket-engine and song-keyed mirrors transforms hope tropes via textural magic; risk in lyric compression heightens resonance without opacity. Final locket reprise inevitable from early setup.</comment>
