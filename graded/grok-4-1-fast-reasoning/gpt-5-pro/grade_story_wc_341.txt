<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through meteorological lens on grief (e.g., "data are grief and dust"); contradictory impulses of method vs. absence act in scene via categorizing and tying line, earning renunciation of rescue with felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught categorizations building density to Charged Poise closure ("the spool has remembered how to wind"); orientation anchored by ~50 words; cost legible in "not rescue" realization shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gondola, altimeter, burner constrain choices (e.g., "work the altimeter and the burner"); recurring pencil/telescope charge final wake-tracing; sensory hierarchy (grain of hush, fogged lens) mirrors POV priorities without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove spaces remember) signaled early, deepens texturally via cloud categories to line-tying agency; forecloses rescue path with "you are already geography" cost unmistakable in steadying balloon.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Absence-as-faithful-yarn theme emerges organically from cloud emotions/spooling; final loom image reweights premise non-literally, embracing grief complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (e.g., clouds as "wistful," "eloquent in their fatigue") modulates rhythm under vigil stress; stable first-person distance, purposeful compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm; minor fig-lang density in categorization lists dings slightly but pattern-taught; no loops obscure closure image ("papered in pencil dust and star grit").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation grief as emotional meteorology risks lyric compression heightening stakes; "cylinder" wake/loom reweighting inevitable from particulars, no template echoes.</comment>
