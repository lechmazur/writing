<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's seasonal muteness creates embodied contradiction, compelling signed micro-choices under pressure that earn her endurance at closure. Crowd reactions particularize via unrevealed griefs and tastes. Final palm on melting ice mirrors unflawed silence with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bells to ice glisten to water percussion, culminating in Charged Poise RR where aurora thickens and ice melts as legible conceptual cost. Single scene oriented early via bluff ascent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bluff's wind throat and mist-teased aurora constrain tuning placement and charge final thickening image. Sensory hierarchy (hush tasting rain, iceberg blinking) filters through Mara's tactile priorities. Spatial choreography clear in frame pivots and channels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve thinning wonder) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ice activation and water loss narrowing options. Felt cost in fragment sweating pricks fear, forces basin micro-choice. Protagonist agency in tuning persists to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Truth via music reconfigures hidden griefs into brave honesty without moralizing; final aurora as drinkable resonance reweights premise non-literally. Particulars (unnamed child, posture grief) yield emergent complexity over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature biases toward hues, tastes, touches; rhythmic modulation heightens from hush to symphonies. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in circling breaths at end. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/image (e.g., "light moved across the bells like fingers"). Varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffolds; figurative coherence in aurora/ice without muddle in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Post-words world with ice-memory and wonder-hue synthesizes fresh angle on truth/revelation. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via melting constraint without gimmick. Inevitable in hindsight: fragment's glisten/glisten vigil.</comment>
