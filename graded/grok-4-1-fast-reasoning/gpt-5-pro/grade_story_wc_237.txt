<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in faltering fingers recalling rooftop fall, embodied in scars warming as glowing harbors; micro-choices like sugar pebble offering reveal values hierarchy with cost. Earned change via shedding fear forecloses failure path. Elder Nam's taps apply precise pressure without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from first curve failure to hinge door swinging inward. Closure as Charged Poise reconfiguration (scars to harbors) lands on-page with silver ache cost in "held breath dried out at the edges." Orientation anchors immediately in platform and task.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Platform chains forgetting to clink and steam blurring to watercolor constrain held-breath ritual; crow quill and bowl as micro-settings charge choices. Sensory hierarchy (tea hearing heart) reflects scholar's priorities. Evolves causally with frost shedding to clear bronze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inscribe without choking lattice) tightens via ritual deepening after first failure, narrowing to hinge under breath clock. Agency in revisiting superstitions forces trade-off, cost legible in ache and shaking delight. Lens escalation via cadence to thunder rehearsal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of scars as shorelines/bridges emerges implicitly from rune failure to glowing harbors, reweighting premise without statement. Final image of runes as islands answers transformation question resonantly. Subtext in Elder's child/ancestor/hinge advice layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (ripples as runes waiting names) biases via scholar lens, stable first-person. Rhythm modulates from hush thickening to sound returning. Elder's sparse lines carry subtext, distinct idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with lines like "quill kiss the tea" advancing multiple layers; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in reflections (e.g., clouds as librarians) borders overwrite but pattern-taught lyric pays off at closure without muddle. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steam-rune premise synthesizes fantasy ritual with scar transformation organically; tropes like mentor (Nam's nods as mountains) refreshed via breath stakes. Risky lyric compression heightens closure image inevitability.</comment>
