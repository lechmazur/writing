<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in joyful sorrow layered with grief (hospital whispers into touch); advisor's charisma forces micro-choice to conduct with empty camera, earning final endurance as moon's instrument.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via signing pattern density to harbor response; CR closure in "empty photograph that still somehow contains the whole harbor breathing" reconfigures absence with conceptual cost of honored grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moonlight and tides constrain signing from jetty to jetty, charging final camera image; sensory hush ("rope fibers sighing") mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to disrupt via silence signaled in plan, tightens texturally as boats stop and captain signs "home"; agency in chalk mapping forces trade-off with police pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Resonant CR in "harbor that will remember for me" reweights silence-as-music without moral; subtext emerges from signing's "may your quiet be honored."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "tides hum their patient arithmetic" biases toward auditory silence; rhythmic modulation to sparse hush under regatta pressure sustains lyric coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "silence" recurrence avoids loops, propels to closure image; varied syntax ("fingers still tingling") passes read-aloud without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of signing silence disrupting regatta into grief's music; camera's empty eye as altar risks bold lyric reconfiguration, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
