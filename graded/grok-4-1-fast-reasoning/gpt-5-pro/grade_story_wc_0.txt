<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (measurement vs. mourning) act early in scene via "hands still tasting of salt and metal" and compel triage choices; endurance of gradual repair earned with cost of composting dramatic orchids. Final report's humility reveals values hierarchy without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dust-map reading to report drafting to morning image, with CR closure in "greenhouse begins to feel like a star made humble"; cost legible in "less heroic than a vow, but it keeps the doors open." Persistent constraint of silt/rot shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Butterfly dust as micro-setting constrains choices ("mark with chalk the window seams") and charges final image ("dust lifts and resettles"); sensory hierarchy (visual fractures, tactile silt) reflects researcher's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (practical salvage) signaled early tightens texturally via dust forensics and triage, narrowing to half-light reopen; cost felt in "compost the dead" foreclosing full restoration. Agency in micro-choices coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dignified decay emerges via shifting pulsar/orchid images, reweighting premise in final "plan refines itself without fuss"; resonant non-literal answer in dust resettling avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (star gradients, slope metaphors) biases noticing; rhythmic control heightens lyric pressure, stable first-person with no leakage. Botanist dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm passes ear test; figurative coherence in decay/star patterns taught early, minor overwrite in reflective beats ("rhyme is enough") doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of neutron-star forensics to butterfly-dust maps transforms recovery trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure inevitable in hindsight via "slopes are where work happens."</comment>
