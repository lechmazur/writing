<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied through resonant perceptions like "crooked pathways"; final renunciation to "keep listening" earned by layered family refusals with noose-cost felt in abdication memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via waves revealing layered secrets; CR closure in "crossed the bridge I built" reconfigures dynasty-end with conceptual cost of encoded refusal legible in portrait cavity moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sepia room vividly selective (dust/leather/citrus narrowing to shivers/rattles); portrait seam and crank fit constrain key choice, charging final image as shadows thicken to witness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover truth deepens accumulatively through wave-etched plate and notes; agency in winding/turning forecloses reigning path with cost crystallized in "task was not to reign, but to keep listening."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resonant refusal emerges organically from grandmother's encoded waves and father's hair coil; final image non-literally answers via bridge-crossing repricing mercy's noose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in sonic metaphors ("standing waves...ribs"); rhythmic control modulates from patient tremors to decayed smoke, heightening intuition under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (horn as "judge withholding sentence") integrated into action; no loops/artifacts, propulsion varies rhythmically without overwriting in peak revelations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics and dynastic intrigue via waves stitching secrets; risk in lyric resonance transforms hidden-truth trope, inevitable in hindsight at tin's bloom.</comment>
