<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of doubt and hope act simultaneously from opening ("doubt walks beside my hope") and compel the final apology to the father, earned through bone-setting parallel; flaws like winter misjudgment drive inevitable struggle with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of clues (tin badge, tooth, sap map) tightens to chamber discovery; on-page closure via carrying boy home and giving tooth reconfigures skepticism with conceptual cost of self-forgiveness, legible in "I had been wrong in winter."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pear tree "stitched with moths" and bark map constrain choices by revealing path; foxgloves and root stairs as micro-setting charge final chamber image, filtered through bonesetter's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving boy's disappearance deepens accumulatively via tooth key and fox leg parallel, forcing agency in bone-setting; cost of past misjudgment paid in father's tears and narrator's admission, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of myth/logic cleft emerges organically from reed substitute to garden's "lullaby" chamber; final image of crescent tooth kissed reweights premise without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in "patient with mysteries that earn their keep."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in bone/measuring metaphors ("marrow ought to hum") modulates rhythm under pressure; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual (boy's "garden borrowed children"), stable first-person without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but figurative layering ("tree-knuckle rafters") borders overwriting in peak chamber beat without obscuring; no loops, rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope through bone-setting as belief metaphor, synthesizing folkloric garden with clinical skepticism; fresh "nails like seeds" and tooth key hinge inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
