<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Locksmith's motivation intensifies through embodied actions like tasting the hair, earning the release; scholar's internal conflict dramatized via childhood voice heard at door. Minor slip: scholar's traits archetypal without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Strong micro-choices reveal values, as in "oaths that open only when a life admits its longing."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from door's shiver to inward opening, RR closure with cost in "unspoken mercy had begun to ache like a phantom limb" and valley reeling. Orientation anchored early in hill/roads/valley; single scene coherent. No causality breaks; star breathing pays off pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus and starlight constrain choices (wait for first star, exhales against keyhole); star charges final image as "lantern in slow breath." Sensory hierarchy selective via locksmith's ear to grain; crickets and blackthorn evolve with events. Micro-setting (door freestanding on moonlight) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped idea) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sister revelation and door's whisper, narrowing to permission to love. Cost legible in phantom ache and "shame scraped away"; agency in locksmith's alignment of past/present. Minor abstractness in stakes before hair's reprise slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken mercy emerges organically from hair/idea release, resonant CR in scholar passing through to "hill and three roads... as if they had never left." Subtext in silences/gestures like ribbon fade; ambiguity lingers in "dignity of having witnessed." No moralizing; counter-readings in sister's "kindness as weakness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stable, perceptual signature in "keyring that made no sound"; rhythm modulates from hushed to swelling longing. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("There are keys that are not metal"); no head-hopping, elision taught early via silences. Voice particular: syntax reflects patience, as in "rubs and pauses."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; opening anchors stakes poetically. Minor overwrite: figurative density (e.g., "tides push the shore toward itself") risks muddle in peak door-opening but pattern-taught as lyric mode. No loops; concrete images replace generics, though occasional strain like "clerks keeping sly records."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: idea-locking door opened by hair-tongue-star transforms locksmith trope into mercy's release. Risky lyric structure heightens cosmic stakes; irreplaceable turn in door opening inward inevitable from particulars. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity in "containers exist only so that something can leave them."</comment>
