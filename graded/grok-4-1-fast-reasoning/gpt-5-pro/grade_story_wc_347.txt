<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reluctant duty rooted in debt drives micro-choices like nut-flicking with embodied resentment ("rust resents salt"); contradictory impulses surface in pruning choices; final endurance forecloses escape, emptying self with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from past nut to strangers' guidance; orientation anchors early in orchard/labyrinth; closure's Charged Poise in nut handoff and self-leaving reconfigures knowing with "crooked sweetness" cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinth terraces and mechanical birds constrain impressions-without-touching tactics; sensory details like "brass feathers ticking" and "copper and thyme" bias via caretaker's priorities; frost islands charge final turn-back image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pre-frost guidance tightens via strangers' arrival and bird patrols; agency in dust-shivering and nut sabotage narrows options; self-emptying cost legible in "giving directions empties me of myself."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Curse's perfect direction erasing wandering emerges via whispering fruit and blueprint nut; final "forget the blueprint" image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in crooked sweetness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "penny bright mourning" and exact quiet voice; stable first-person focalization biases toward wind-like guidance; minimal dialogue fits offhand exactness, advancing calm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from dawn memory to switchback; metaphors like "shadows leaned" integrate purposefully without muddle or loops; no scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nut-blueprint memory and impressions-without-touching transforms guidance trope; graceless birds and orchard whispers commit boldly to premise, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
