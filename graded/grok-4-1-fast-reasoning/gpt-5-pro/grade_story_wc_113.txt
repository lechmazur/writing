<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (tell someone vs. subtle disruption via wrong note) act simultaneously; final micro-choice of harsh harmonic earned by prior code-unraveling with embodied anxiety cost in steadying hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stain-messages density builds to RR closure (evacuation averts collapse, program warms/fades with felt cost of unspoken gratitude); orientation anchored in opening line, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (water smelling of rope/varnish, lantern shivers on creases) filtered via musician bias constrains code-tracing and charges final moon-through-cornice image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel ghost code to save mezzanine) signaled early; agency-deepening in disruptive harmonic forecloses rehearsal path, escalation via message cadence reweights with on-page cost of sliced-air pause triggering groan/collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of tuning in-between spaces emerges organically from particulars (rests/ripples/ghost prints); final image ("ghost lives there... answer") offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musical diction ("unstruck chords," "downbeat," "fermata") modulates rhythmically under stress; stable first-person POV with purposeful compression legible to charged silence-mirroring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "tightened my bow, slid the program under my shirt"); figurative pattern (music/water) taught early without muddle in peak disruption beat, minor density slips non-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-code in water-stained program disrupts via musical heresy; transforms haunted-theater trope through in-between-spaces premise with risk-taking poetic voice heightening closure charge.</comment>
