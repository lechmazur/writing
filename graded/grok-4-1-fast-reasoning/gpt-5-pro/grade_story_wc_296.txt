<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Issa's guarded serenity and contradictory guilt propel micro-choices like pricking her palm and whispering "unbend," earning the release with embodied cost in tasting "bile and iron." Internal conflict acts simultaneously in the ritual, not summarized. Final renunciation of bindings feels compelled by her unflinching confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seed unfurls after blood, eats spells to reveal confession, then bindings, culminating in Charged Poise as lake reflects her "room inside her armor" with clean ache as cost. Orientation anchors immediately in reeds and vortex. Persistent constraint of ice and rings shapes every tactic to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Swirling drowned trees and orbiting apples constrain rituals, evolving as branches breathe and paths divide post-release. Ice disk charges final blank reflection. Sensory selection (shiver of roots, apples like helmets) mirrors her tactical calm without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unbind truth escalates via deepening density: blood activates seed, confession implicates her hands, forcing release of woven rings. Agency in expanding circles narrows options; blood and ache as visible prices alter tactics to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of deception's veils undone emerges implicitly from seed gnawing spells, reading confession aloud, to final self-reflection in blank lake. Orchard's release reweights mirrors' lie without statement. Ache provides resonant, non-literal answer with lingering ambiguity of forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias: notices "knotting current" and "skeletal letters" through druidic lens. Poetic diction like "wind knits a hush like armor" rhythms with intensity, compressing under stress. No elision; voice particular and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short commands amid lyric swells). Metaphors cohere in pattern (armor, spears, moons) without muddle in peak seed-binding beat. No loops or scaffolds; final line recharges dawn image crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: seed devours spells to unveil ice-trapped patricide, transforming mirror tropes via orchard vortex and blood-ritual unbinding. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from failed trick to ready room inside armor.</comment>
