<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's characterization shines through concrete interiority and micro-choices like handing Neris the ledger for Daro's name, revealing thoughtful flaws balanced by guilt from "last winter I read a torn flag as consent." Contradictory impulses emerge in carrying mothers' breaths while insisting on plain words, earning the final stewardship. Voice particular and embodied; relationships crucible via Neris/Bram apologies. 9+ test met: impulses act in scene, choice earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with immediate orientation ("storm-worn windblown parapet in mist"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure in "I will keep choosing neutral territory," reconfiguring ongoing stake with felt cost of recycled mistakes. One tightening via Daro's refusal narrows options. No orientation debt; lens clear; cost legible in final chest click and mist lift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through POV: mist "thinning and thickening as if breathing," parapet "holds its breath," drawer pull "cold as gull bone" constrains rituals and charges final "clicks like a small bell." Sensory hierarchy urgent, weather/tide affect crossings; recurring mist/object mirror internal hush. 9+ test: recurring drawer pull charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful exchange with true apologies) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Daro's refusal forcing Neris's specific naming, narrowing to "bridgeless span." Agency in negotiator's ledger insistence forecloses haste; cost visible in "tremor" and ungloved palms. Escalation coherent under lens; enters 8+ via trade-off but minor abstractness in ethical calculus caps below 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stewarding "between apology and forgiveness" emerges organically from orchard raid/net apologies and ledger griefs, resonating in final "gulls seem to practice forgiveness less grudgingly." Subtext in silences/images avoids morals; irony in past boys' limp-home charges complexity. 9+ test: ending reweights question non-literally via mist-lift/chest image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("tongue and heart argue"); stable first-person, no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but subtextual/natural: Neris's "hunger taught him cruelty" advances via implication. Rhythm modulates tension; non-standard poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. 9+ test: signature/rhythm excel under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("light flickering like minnows"); rhythm varies, no loops though "furrowed hush"/drawer pull motif repeats intentionally. Minor overwriting in mist-breathing metaphors risks coherence in peak Daro beat, dulling propulsion slightly. Zero scaffold; propulsion strong to closure click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh poetic lens on negotiation transforms prisoner exchange via moon-tide rituals and ledger of griefs into inevitable Charged Poise. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; drawer pull synthesis memorable, no derivatives. 9+ test: non-obvious angle inevitable in hindsight, risk elevates (+0.3).</comment>
