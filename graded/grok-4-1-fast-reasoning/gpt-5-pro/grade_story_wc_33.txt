<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in mother's teaching and patience under drone pressure; contradictory impulses shine in "respectfully rebellious" choices like bowing to the lens while dodging; final collaborative fostering earned with visible relational cost in risks shared with the ledger woman.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as absences and crossings build density to CR closure in "border hums a smaller song," reweighting division with undeniable social cost; orientation anchored early in arcade and drop; one tightening via commander threat answered by silence suffices, with bottle use as motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thunderstorm bottle as micro-setting constrains drone crossing choice and charges final natural storm image; cobalt arcade and sweaty bricks selective, tactile, POV-biased; weather evolves causally to affect gatherings without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing promises via absences tightens through drone hesitation and commander threat, forcing endurance with on-page cost in "politely amplified silence"; agency in linking blanks and unstoppering bottle drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mending via absences emerges organically from sorting non-writers to gatherings, culminating in resonant CR of self-rising storm without moralizing; final image reweights borders through laughter and tears amid hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "routes through silence" and "absences sketch the living map"; rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, stable single POV; boy's nod and woman's ledger exchange carry subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "drones blinking like dragonflies" coherent and pattern-taught for lyric mode; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in crossing beat purposeful, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman linking absences against drone borders transforms smuggling trope into reparative pledge; risk-taking in mosaic evenings and bottle magic heightens stakes organically; final smaller hum inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
