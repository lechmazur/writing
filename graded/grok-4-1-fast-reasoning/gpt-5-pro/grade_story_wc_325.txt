<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Claustrophobia and duty contradict in embodied tidal waits and hand-warming despite rib-compressing fear; final "fear now lined itself up behind duty" earns endurance with visible cost of repeated returns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds from gold fleck quiver to "file index blinked awake," landing Charged Poise closure in whispered "Return" promise with conceptual cost of perpetual tides.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal "sump slackened" and cable "crooning interference" constrain timing and methods, charging final "caves sealed their throats" image; sensory hierarchy reflects Ivo's invisible-tracking bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant vigil stake signaled early tightens via signal "braid of clicks" recognition under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance choice with flood-risk cost legible in siren toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unremembered persistence emerges implicitly from name-speaking and chirp-laughter; final "shimmer of attention riding the sheath" reconfigures erasure with lingering conceptual cost, no moral stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("tracks invisible things," "caves breathed like lungs") stable in single close-third POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in "short long long short" without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern ("phase transitions," "pale fish turning") propels without loops or muddle; rhythm varies in peak signal rise, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech-vigil ritual via electroscope and phase thawing transforms ghost-signal trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable "archives learned to say their names."</comment>
