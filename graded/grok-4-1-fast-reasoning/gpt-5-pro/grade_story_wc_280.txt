<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through synesthetic embodiment (e.g., "pears chime... plums hum"); contradictory impulses as listener producing echoes compel higher-stakes coaxing; Rowan's change earned via coin/blueprint discovery with felt cost of abandonment confronted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from synesthetic cues to echo relaxation of timeline; closure as Charged Poise in Rowan's commitment ("Please keep the path tomorrow") reconfigures despair to action with cost of prior gray budgets legible; orientation anchored early in theater/orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid synesthetic details (e.g., "light splashes over leaves in notes I can taste, bittersweet lime") constrain choices like luring Rowan and charge final hammers-in-plum image; setting evolves causally as hedges rearrange post-coin flip.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving Rowan's possibility) signaled early, escalates via ghost's echo-agency tightening maze to blueprint reveal; one deepening forecloses despair path with visible cost in blueprint's cinnamon-bronze revival charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of echoes reviving possibility emerges organically from orchard particulars shifting to "lime turned honey"; final knot image offers resonant answer reweighting despair without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("hear color, taste footsteps") biases noticing with rhythmic control; Rowan's brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("Please keep the path"); stable first-person POV with purposeful lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated into propulsion (e.g., "time here is a fractured timeline pruned into spirals"); minor figurative density in peak beats coherent via synesthesia pattern, no loops; rhythm varies with scene breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic ghost/orchard echoes transforms reprise trope into timeline-threading stakes; risk-taking in perceptual voice heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
