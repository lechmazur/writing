<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Philosopher's consistent pattern-seeing compels teaching choices with embodied calm under Li's hunger pressure; Li's frown on riddles reveals practical contradiction evolving to palm-slamming cadence; minor archetype familiarity in sage but earned change via new knot without safety-hedge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from net tears to Yazhen revelation to foam-map lesson, tightening via pattern recognition; Charged Poise closure in elders' surprised "subtle ache" reconfigures restraint-with-release, cost legible in foreclosed blame path and hunger-consent; orientation anchors early in parapet/tea scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory weave (sweating stones' bead-drops, firefly confetti, slug cursive) filters through philosopher's pattern bias, constraining descent via moon-pooled lanterning; parapet bookends charge final rinsing image, evolving causally with rain/fireflies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nets/thief vs debts/hunger) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to mercy-reveal and knot-lesson tightening options; agency in philosopher's whistle/descent yields trade-off crystallization, cost in elders' healing bruise palpable on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patterned compassion emerges implicitly via nets-as-water-intentions, foam gyres, moon loops shifting from blame to open justice; final fireflies-as-commas reprise reweights without moral, lingering ambiguity in hunger-compromise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with philosopher's perceptual signature (gyres as nets, whistle echoes like silk); sparse dialogue subtextual (Li's "hunger does not love riddles"), natural idiom distinction; rhythm modulates from somber froth to dusk gathering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via varied openings/syntax, high density in image-action fusion (whisk blooming anemone to foam sketches); minor density slip in stacked figures ("puckering lips into small whistle" adjacent metaphors coherent but thick) but no loops, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms sage-thief trope via gill-mimic knots and foam maps, risking lyric compression that heightens pattern stakes; final "foam's brief constellations" inevitable reprise feels singular vision.</comment>
