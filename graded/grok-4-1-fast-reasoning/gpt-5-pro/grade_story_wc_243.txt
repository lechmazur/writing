<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (e.g., "palming the locket photo that has warmed against me"); contradictory impulses in making ache "useful" earn final endurance of duty with felt cost of absence, unmarred by slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from ritual buildup to Charged Poise closure in final sea pulses and locket clasp; cost legible in "haunted euphoria... both chapel and scar," with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Jetty micro-setting (tide inhales, salt roses) constrains timing and charges final image of yield/return; sensory selection POV-biased and purposeful, no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of covenant renewal tightens via density of adjustments and ink blooms narrowing to signing with absence's cost; under Accumulative lens, ritual endurance forecloses unraveling path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of proximate acts over spells emerges via ledger as "skin we grow back," final image non-literally reweights loss into salvageable music without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("murmur... legible," "gulls hinge silence") and rhythmic modulation sustain single first-person POV; Kellen dialogue subtextual and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "ink blooms around the oval like a tideline"); figurative language patterned/lyric without muddle or loops, rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink ritual transforms sea-covenant trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable "quiet, salvageable music" closure.</comment>
