<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grim optimist's contradictory impulses—climbing while tasting "iron of missed chances"—act in scene, earning final endurance of proof-pocketed ascent with visible cost of perpetual obligation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of proofs and dice rolls builds to rupture's pattern break; CR closure lands in "stair beneath me stop while I keep ascending," reweighting regret with undeniable cost of endless duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Infinite staircase and chipped die constrain choices (e.g., "roll the dice and follow the numbers") and charge final image ("pocket the pair of dice... climb toward a horizon that repeats"); sensory hierarchy (chalk dust, light leak) mirrors internal ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove perpetual motion) signaled early, tightens texturally at rupture/bargain forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in "motion persists... as obligation," though abstract edges toward declaration narrow agency slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of desire as memory-fueled machine emerges organically from dice/proof particulars; final image ("proof in my chest, texture under my tongue") offers resonant CR repricing without moral, reweighting initial miss into holdable texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (mathematical topology, textured nap/grain) modulates rhythmically under pressure; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly in charged closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "dice, one chipped" (three recurrences) and occasional elevated register drift ("topology of vows and remainders") dull peak beats slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math proofs on infinite staircase transforms regret trope into textural perpetual motion machine; risk of lyric ascent heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via early dice seed to pocketed closure.</comment>
