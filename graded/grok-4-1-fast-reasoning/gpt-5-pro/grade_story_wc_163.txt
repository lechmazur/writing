<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to learn belonging rooted in prior non-belonging drives micro-choices like charting with feather; embodied doubt folds into glow early. Mara applies gentle crucible pressure via tales and shared ritual. Minor slip: emotions verge on unearned lyric epiphany in "map at last include me."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of breaths, plankton, shrimps builds to generator hesitation as pattern break, resolving in sunrise mosaics CR/RR with cost of folded doubt. Orientation anchored by airlock by ~100 words. One tightening via feather-stirred plankton suffices; closure legible with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome, vents, plankton constrain ritual choices and charge final mosaic image; anemones in fountains mirror belonging motif via action. Sensory hierarchy poetic-POV specific: "plankton lit the dome with luminous respite." Recurring dome/plankton evolve causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging rhythm) signaled early, tightens texturally via hesitation forcing feather micro-agency, foreclosing isolation path. Cost felt in "doubt, folding it into the glow"; pressure coheres quietly to Charged Poise at "map include me."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges from breath rituals, shrimps-as-fireflies, mosaic dancers; final gold path/sunrise reconfigures premise non-literally with resonance. No moralizing; particulars like feather smudging avoid platitudes. Subtext in shared exhale layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable, perceptual signature (coastlines/constellations) biases noticing; rhythm modulates from hush to bloom. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("city not dead, only patient"). No head-hopping; diction controlled poetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud but figurative density in hesitation beat ("shimmering heartbeat, slip a chapter") borders overwriting (−0.5); minor paraphrase loops on "luminous respite"/ritual (−0.2). High density propels accumulatively; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astrologer charts drowned city via feather/shrimps-fireflies, transforming underwater trope into breath-belonging lyric. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes; final manta/mosaic inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
