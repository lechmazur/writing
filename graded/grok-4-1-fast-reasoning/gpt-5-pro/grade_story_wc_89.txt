<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction and embodied emotion, as in "Grief wants me to break; love wants me to bend; the moon wants witness," compel the metamorphosis choice with clear cost to human form. Micro-choices like pressing fortune to tongue reveal values hierarchy. Final endurance of paradox honors flaws without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from spices to animal arrivals to transformation, yielding on-page Resonant Reconfiguration where birds meet with felt cost of relinquished humanity. Orientation anchors immediately in orchard arrival. No lens ambiguity; persistent spice constraint shapes every tactic to charged closure image of feather-speech reunion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spice vials and stone as micro-settings constrain conjuring choices, evolving with causal heat into lung-mapped constellations that charge final ember-shape walk. Sensory hierarchy privileges scent under urgency, filtering through beast-whisperer bias. Orchard's leaning trees and hoofbeats subtly pressure the ritual without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bond-reforging escalates accumulatively via spice-road enabling animal permissions and story-telling, narrowing to reluctant wing-ache trade-off. Protagonist agency in eating fortune forces stance crystallization. Minor abstractness in "true hearing requires slow mathematics" slightly mutes one tightening, but cost legibility peaks in "shoulders ache for widening bones."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bonds demanding metamorphosis emerges organically from spice particulars and beast counsel, reweighting human limits in bird-kiss image without moralizing. Subtext in fox's "Halfway is a bridge" layers cosmic intimacy with relational cost. Final feather-speech offers non-literal answer to hearing-beyond-death question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice sustains perceptual signature through spice-galaxies and feathered vowels, modulating rhythm with pressure via shortening lines in transformation. Animal speech carries subtext and distinction without ventriloquism. Purposeful compression teaches pattern early, paying off in legible ember reunion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but dense figuratives like "petals glistening like small moons" verge on overwrite in opening without full pattern restraint, slightly dulling propulsion before ritual peak. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies read-aloud. Closure image of comet-kiss remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-cookie prophecy, spice-barter ritual, and beast-mediated phoenix-aftermath transforms resurrection trope into inevitable bird-reunion with cosmic-risk payoff. Spice-constellations and reluctant feather-shift feel particular and irreplaceable. Bold lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
