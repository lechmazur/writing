<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Confession beat earned by contradictory impulses like pausing mid-launch and paddling despite excuses; internal flaws (prideful error) drive micro-choices with relational cost at sister's bow-holding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density tightens to Charged Poise closure in pole-naming; cost legible in "done hoarding apologies" and regrets' shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Utility poles constrain channel crossing and charge final naming image, mirroring internal drift; sensory details like "hull kissed the water" integrate with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confess accident) deepens texturally via nearing-shore rhythm shift, forcing stance crystallization; cost in every "inch of tide and excuse" viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ending's pole-naming reweights navigation/regret premise non-literally as "faith as wick refusing to die," emerging organically from compass/poles without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in metaphors like "gulls stitched errant commas" modulates with pressure; stable first-person lyricism sustains without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but minor paraphrase loops in mid-paddle regret beats slightly drag without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Navigating by coastal utility poles transforms regret trope into fresh redemption synthesis, inevitable in pole-naming closure.</comment>
