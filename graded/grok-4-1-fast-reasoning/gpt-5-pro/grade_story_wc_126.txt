<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find beauty in the unfinished drives consistent micro-choices like answering drops "close but not exact," culminating in earned refusal of perfection that forecloses tidy resolution with communal cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via violin scratches "out stars" then backing away. Boy and diver apply relational pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo tuning to communal fire/dive/bell, tightening via pattern break when hush "cracks like thin ice." Closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page in "hush learns to listen...breathe behind voices," reconfiguring silence with conceptual endurance cost; bowl-to-buoy evolution shows motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain choices (leaks for tuning, ribs for fire/echoes) and charge final image ("ship ribs flicker, orchard glass brightens"). Acoustic sensory hierarchy via Mara's perception sharpens urgency; details evolve causally (trees bloom in salt, fruit knocks applause).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind hush) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via boy/group arrival, fire stories, bell retrieval narrowing options to imperfect play; agency in "refusing perfection...inviting errors to sing" forces trade-off with felt cost in persistent hush. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished beauty emerges from particulars (off-note tuning, scratched stars, cracked bell yielding "honey"); final image "unfinished keeps time...we keep each other" resonantly reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of enduring hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct acoustic perceptual signature ("chart a room by how silence bends") biases noticing; lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged closure rhythm. Stable third-person close POV; late "we" convergence intentional for communal poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (hush as "hand...knot," notes as "ladders of breath") without muddle, varying rhythm accelerates to "spoons, shoes, bottles" cacophony. No loops/artifacts; closure image pulses cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh post-burn eco-lyric synthesis transforms silence trope via acoustic communal unbinding; risk-taking in poetic elision heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from bowl-bell arc.</comment>
