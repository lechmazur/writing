<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to sculpt patience is embodied in "restless pulse" and micro-choices like the needle demo, earning the council's shift with visible risk of failure; contradictory impulses act in scene via impatience tamed by lunar watch. Kerr applies targeted pressure without diluting focus. Final renunciation of haste feels inevitable from prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of moon-viaduct patterns builds to on-page closure in "patient revolution... arrives like thaw," a Charged Poise reconfiguring speed's harness with conceptual cost of foregone haste. Orientation anchors by line 2 ("basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake"); one tightening at demo forecloses blind speed. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: viaduct's "hums and tugs" dictate lunar crossing timing, charging final image of "tide tamed enough to pull us home." Sensory hierarchy (wind, frost smoke, needles stirring) filters through POV's patient gaze, vivid yet selective. Micro-setting (slate, iron slivers) enables pivotal demo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (speed's blind harness vs patient mapping) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at needle demo and successful crossing, narrowing options with risk of "return barren." Agency via attention/leadership drives escalation; cost legible in unyoking dogs despite their tremble. Moral calculus between haste's survival and patience's rhythm charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges organically from viaduct pulls, moon arcs, and unyoking, answered non-literally in "patience acquires a body and learns to stand" reweighting haste as trap. Subtext in silences (needles slacken) and images avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in retained running "when danger asks."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("steps... tracing lines across ice and cloud") biases toward lunar patience; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, compressing at crossing ("slip across... sleeping animal"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Kerr's "dream drunk" to nod). Stable first-person, no head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion vary rhythm (short crossing sentences vs reflective arcs); purposeful motifs like "unyoke" avoid loops. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("aurora smudged like thumbprints") slightly muddles one high-pressure beat but pattern-taught and closure-clear. No scaffolds, artifacts, or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magnetite viaduct as humming antagonist with lunar patience transforms survival trope; risk-taking in poetic texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final "horizon keeps widening" feels inevitable from mapped pauses, authentic vision coheres.</comment>
