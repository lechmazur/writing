<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "memories rose to dispute his right to proceed... he answered in the language of creek stones," revealing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final endurance of grief earns change with felt cost in the harbor within. Minimal flaws balance competence without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to clearing; on-page Charged Poise closure as "he traced the tone into those grooves" reconfigures emotional navigation with conceptual cost of prior sorrow. Orientation anchors immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Platinum ring and skin as micro-settings constrain choices, charging final image; ultrasonic forest's "syllables of sap and spores" filter through POV bias, evolving tactilely to guide climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively via memories' opposition and deer's warning, forcing endurance; cost legibly felt in "seams became a net that kept him from splitting when grief pressed," narrowing to stillpoint agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sensory mapping emerges organically from skin absorption to "maps thereafter were patience arranged on skin and page"; final image reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of inner harbor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker's skin-language synthesis transforms sensory tropes into fresh emotional dowsing; risk-taking in ultrasonic conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via ring's reprise.</comment>
