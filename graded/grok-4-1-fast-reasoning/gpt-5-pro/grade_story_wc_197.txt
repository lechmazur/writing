<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength: Jessa's resourcefulness drives micro-choices like patching the relay and bridging wires, earning her endurance with visible risk. Weakness: Interiority leans poetic over embodied contradiction, softening internal conflict in the tunnel escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening to CR closure: "The auric water flared...mirrored not the stars but the erased," reweighting histories with social cost as neighbors witness. Orientation anchored early in alleys/lagoon; no shards, causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Auric lagoon and puddles constrain choices (map to hatch, lights flicker via key) and charge final flare image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (mineral glow, sweating walls); vivid, selective integration via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve node/contact) signaled early, escalates via contact's voice then squads' surge under textural lens; Jessa's jamming forecloses path with cost (grid spill, escape). One decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stubborn custodianship emerges organically from relay injection and lagoon CR, offering non-literal answer via "even their scripts do not include how to arrest light." Resonance from particulars avoids morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (puddles as maps, grates striping cables); stable close-3rd modulates rhythm with pressure. Minimal dialogue natural ("I am in the culvert"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax/openings; high density in climax ("jams key...kicked it loose") despite figurative saturation. Minor metaphor density (-0.3) in tunnel but no muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Puddle-map to auric flare transforms revision trope via grounded poetry; fresh synthesis of relic tech/resistance feels inevitable, risking lyric over plot for heightened resonance.</comment>
