<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory skepticism and imaginative bending culminate in the earned release of father's memory, with micro-choices like whispering and secret-telling revealing flaws and values under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding epiphanies. Final renunciation of the memory passes through with felt personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens holds: breadcrumb trail causally leads to panel, secret, and star-aligned opening as DC closure with legible cost in personal memory release. Orientation anchors early in city of fountains. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fountains and shadows constrain choices (e.g., shards in gutters guide path, pitch gums panel), charging final image of running water. Sensory details like "cooled tar" and "gummy with pitch" filter through POV urgency. Recurrent heron and lanterns evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to liberate memories escalates via failed whispers, stuck panel, and patience-testing alignment, driven by agency; one tightening at star-match forecloses impatience option with conceptual cost reweighted in city awakening. Coherent pressure under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tested faith emerges organically from skeptic's bending and memory release, resonating in final image of "defiant hush that promised a chorus" without moralizing. Particulars like glass bread and father's pump lesson reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with distinct perceptual bias (light over water, rules bent slowly) modulates rhythmically under rising pressure; no head-hopping, elisions purposeful and pattern-taught. Syntax reflects patient mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "wind smelling of pepper and lilacs" purposeful in release beat, no loops or muddle. Varied rhythm supports lyric accumulation; zero scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic quest in poetic fantasy world transforms tropes via glass breadcrumbs and constellation key; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
