<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptive map framer's motivation to interpret silence drives micro-choices like calling the librarian instead of forcing the panel, embodied in "I could not wrench it, and I would not force it." Internal conflict between curiosity and respect acts simultaneously without alternating summaries; final promise to reopen doors slowly earns closure with felt cost of patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences, tears, and drafts builds to CR closure in framing pollen maps mentally and stitching the chart as invitation, reweighting borders with conceptual cost of whispering respect. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; video comparison provides one meaningful tightening without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rain-scoured fresco vault and salt-bloomed parchment constrain choices (draft reveals mechanism, lichens hide handle); recurring crescent (map tear to abrasion) charges final stitched scar image. Sensory hierarchy (shy gray eyes, hissing hinge) filters through methodical POV, evolving causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopening chapel's silence empathetically) signaled early tightens texturally via video abrasion discovery narrowing to patient press, forcing trade-off of force vs. whisper with cost in counted breaths before entry. Escalation driven by agency under lens; moral calculus of mercy vs. intrusion legible but lacks one live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shielded openness emerges organically from particulars like ribbon draft and pollen maps, culminating in non-literal CR: "some places reopen when you whisper to them," reweighting map-longing without moralizing. Resonance from conflicting images (torn throat vs. breathing panel) invites ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in ear/throat/whisper diction modulates rhythmically with intensity (short breaths before entry); stable first-person focalization biases toward silences and fibers. Purposeful compression teaches lyric pattern early, paid off in charged poise of mental framing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture or image, e.g., "salt blooms in the fibers, as if rain had been arguing with the past." Varied syntax and zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere without muddle, passing read-aloud test through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map restoration as empathetic silence-reading transforms folklore trope via video mechanics and pollen charts; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitably toward whispered reopening. No derivative echoes; bold frame feels singular and memorable.</comment>
