<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority via synesthetic perceptions (e.g., "palms tasting iron," "lullabies as thyme and solder"); contradictory impulses in splitting paths propel earned redirection with closure cost of redrawn maps. Final choice to unseal aligns with seeded bridge nature, balancing competence and distortion-fear origin without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to pattern break at crate unsealing, delivering CR closure ("maps redraw themselves... channels for what deserves to move") with legible conceptual cost of distributed weight in final gantry walk. Orientation anchored early ("concrete lip of an abandoned spaceport repair bay"); one tightening via cyclic surge suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard and bay constrain choices (wedge into seam, climb gantry) and charge final image (left as "bead in the loom"); sensory hierarchy (coolant "mint and burned dust") reflects POV bias, integrated into action without stalls. Environment mirrors internal pull evolving to luminous tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weight of withheld truth) signaled early, escalates via deepening paths/silence mass under Accumulative lens to agency-driven redirection; cost unmistakable ("weight lifts... lighter because carried by many") foreclosing hoarding path in closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth's gravitational pull emerges organically from logs/crate/voices, resonant CR final image ("bridges do not hoard weight; they distribute it") reweights premise without moralizing; particulars like voices' "thyme and solder" yield complexity over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("chimes... braid taste and color onto air") with rhythmic modulation under stress; purposeful compression in leaps taught early, stable first-person distance enhances lyric texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; dense figuration consistent in pattern (braids/threads/weaving) without muddle or loops in peak unsealing beat. Minor density drag in mid-metaphors (e.g., repeated "braid") subtracts slightly but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory cartography and multiversal braiding transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in cyclic lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable CR realization from particulars feels bold and coherent.</comment>
