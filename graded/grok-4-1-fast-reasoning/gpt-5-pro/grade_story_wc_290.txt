<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—claustrophobia in "lungs took careful, measured sips" versus adventure in ladder climb—act simultaneously to compel the organ play; final promise earned by patient micro-choices with embodied cost. Voice-specific flaws like self-deception in preferring "open lies to tight truths" complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of spatial imagery builds to seam opening; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with "air tightened" cost when chord crumbles and seam closes, reconfiguring mutiny into parley. Orientation anchored early in nexus/church; one tightening via key presses suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rose window frames star-prick choice constraining compass use and charges final nexus image; tactile details like "wood complained beneath my boot" and "pipes like silver birches" evolve with mutiny, mirroring internal states through goal-action. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—key retrieval amid mutiny—tightens accumulatively via organ harmonics narrowing options to non-bruising transfixion; agency in "pressed down a key" forecloses force with legible cost in "careful not to panic as the air tightened."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wistful patience emerges organically from particulars like nail-as-key etching coordinates; final "nail...warmed...grandmother blink" offers non-literal resonant reweighting of mutiny premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of "necessary mouth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with spatial perceptual signature ("alleys froze mid slither") modulates rhythmically under loft pressure; stable first-person distance biases noticing to angles/shadows, teaching poetic compression early for legible closure elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (mutiny as "sly waltz"/"waking pet") propels without loops; minor overwriting in loft metaphors ("shadows pooled like spilt ink") borders density excess but stays voice-motivated and closure-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny premise ingeniously transforms geometry tropes into organ-parley tactics; "pricked the air...seam opened" turn feels inevitable from established pattern, risking bold lyric synthesis without gimmick.</comment>
