<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's meticulous patience and integrity drive concrete micro-choices like studying the pigeon's tube and allying cautiously with the woman, earning the collaborative plan. Interiority is particular and embodied in wind/people analogies, with contradictory solitude vs. alliance impulses acting in the courtyard meeting. Minor abstraction in "nurture integrity" phrasing slightly distances peak emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wary waiting through pigeon message to woman's arrival and plan, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("I waited, letting the wind choose the order of my vows") with legible integrity cost. Single scene oriented early (courtyard at dusk by para 1). No orientation debt; pattern of lateral progression pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard fountain, pigeons, and dusk wind filter through narrator's storm-recorder bias, constraining solitary reflection until woman's intrusion shifts tactics. Recurring wind/storm images evolve causally, charging final "wind choose the order of my vows." Sensory selection (mumbled fountain, velvet motor) mirrors internal moods without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unowned rain truth from quarantine) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pigeon message narrowing to collaborative plan, foreclosing pure solitude with felt comfort cost. Protagonist agency in lateral alliance and bird release drives escalation under lens. Woman's arrival complicates without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient, lateral truth-seeking emerges organically from storm metaphors and unowned report, reweighted in final image of vowed waiting without moralizing. Pigeon hair/thread and fences link particulars to quarantine ambiguity, inviting reflection on integrity's cost. No thematic echo or binaries; complexity lingers in alliance friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct first-person voice with perceptual signature (lateral drift reading, storm patience) stable and biased, modulating rhythm in dialogue ("my work had always been for the unowned"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing plan. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion, lines multi-tasking image/character/pressure (e.g., "pigeon broke from the row... small confession"). Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during reflection ("folded paper boats... velvet motor") risks coherence but pattern-taught; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-recording as lateral espionage in poetic quarantine mystery transforms surveillance trope via "progressing laterally" method. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; final vows feel inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes; voice/ premise cohere authentically.</comment>
