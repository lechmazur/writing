<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses—fear woven into locks that fear back—act in scene via dances and dice rolls, earning the final endurance of locked fear with visible cost in the closing dance circle. Interiority concrete and particular (brine defiance, salt breath). Neri applies targeted pressure without diluting focus. Backstory anchors to present via dice and console.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of dances, entries, dice builds to cadence shift in "tanks exhale like whales," reconfiguring daemon's instinct with felt cost of encrypted vulnerability. Orientation anchored early ("sunken laboratory," "lyrical code breaker"). One tightening via patterned entries suffices; closure Charged Poise legible with price in rising web.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flooded corridors, algae staves, frosted tanks constrain dances and entries, charging final "water blooms with light." Sensory hierarchy (iron taste, dice clack, valve hum) reflects urgency and POV bias. Rust and pressure mirror defiance without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (hangman's dice, leaking bulkhead) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate minds vs. surveillance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through coded entries fooling daemon; one deepening in "last entry posts" narrows options with trade-off of vulnerability. Agency in dances/rolls forces crystallization; cost unmistakable in "trembling... into a key." No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art-coded defiance emerges implicitly from dances encrypting Sora's death into locks; final "hidden city lifting" reweights premise non-literally without moral. Subtext in silences (Neri's iron taste) and images (web holding). Complexity lingers in survival/memory ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (everything as song/rust/dance) stable, rhythmic under pressure; syntax modulates (arcs as grammar). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("survival or memory?"); Neri's directness contrasts. Elisions (daemon learning) taught early, paid in exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short clacks amid long arcs); density high, multi-job lines (e.g., "midnight adds twelve, twelve adds L"). Intentional repetition ("spider spins") pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure. Minor density drag from metaphors in peak ("web finishes") caps below 9; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dance-codes in flooded lab with dice-sums transform tropes organically; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes (surveillance via hips). Final web reprise inevitable from particulars. No derivatives; bold POV on code as song.</comment>
