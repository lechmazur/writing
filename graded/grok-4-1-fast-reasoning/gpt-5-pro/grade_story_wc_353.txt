<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion in "pressed my ear to bark and felt empathy in motion"; motivation intensifies through patient micro-choices like strumming. Minimal contradictory impulses limit 9+, but endurance of gentle alignments over crescendos earns final renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from hedgehog's uncurling to melody steadying air; Charged Poise closure in offering to grove/river with conceptual cost of "no ending, only continuance" reconfigures listening premise. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; lens holds cleanly without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grove and insulator constrain choices (windward copper leaves, thumb cools on glaze) and charge final image ("leave the insulator to dream of sky"); sensory selection biased to tactile empathy, selective and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music from silence) signaled early, textural escalation via density to "phrase arrives... mending fabric"; hedgehog nod tightens permission as micro-turn narrowing options. Cost legible in patience matching insulator's refusal, but low external pressure caps band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-listening emerges organically from particulars like cracks-to-intervals mapping; final image "song will outlive me... quiet grammar" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting creation's endurance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("memory is a resonant thing"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. Stable first-person POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "silence is not the absence of sound but of listening" advances theme/action); metaphors coherent and voice-motivated in lyric mode, no loops or scaffold, propulsion via varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-siren ruins, salvaged wires/spider silk, and tree-empathy transforms quiet creation trope; risk-taking in non-causal accumulative design heightens stakes inevitably to continuance image.</comment>
