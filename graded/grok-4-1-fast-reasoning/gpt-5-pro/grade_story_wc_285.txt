<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—adding layers to shawl yet seeking simplicity—culminating in earned stitching of single line with trembling hands as visible cost. Coachman as secondary applies precise pressure through lifting stitch, revealing protagonist's fear. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown via actions like withdrawing linen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fog/rain/threads builds to Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) as palimpsest distills to "stay, and labor beside," with cost in foreclosed additions felt in lighter linens on crossing. Orientation anchored early via ford/coachman; single scene coherent. Closure image of mist lifting as answer charges premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog, rain gutters ticking, dampened threads constrain choices (tighten stitches, delay crossing) and charge final image (mist lifts in rags, spindrift follows). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: boots sinking, horse steaming reflect internal weight. Recurring river/ferry mirrors simplification without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill promise) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via coachman's lift and river-listening realization, narrowing to one-line renunciation with agency/cost in stitching despite refusal risk. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at crossing; one tightening sufficient. Halfway question on bride refusal makes cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of essential vows emerges organically from thread/river particulars, reweighting palimpsest overload to single channel in resonant final image ("clear line carrying its own shore") without moralizing. Subtext in coachman's "too many names sink it" invites ambiguity on smaller truth. Protagonist arc inextricable from simplification question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in textured, biased noticing (fog "condensed lives," river "chooses one channel"); voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, compressing at stitching. Dialogue subtextual/goal-driven (coachman lifts without pulling), voices distinct (oracular vs introspective). Stable first-person, no leakage; lyric compression taught early, paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful/coherent (rain "stitched eaves," certainty "percolate") in accumulative pattern, varying rhythm supports cadence to hushed fields. Minor overwrite in opening fog descriptors (−0.3) but no loops/artifacts dulling closure stitching image. Clean syntax, vivid verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery vow as palimpsest/river channel, transformed via coachman's ambient wisdom into inevitable "smaller truth floats." Bold lyric risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; final mending of map recharges motifs organically.</comment>
