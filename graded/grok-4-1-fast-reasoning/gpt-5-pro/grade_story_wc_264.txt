<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in job/oath drives choices like offering sleep; embodied in pulse, veins freezing on clock. Contradictory endurance (dreamless for clarity) earns stasis with cost. Minor abstraction in interiority ("smear across places") slightly detaches from micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from train hum to circle-song opening archive, closure as Charged Poise in planting sparks/rippling rails with sleep cost legible ("midnight freezes further inside his veins"). Orientation anchored early ("dreamless freight guard rides... desert ahead"). One tightening via oath/palm suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dune constrains: clock set on sand, pollen brushes boots, brightens post-planting. Sensory vivid/POV-biased (algae dim for letters, railman's circle). Recurring rail/sand/algae evolve, charge final dune breathing back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate sparks) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via superposition/song to archive access. Agency in oath/palm forecloses sleep with vein-freeze cost. Escalation coherent under lens, no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserving futures amid desolation emerges via sparks planting/elsewhere catching, resonant non-literal close ("kettle sings... rescued maybes"). Complexity in dreamless choice avoids tidy moral. Final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sees distant pantries/basements via waves). Lyrical rhythm modulates (wobbling song to rippling rails), diction purposeful ("interference chisels a door"). Pattern-taught elision legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, density high (multi-job lines like "hums... to keep cars from remembering"). Minor overwrite in metaphors ("letters sprouting stems," "glow stitched from rescued maybes") during peak but pattern-consistent; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Quantum-railman synthesis (superposition guard, archive of paths) transforms post-apoc tropes organically. Risky lyric structure heightens ritual stakes; chess clock/dune uniquely inevitable to closure poise.</comment>
