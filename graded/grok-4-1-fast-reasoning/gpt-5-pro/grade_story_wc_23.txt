<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied details like "hands aching" and "press the censer foot into my palm until the skin remembers it," revealing contradictory endurance amid loss; final rest against relic earns stasis with visible physical/emotional cost, satisfying 9+ test without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from hydraulics failure to manual rigging and convoy arrival; on-page Charged Poise closure in "rest my head against the censer foot and sleep...patched by dawn" reconfigures navigation of loss with felt endurance cost, orientation anchored instantly, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring censer foot constrains rigging choice ("thread...lash rope") and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (ozone/rust taste, dish moans) filters through navigator's priorities, micro-setting evolves causally without white-room vagueness, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding Rowan via broken signal tightens accumulatively through body-as-motor agency ("lean my weight into the arc"); cost legible in physical strain and "number of names she can say before crying," driving convoy's safe passage without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bearing loss emerges organically from particulars like stars-as-holes and drowned orchard; final image of "raw solace that tastes like salt" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting migration without moralizing, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("maps are scraps of other people") and rhythmic modulation under stress (short bursts in signals); stable single POV with purposeful poetic compression taught early, no head-hopping or register drift, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "The air tastes of ozone and rust, a recipe for remembering") propels via varied rhythm; figurative density voice-motivated in lyric mode without muddle or loops, though minor synonym echoes (fatten/static) nudge below 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-as-signal, reverse migration along memory channels transforms tropes of guidance/homecoming; censer foot's evolution from altar remnant to counterweight feels inevitable and risky, heightening stakes organically, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
