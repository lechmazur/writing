<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's whimsical traits drive micro-choices like cradling the vine and spinning stories into fiber, earning the arbor's "yes" shiver. Internal conflict subtly emerges in pausing at the snag, with embodied listening over rash action. Village collective adds pressure without muddling single-POV clarity; no deep contradictions limit peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hush to alignment, snag resolved by shadow wheel pivot—"When everything aligns, Lio whispered"—yielding Charged Poise in arbor's shiver and bees' return. On-page closure reconfigures covenant with daily cost legible in "renew together, each morning." Single scene, orientation anchored early; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Verdant arbor pulses with sap stir and leaf glyphs, constraining ritual via alignments that charge final "patient branches." Sensory selectivity (dew hum, rosy pollen) mirrors Lio's priorities; dawn evolution tracks causally to light-catching leaves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (strained covenant) signaled early, tightens via snag and child-pointed wheel under textural lens, forcing tree-grammar speech. Agency in Lio's pressing vine to spindle forecloses disconnection with arbor's "yes" and habit-cost. Escalation reweights belonging without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of whimsy-as-listening emerges via particulars like golden thread sigh, resonant in final "braid of duty and joy" without moralizing. Snag-to-alignment arc inextricable from restoration; ambiguity lingers in daily renewal's quiet price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic voice stable in third-limited, perceptual signature nature-grammars ("pauses like commas where leaves met"). Rhythm modulates hush to chorus; purposeful compression taught early pays in closure image. Sparse dialogue (Lio's whispers, elders) natural, subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "moon combed the leaves, drawing out nerves and veins into glyphs"; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density in ritual build ("breath braided," "golden thread") risks overwrite but pattern-taught as voice; no loops dull climax shiver.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: story-spinning as literal tool weaves mytho-ritual organically, transforming tropes via arbor's grammar. Shadow wheel pivot risks bold, heightens alignment stakes hindsight-inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
