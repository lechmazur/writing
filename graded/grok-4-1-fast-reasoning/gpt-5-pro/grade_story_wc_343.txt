<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct internal voice rooted in sociable curiosity drives micro-choices like kneeling at the hopscotch and translating the hum; embodied emotion in "pressure kisses your teeth" and isolation voiced to rivets feels particular. Minimal contradiction but endurance of isolation earns communal shift at closure without unearned epiphany. Captain Melora's grin and bell add relational crucible without headcount bloat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from murmurations to hopscotch solve to light capture; orientation anchors in first paragraph. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via folding light into dog-ear with felt cost of its "loneliness translated" reconfigures isolation into shared map. One tightening via hopscotch patterns narrows path through birds; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Airship groans, greasy charts, copper net constrain choices like tilting north and rising; starlings' cursive braid mirrors/charges progression to light snag. Sensory hierarchy via apprentice's ear for rivets/hum and thumb-grease tactility filters vividly. Hopscotch dust and crate evolve with action, grounding lyric flight without white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to chart luminance signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hopscotch decode forcing rise through murmurations; agency in noting patterns and folding light forecloses solo isolation. Visible cost in light's craving and crew signing reweights communal terms. Escalation coheres under textural lens without coincidence resolution; moral calculus in welcoming exile sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sociable isolation emerges organically via chatting rivets/birds to shared festival; final image of tucked dog-ear and tea answers connection question non-literally, reweighting prior patterns. Subtext in light's exile mirrors narrator's without overt symbolism; ambiguity lingers in next discovery's poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in anthropomorphic sky/objects ("cursive curtains," "handshake when touch will not do") biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from groan to hum without head-hopping. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Melora's grin/bell); first-person stability apt for lyric intimacy, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "hop, skip, and the box tilt means north by east"; rhythm varies read-aloud, openings diverse. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("silk on a nail," "tea into a cracked cup") during capture slightly muddles peak propulsion, but pattern-taught lyricism sustains clarity to charged closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hopscotch-map solve and phrasebook-as-vessel transform airship trope into fresh polyglot luminance chase; risk of lyric compression pays off in hindsight-inevitable folding. Non-obvious synthesis of birds/chalk/light patterns heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
