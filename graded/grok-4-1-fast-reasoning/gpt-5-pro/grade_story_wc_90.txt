<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Steadfast pacifist motivation compels higher-stakes mercy over warhead force, with embodied contradiction in shadow work bruising neglect; final vow stitches name as caretaker, earning stasis with blood-cost pricking thumb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to RR closure via stitched seam and vowed bargain holding unhealable parts; cost legible in thumb-prick drop and ongoing work, with pattern taught early in tear-map shimmer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear as micro-setting constrains choices (reveals coordinates, lightens weight at threshold) and charges final chest-clutch image; recycled spaceship evolves tactilely from cobbled to quilted under POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pacifist dimension-opening) deepens texturally through shadow work narrowing options, forcing joy/mercy trade-off; agency in stitching yields door-pucker resistance overcome with breath, cost unmistakable in blood and forgiven-memory threads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gentleness-through-shadow-work theme emerges organically from stitching tears and bruises, reweighting premise in final breathing-door image promising open only with continued labor; no moralizing, resonant counter-reading in unhealable bargain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses physics-emotion (gravitationally lighter, braided gravity) with rhythmic poetic compression taught early; POV stable first-person, modulating intensity without slippage, closure legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors (scar-tissue door, lung-room) integrated into action; zero loops or scaffolds, peak stitching beat clear without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of poetic sci-fi (tear-star map, shadow-unlocked dimension) risks lyric physics payoff, transforming tropes into inevitable pacifist home; bold voice-heightened stakes feel singularly authentic.</comment>
