<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied gloomy cheerfulness and contradictory impulses to bust myths yet listen first; micro-choices like settling shell and humming compel the earned apology, foreclosing certainty with emotional cost. Final forgiveness reveals character-particular voice without epiphanies. No safety-hedging; flaws in avoided memory drive the hinge-turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: interactions build density to CR closure where compass realignment and apology reconfigure riddle with forgiveness cost ("altered the past just enough"). Orientation anchored early (observatory, dusk). Single scene tightens meaningfully via memory pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (wind murmurs, chalk snow, tide ghost) filter through POV, constraining choices like aligning shell to dome crack. Micro-setting (cello, shell) charges final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Environment evolves with rain, relighting hearth-like cello.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early, deepens texturally as compass forces personal apology, narrowing to unbound practice with regret cost. Agency in resonant method forecloses solving-as-control. Subtle pressure coheres without reversals, fitting lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (waves hold lightly/let go brightly), reweighting riddle via charged poise in leaving items for wind. Resonant final image answers without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in ongoing conversation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (listening as hinge, laughter truer) with rhythmic modulation under realization pressure. Stable single-POV first-person; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. Prose as character reflects myth-busting poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (dew on glass, fish bumping hull) without muddle in peak apology beat. Propulsion accelerates via hum to vibrations; clarity pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting via cello/shell resonance transforms riddle trope; risk in lyric hum-method heightens personal stakes. Inevitable hindsight: compass back-turn grows from objects, unbound answer bold.</comment>
