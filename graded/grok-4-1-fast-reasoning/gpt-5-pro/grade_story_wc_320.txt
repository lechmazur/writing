<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority and motivation rooted in mentor's legacy and hands-on maintenance; micro-choices like bolting the star fragment reveal values under pressure. Sela adds relational crucible without overwhelming single-POV focus. Minor abstraction in emotional progression ("knot of pride and warning") prevents 9+ despite earned endurance at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to tone/map revelation; closure as Charged Poise in "Pour the beginnings into the endings" reconfigures gorge/city premise with conceptual cost of carrying weight. Orientation anchored early in tower/gorge setup. One tightening via discarding assumptions to aim "between swing and stillness" narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constraints like creaking cables and moon-tugged guy lines shape tuning choices; recurring horn rig charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (wind writes, turbines hum) filtered through interpreter's priorities. No white-room; gorge evolves from swallower to preserver via map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal interpretation for beginnings) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hush cutting static to map/instruction with city-sag cost. Agency in tuning forecloses assumption path. Enters high band but tightening single via pattern break, not Causal linkage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings-in-endings emerges organically from voicemail/birth cry inversions and final water instruction; resonant CR in cave glow reweights without moralizing. Subtext in fantasy practicality avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind writes in loose wire") and rhythmic modulation under perigee pressure; single-POV stable with no leakage. Sela's scribbles distinguish without dialogue overload. Experimental poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hush cut away everything that did not belong"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor paraphrase loops ("discarding assumptions" twice) and "serenely electric" repetition cap below 9; no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc signal-hunting with terrazzo/hush fantasy rig; bold lyric risk heightens stakes via moon/gorge poise. Transformation test passes: irreplaceable in voice/closure image.</comment>
