<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's curiosity and inherited hands-memory drive concrete micro-choices like stepping pin-to-pin, earning bridge-building agency with embodied tension; cartomancer applies relational pressure via directive "confide with your feet." Internal conflict subtle in confusion-as-map but acts simultaneously with patient mapping. Flawless progression without therapy-speak; voice particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pulses/routes builds to RR closure in "the lattice sang... public rhythm," with conceptual cost of patience paid on-page as people arrive via marked arrows. Neighborhood gap tightens via hypothetical layering into "bridge of possible footsteps." Orientation anchored early (loft, post-crash); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft and cork-map pins constrain choices (pin-to-pin stepping, window-opening draws crowd) and charge final humming image; post-crash grit (burned coins, emptied temples) filters through POV bias. Sensory hierarchy vivid (ticking rain, whistling kettles, siren sighs). Spatial choreography coherent; weather evolves to enable payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping patterns/bridging gap) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via "multiplying paths across that silence" into crowd arrival; agency in narrator's measuring tape use and stepping forecloses isolation with patience cost. One decisive deepening coheres pressure; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reverse-engineering connection from residue emerges organically via lattice-weave; final "room kept humming... borrowed our breath" reconfigures private panic to rhythm without moralizing, reweighting chalk-arrows and steam. Subtext in gaps (neighborhood mouth) invites ambiguity; no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mapping metaphors ("rivers braid silt," "needles were compasses") biases noticing; first-person stable, modulates rhythm with intensity (short sentences in stepping). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("We are not hunting profit"); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("multiplying paths") propels accumulatively; rhythm varies (long poetic swells to clipped "tape clicked"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—coherent lattice imagery peaks cleanly. Minor figurative density fits taught lyric pattern without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms cartomancy into cultural reverse-engineering post-crash via pins/tape/cards; fresh synthesis of mystery-mapping feels inevitable in lattice payoff. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative tropes.</comment>
