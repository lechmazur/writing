<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's defiant artist motivation rooted in sister's death compels communal poetry choices, with embodied anger under mischief shown in "innocently mischievous but lit by a stubborn anger." Contradictory impulses act in leading rhymes that weave versions, earning the final confrontation with visible communal cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like certainty-graves drive inevitable communal defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry sessions density-build to chorus refraction at climax, delivering Charged Poise/CR closure as spire "shivered in its fog, every torchlight fracturing." Orientation anchored early (canyon, spire, I/artist by para 2); no debt. Persistent constraint of echoes shapes tactics to final image reconfiguration with conceptual cost to single-story rule.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (echoes rubbing towers, paint bleeding ribs) filtered through artist's priorities constrain choices: canyon echoes enable refraction, towers anchor communal hollow. Environment charges closure as "canyon waited, a forged hush holding the breath we all had borrowed." Recurrent bone/echoes evolve causally, mirroring defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract single truth vs. spire's story) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via nightly sessions tightening to elders' arrival and chorus overload. Protagonist agency in reciting/misreciting forces trade-off, with cost legible in elders' fear and spire shiver. One decisive deepening coheres pressure without resolution by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as collective shard-holding emerges organically from sister's penance to final speech: "Forgiveness... is the work we do together to hold the shards." Final image reweights single-truth premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity via fractured light. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with perceptual signature (prisms of breath/bone) stable in first-person, modulating rhythm under pressure (short raw-throat lines to braided chorus). No head-hopping; compression taught via echoes legible at closure. Internal idiom particular to artist, no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (refract/prism/shard taught early, coherent to closure); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion via image-charged sentences. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors but no muddle or loops touching peak; no scaffold, filter stacks, or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic defiance in bone-canyon via echo-refraction transforms ritual trope; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes to spire-shiver without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on forgiveness as impossible single-price feels inevitable from established echoes.</comment>
