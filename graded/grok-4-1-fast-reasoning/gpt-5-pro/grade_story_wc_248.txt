<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's analytical intuition drives clue-solving with embodied doubt ("My heart wrenched" at Mira's cipher), earning reunion; contradictory faith-lack yields earned bridge in final partnership without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mosaic shards of trail accumulate texturally to RR closure in Ember Lending reweighting fire's cost; tapestry-doorway match provides causal spine holding lens through legible transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Archive's "dust mote constellations" and "ribcage arch" constrain entry and charge portrait chamber; salt flats evolve to mirror internal disintegration/resolution in final burned-block return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of promise-rescue tightens accumulatively via art-clue deepening ("coordinates in foam"), forcing trade-off interpretation with guilt-cost legible in "keep the blaze outside."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Defacement-as-protection theme emerges organically from slashed portraits and breath-reels, resonating in Ember Lending's "books rewritten as testimony" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Poetic voice ("smoke graphs its own arguments") biases perception analytically/artistically, stable in first-person with Mira's dialogue subtextually affirming ("you listen to what they try to say").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("dawn rummaged through the bones"); metaphors cohere in fire/art pattern without muddle or loops, even in peak chamber beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson-as-salvage and breath-archive reconfigures library trope via art-trail; risk in volcanic lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
