<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene ("choose a branch and thereby choose a past" vs. "make no choice except attention"), earning the final cameo repurposing with embodied cost (brightened disquiet persists but gentler). Interiority concrete and particular, no epiphanies unearned. Flaws (bewilderment) drive mistakes like initial face-impression plan.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via realizations (memory vision, third road), culminating in CR closure ("ledger pages loosened") with conceptual cost (inheritance reconfigured, no cancellation). Orientation anchored early ("astral orchard...lonely asteroid"). One tightening via bathroom insight suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Astral orchard and bathroom micro-setting constrain choices (bare hands rule, pump noise for secrets) and charge final image (seed in mirror frame). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (aurora leaves, resin-laced book). No white-room; lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nonlinear inheritance risk to self) signaled early, tightens via agency (repurposed cameo forecloses face-impression path). Cost legible in peak ("our choices no longer canceled...gentler grammar"). Lens escalation: cadence shift reweights with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: nonlinear inheritance as self-paying debts, resonant CR answer in cameo breath offering "third road" reweighting prior memory without moral. Particulars (ledger carving, seeds as commas) drive complexity. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (synesthetic: "petals edited the air"); rhythmic control modulates pressure (short realizations in bathroom). Stable first-person, no leakage; whispers natural/subtextual. Voice reflects mind under disquiet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax; no loops/artifacts (figuratives consistent, e.g., "falling pollen"). Rhythm breathes with scene (slow breathing inventory to warmed shell). Zero scaffold in closure beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pistachio cameo + astral orchard transforms inheritance trope into tangible map of "pollination and patience." Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight (bathroom returns pay off disquiet). No derivatives.</comment>
