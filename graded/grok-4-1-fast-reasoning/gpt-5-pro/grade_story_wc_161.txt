<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses (obligation vs. mercy in weighing hearts) act simultaneously during Ezra's arrival, earning the choice to send Thimble despite Mara's ghost; internal flaw of shattered trust complicates but drives closure endurance. Embodied emotion peaks in "trust cracked like shell," particular to voice. Final ledger entry shows earned renunciation of isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of attic images and backstory shards builds to Charged Poise closure in Thimble's return and ledger, reweighting trust premise with legible cost ("across learning to trust again"). Orientation anchored early in attic/shop. Single-shard reflective structure fits defaults, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting (cedar drawers, dust motes, skylight) constrains bird training and charges final image, mirroring internal swirl; meteorite anchors scale choice tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (feathers, paste smells). Details evolve with rain, guiding delivery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmarked delivery to rebuild trust vs. tracked trails) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Ezra/Mara echo forcing micro-choice to send; cost felt in risked vulnerability at "the crack inside me brightened." Agency in capsule prep narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echoes vs. snares emerges organically from delivery arc; final dust-mote ledger image offers non-literal answer to trust reinvention, reweighting paper trails without moralizing. Subtext in Ezra's grip layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (dust eddies as navigation score) biases noticing; lyrical syntax/rhythm modulates with pressure (shortened release lines at flight). Stable first-person, no head-hopping; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("practiced fear").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/openings; metaphors cohere (e.g., "dark seed thrown into sky") without muddle in delivery peak. Minor figurative density in reflections but pattern-taught early, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pigeon meteorite/dust navigation synthesizes fresh premise organically; risk in lyric compression heightens echo-preservation stakes, transforming tropes (messages as songs) with hindsight inevitability in ledger close.</comment>
