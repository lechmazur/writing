<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's spatially imaginative trait drives concrete micro-choices like cradling the film strip "the way a bird might incubate an egg," revealing motivation; manager applies secondary pressure through trembling observation but remains passive without crucible shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from psychometry frames to "clear head of the reel" discovery; closure as Charged Poise in threading blank leader to "glow like mercy," with cost legible in unchained hum and warming envelope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Projection booth anchors vividly—"projector purrs like hushed thunder," carpet "heat and ghosted popcorn"—constrains via rewinder/scissors for harvest; recurring dust "like snowfall holding its breath" charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to locate unused love tightens texturally from emulsion clues to splice/leader gutters; agency in harvesting forecloses ignorance with felt cost of "patient and warm" incubation risking barehanded handling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unused love in edited film parts emerges implicitly from goodbye letter images; final "edits their life with gentler hands" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of waiting emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with spatial perceptual signature—"topography made of sprocket holes"—modulates rhythm under pressure; sparse dialogue natural, manager's "people leave goodbye letters" carries subtext advancing revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in "frames unpack like envelopes," varied rhythm propels; minor figurative pile during reading ("stairwells of kisses") risks coherence without obscuring closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Film psychometry for stored love transforms trope into fresh spatial mapmaking; "transparent seconds that theaters cut" inflects ingenuity, risking poetic abstraction but heightening stakes organically.</comment>
