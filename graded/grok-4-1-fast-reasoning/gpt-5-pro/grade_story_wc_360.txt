<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Operator's borrowing trait drives costs like "scratch on him, as if metal had kissed through to bone," earning final exchange; narrator's embodied lacks ("emptiness where it had been like a column beaded by the rain") show contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via star intervals tightening to "held breath," yielding Charged Poise closure in final print where "senses sheared" reconfigures empathy with legible relational cost; orientation anchored early in workshop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Halo fragment as micro-setting constrains (grounds narrator's palm) and charges closure ("left...as if it were a hinge"); workshop/press details tactile and purposeful, mirroring emotional strain without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of emotion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as "vanishings quickened," forcing final print's agency; cost felt in "scratches" and exchanged traits, but minor abstractness slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared emotion calculable emerges via printing particulars, answered non-literally in "curve...jittered at every pronoun" and theorem line; final proof constellation reweights borrowings without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (printing/math filters like "phrases that bent sympathy into coordinate axes") stable in single-POV "we"; purposeful compression taught early, modulates rhythmically to closure intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but heavy figurative layering ("lever came down with a breath like an equation") borders coherence strain in peak beats; no loops, strong propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress-empathy math transforms tropes; risk in "transposed empathy" premise inevitable via star-timed proofs, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
