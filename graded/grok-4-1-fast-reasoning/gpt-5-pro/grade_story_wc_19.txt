<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in tasting bunker note despite rib-fencing panic; final realization thanks father with earned reconfiguration of fear as shelter, foreclosing old cage view with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through pours to CR closure at "I realize the gilded hush was not only the sky’s gift, but the shine my father hid beneath his fear," reweighting premise with felt cost of misread trauma.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trellis and doll constrain choices (hook ankles, limit sips) and charge final descent image as widening rib cage; sensory tastes (coins in sunrise, rope) filter through claustral bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to alchemize bunker trauma escalates texturally from limited sips to full alloying, agency in exposure risk foreclosing panic path with legible lift in "I taste the bunker and I do not break."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence mapping identity emerges organically from pours to resonant CR repricing father's hush; final "cook with them when storms arrive" reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tasting silences ("warm metal softened by mercy"); stable first-person lyric compression taught early, rhythmic control peaks in closure alloying.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, coherent metaphors ("walls sprinting inward"); propulsion varies rhythm to charge closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-tasting in inverted-gravity fantasy; risk-taking in lyric pours transforms claustrophobia trope, inevitable in hindsight at father's shine realization.</comment>
