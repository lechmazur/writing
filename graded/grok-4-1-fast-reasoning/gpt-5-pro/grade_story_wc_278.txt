<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guilt-frost vs. craft-forgiveness) act in tattooing the nephew's name, earning closure change with embodied cost ("absence of a weight"). Interiority concrete and particular via sound-parsing gift tied to flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via letter-steps to CR closure ("letters align... my initials looped through his"), cost legible in self-forgiveness earned across fold ("hand float, noticing absence"). Orientation poetic but anchored early, disorientation pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber constrains rhythm/translation and charges final image ("amber cools against my palm"); credenza supplies letters methodically integrated into action. Sensory hierarchy sound-biased, selective for tattooist POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (hush guilt) deepens via agency-driven escalation: console cry rises ("shakes the lights"), forces name-tattoo trade-off, cost unmistakable in "weight" absence after confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("initials looped... tether of ink") non-literally answers self-forgiveness theme, reweighting prior cries/letters without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sound as "thistle hiss," "chiming") with rhythmic control modulates pressure; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure; stable first-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("The waveform softens, then twists back"); zero loops/artifacts, figs coherent (sound-haunt consistent), varied rhythm in peak cry beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattoo-repair, time-fold letters from self transforms guilt trope; risk in lyric density inevitable in hindsight ("understand... way a tide understands the moon").</comment>
