<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between professional duty and telepathic urging act vividly in the coffee-stain decision, earning the final playing with embodied cost ("The decision hurts, yes, but the hurt is mulberry ache"). Interiority particular via plant voices and stain maps; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to Resonant Reconfiguration: violin melts into river, reweighting promise with conceptual cost to empire. Orientation anchors in first paragraph; single scene tightens via plant whispers to on-page act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (night jasmine's "bruised scent," violin's "cold as confession") filters through POV bias, constraining choice as plants "braid sound into rootwork." Violin as micro-setting charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticate vs return winter promise) signaled early, escalates via coffee perforations narrowing to play under Accumulative lens; agency in lifting violin forecloses empire path with legible cost (melted instrument, departure).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of stolen promises emerges implicitly through mountain pledge vs empire glass; final donors "drink the river and wonder why it tastes like truth" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting theft as heritage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in plant telepathy and stain cartography sustains lyrical first-person stability; rhythmic modulation peaks in playing sequence ("first note is winter glare"), no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative layering borders overwriting in backstory block ("dripping ficus told me its memories"); climax image ("room rains") clear and charged despite pattern density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ice-crystal violin and plant-propogated truth synthesize fresh provenance revolt; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in donors' tainted champagne, transforming theft trope inevitably.</comment>
