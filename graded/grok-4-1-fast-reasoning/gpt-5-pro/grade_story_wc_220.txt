<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation rooted in brother's leaf and distance translates into embodied micro-choices like playing the cylinder and turning the spindle, earning the final closeness via water. Gable's actions reveal character through warm support without dialogue. Contradictory impulses in doubt yield to listening's cost in the riddle resolutions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of riddles and revelations builds to RR closure in the shared water image, with felt cost of prior isolation reconfigured. One tightening via leaf-tinted map narrows path to spindle. Orientation anchored early in scrapyard; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Scrapyard constrains choices (western heap yields spindle, iron hides river) and charges final image (cranes raise arms, settlement inhales). Sensory hush and rust filter through POV urgency. Micro-setting like phonograph integrates into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating distance escalates via riddle deepenings under textural lens, forcing agency in leaf-use and spindle-turn with visible cost of dust-thirst foreclosed by water. Final listening crystallizes stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of closeness via listening/memory emerges organically from cylinder riddles and leaf-light, reweighting distance in final "two hearts agreeing" without moralizing. Subtext in Gable's warmth layers emotional resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice ("wax keeps light like a thought inside a thought") biases perception to weather-metaphors, stable in first-person with rhythmic modulation under pressure. Trader's brief speech natural; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphor patterns (hush recurs to cadence shift); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion peaks in riddle reveals without loops or overwriting harming closure. Minor hush-repetition taught early as tone anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Phonograph riddles with leaf-filter transform post-apoc tropes into lyric ingenuity, risking poetic density that heightens stakes in memory's fragility. Final water synthesis feels inevitable from groove-texts.</comment>
