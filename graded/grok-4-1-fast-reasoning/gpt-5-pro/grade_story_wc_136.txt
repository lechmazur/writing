<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like the "old itch of unraveling mysteries burn under my ribs," compelling the shift from charting others to mapping personal silence with felt cost in offerings. Contradictory impulses act in scene via hesitant micro-choices under pressure, earning the final realization. Quick test passed: final renunciation of external mapping earned by causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds via patterned imagery (cracks, punch, offerings) to Conceptual Repricing closure—"Truths are not prisoners, but travelers"—with undeniable conceptual cost in foreclosed silence. Orientation anchored early in city streets; single surreal shard coherent. Cost legible in "no triumph, only the trembling certainty."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices vividly: pavement cracks dictate route, railyard gaps form door activated by punch, vault's tracks and fires mirror internal nerves. Micro-setting punch and chalk charge final image. Sensory selection (humming lights, mist ribbon) purposeful, POV-biased toward geometries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to enter fortress tightens accumulatively via deepening offerings ("night my father choked," own half-maps), narrowing options to personal truths with agency in punch presses. Escalation driven by protagonist's endurance, cost visible in rang mechanism's "clocklike mercy." Final passengers' release reweights stake undeniably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths as mappable paths emerges organically from particulars like inkless pages and stamped ticket, culminating in resonant CR: "fortress kept nothing... travelers waiting." No moralizing; ambiguity in "charged poise" of platform lingers with conceptual cost. Quick test: final image reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "geometry of feelings laid onto street grids" biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, prose-as-character reflects mapper's analytical artistry. Stable single first-person, no leakage; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. Quick test passed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies beautifully on read-aloud, high density with multi-job lines like "pencil traced their angles, sketching a route like a breathing equation." Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (e.g., mist "curling like a signature") risks muddle but pattern-taught pays off; "trembling certainty" motif purposeful, no loops dulling closure. Quick test near-pass, hairline slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of urban mapping, phantom trains, and truth-fortress transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable punch/paths. Bold premise commits fully, inevitable hindsight in passengers rejoining selves. Quick test: non-obvious inevitability + risk elevates.</comment>
