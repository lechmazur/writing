<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "release, not store; scatter, not save" against his "catalogues were towers," compelling the release with embodied reeling and visible cost of emptying drawers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via monument to CR closure in seed release, cost legible in "reeled, because his catalogues were towers" reconfiguring order premise; orientation anchored immediately, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor bark constrains monument-building choices; Moonstone as micro-setting tool charges final flash and thumb crease image, sensory hierarchy (tasted ash-candy air) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonstone tightening reweights stake from storage to release under Accumulative lens, narrowing via "missing curve" prod with agency in adjustment; cost felt in reeling before emptying drawers forecloses prior path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final "order was a question and listening the only honorable answer" offers resonant CR to listening/release theme, reweighting monuments via crumbling and seed comets without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in leaf-to-monument reading; rhythmic control modulates hush deepening to release chime, diction textured (e.g., "blur stutters into constellations").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery, but minor figurative density ("frostbitten firefly," "soft comets") borders overwriting in peak monument prod without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor premise synthesizes folklore into fresh leaf-grammar release arc; risk in lyric Accumulative structure inevitable via Moonstone pivot heightening transformation stakes.</comment>
