<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory fear (numbers vs. teeth) drive micro-choices like pocketing the shard; final endurance of the corridor breathing earns change with felt cost in honoring the "rhythm I measured." Minor epiphanic abstraction in "weatherproof wisdom" slightly detaches from prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from static-clear to ink patterns revealing the corridor; closure lands as Charged Poise RR in "step into the corridor traced by the shard and the ink," reconfiguring panic into "distant weather" with conceptual cost of confrontation below.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Opal observatory under snow vividly constrains via dome shifts and icicle tremors, mirroring internal hush; recurring porcelain shard charges final image as compass for descent, with ink's "fleeting rivers" evolving causally to map the corridor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fetch wisdom tightens accumulatively through ink-deepening revelation of missed corridor; protagonist agency in kneeling and touching shard forces trade-off, with unmistakable cost in "put the shard on the desk" to face "those who wrote my ending."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from misnamed failure emerges organically via ink maps and heartbeat rhythm vs. paper death; final image resonant reconfiguration answers without moral, reweighting premise through "wiser ending that begins again" amid ambiguity of ghost's apology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in heartbeat-counting and frost-throat biases filters all; rhythmic poetic compression modulates with pressure (short breaths in ink-reading), stable first-person with purposeful lyric elision paying off in closure hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful image accumulation propels via varied syntax; minor figurative density in peak ink beat ("storm maps vanishing") coheres without muddle, though slight synonym churn in "count" motifs nudges below flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic death error, digital ghost, and ink-sky corridor transforms survival trope; bold lyric risk in pattern-taught heartbeat/ink motifs heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via shard's fracture diagram.</comment>
