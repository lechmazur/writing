<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("heart clattered like panicked cutlery"); contradictory impulses (kneel to metal yet refuse Keepers) act in scene, earning final recalibration choice with compromise cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns/ realizations tightens to hatching/song as RR (Charged Poise), reconfiguring palace with undeniable compromise cost in "stalactites less like teeth, more like roots."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (palace/chains) constrains choices (steady cradle amid rocking) and charges final image (lowers shoulders, roots); sensory hierarchy (piston sighs, lime dust) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty vs. mechanical laws) signaled early, textural escalation via egg-tapping realizations and Keepers' threat narrows to song's agency; cost legible in hatchling's compromise mirroring prince.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (flawed genesis, beauty's repair via naming fractures) emerges organically from hatching/song; final image ("survival with music") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting mechanical premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (mechanical-organic metaphors like "gears and prayers"); rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short sentences in rocking); stable first-person POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops; figurative pattern taught early (oil harmonies gnaw) coherent without muddle, though dense metaphors verge on overwriting in reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical myth/organic hatchling transforms steampunk tropes; risk-taking in lyric voice/ending Charged Poise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via egg's reprise.</comment>
