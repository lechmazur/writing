<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the pearl dilemma ("If I kept it... If I released it"), compelling the integration choice with felt cost to sea/village balance; embodied actions like "weigh it with both hands and intention" root traits deeply. Interiority particular via lost-sky backstory tilting present work. Minor epiphanic phrasing doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine polishing to discovery ("a pearl of stillness") to Charged Poise closure integrating pearl into shared breath, reweighting stakes with legible cost in foreclosed paths. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening at shiver/echo suffices. Pattern taught early, closure image undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto coils/mist constrain light-language ("glints move like syllables") and charge final "lung of stone soothed"; selective sensory bias (no fire, tidal glow) mirrors POV priorities. Evolves causally to "light rose... flooding the coil."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patient light-sharing) signaled early tightens accumulatively via pearl discovery/dilemma, narrowing to integration agency with village/song cost felt in "choices do not shout; they lean in." Escalation coherent under lens, but stakes occasionally abstract until closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared quiet/reflection emerges via particulars (broken glass to braided hush); final "sky arrives as a kindness given and received" resonantly reweights premise without moral. Recurring hush net charges without shouting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listen sideways, to read sky from water") biases noticing; rhythmic lyric voice modulates patiently, stable first-person with no leakage. Purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "mist coiled thicker, and a soft ringing rose"); varied rhythm passes ear test, but minor paraphrase loops ("polish, and pause, and weigh") and figurative density in peak discovery slightly thicken without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" and sea-glass constellations synthesize fresh angle on reflection/sharing; bold lyric risks heighten stakes via hush-net, inevitable in hindsight without gimmick.</comment>
