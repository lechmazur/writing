<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority shines in embodied micro-choices like palming the laser button under pressure, revealing contradictory hold-vs-release impulses that earn the closure stance shift. Relationships crucible via Ren/Mira kinship forces realignment without safety-hedging. Minor label-speak in "spatially gifted" slightly dilutes particularity, but doesn't touch pivotal Mira reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory patterns (pulses, glows) build to Charged Poise closure where laser pulse reconfigures network with felt cost of abandoned hardening. Orientation anchored early in farm/zone details; single scene causality tight via alert → Mira → consent signal. No slips in inciting pulse or climax reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Biolum caps and humidity membranes constrain choices (e.g., lamps off to read glows, moving through barriers) and charge final steady image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (spatial mapping via light eddies). Micro-setting via laser button anchors body in climax pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intrusion as misalignment) signaled early via alert; tightening at Mira reveal deepens to gradient-tuning under accumulative lens, forcing palms-open agency with tactical cost (old tools fail). Pressure coheres without reversal overload; cost legible in network's patient loops.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges organically via gradient physics motif shifting from intrusion to consent, resonant in final farm steadiness without moralizing. Final image reweights borders-as-hoarding premise non-literally. Complexity lingers in ambiguity of Mira's "wrong" love.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with spatial perceptual signature (e.g., "glances aligned like stars") modulates rhythm under pressure; stable first-person. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Mira's "I thought you would see me"). No head-hopping; elisions pattern-taught via breath/membranes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative overload (e.g., "quiet wildfire under frost," "mycelial network loves a whisper") borders coherence strain in Mira beat, docking from peak. No loops/scaffold; clean syntax supports lyric propulsion to sparrow close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion as fungal memory/gradient physics transforms tropes via lived spatial idiom. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in permeable ethics; inevitable hindsight in laser reprise. Bold non-causal closure via image reconfiguration.</comment>
