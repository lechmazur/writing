<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through painting choices under restraint; contradiction emerges in "not with unbound color, but with tones that held back," compelling final renunciation with visible cost in unfinished spaces.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via seasonal density building to Conceptual Repricing closure; "postcards ran out, though I had not finished" makes cost legible as restraint forecloses completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Etched glass constrains gaze ("angle my gaze through history") and charges images; pavilion as micro-setting reconfigures question at end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding night blooms) tightens accumulatively as postcards deplete, forcing restrained painting; cost visible in "leaving spaces where the wall itself could breathe."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of restraint emerges organically from petal gestures and glass paths; final "love, not a blaze but a tender shadow" resonantly reweights question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable with perceptual signature in light/refraction noticing; rhythm modulates purposefully, as in "the light walked and considered."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyric figures; minor figurative saturation ("petals cupped like hands") borders overwriting but supports taught pattern without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist quest via glass mathematics and night blooms; risky mosaic shards heighten insight without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
