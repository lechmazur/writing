<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to transmute grief rooted in traits like perceptively calm yet trembling devotion compels micro-choices (e.g., handing clothespin to Ole); internal contradiction embodied in calm facade vs. devoted tremble earns final lighter map case; secondary characters (Marta, Ole) apply pressure via contributions that alter installation state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of added photos builds spiral to wing-shaped RR (Charged Poise) with cost in lighter case implying emotional release; orientation anchored early (lavender field, ruins); no lens ambiguity, closure image ("wing that held the town") reconfigures remembrance with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted ruins (rebar, smokestack) and lavender field constrain choices (stringing lines, pinning during storm) and charge final wing image; sensory hierarchy (lavender scent steadies heartbeat, wind's tune) reflects archivist's perceptual bias; environment evolves causally (storm thrum, sun returns).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute pain via installation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through photo density, children's naming sparks, storm pressure; agency in directing linger/pinning forecloses rushed closure with cost (tremble, leaned corridor endures); one decisive deepening (loose photos lift) narrows to collective wing.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges organically from photo dialogues (grandmother's lamp beside factory shift) and final wing reweighting prior fragments without moralizing; subtext in silences (Ole nods after question) and images (mirrors become windows) invites ambiguity with counter-readings like ongoing loops.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person POV stable with perceptual signature (photos "spoke like cousins," spiral as "river/rib cage"); voice modulates rhythm (slow build to "lavender hummed"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Ole's "garlands from sorrow"); patterned elision taught early, paid in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pinned themselves to light" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythmic variety (short punches amid lyric swells) propels without loops; figurative consistency (arcs bending like swallows) coherent, no muddle in peak storm beat; clean mechanics enhance read-aloud ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of factory ruin/lavender healing wing transforms grief tropes via photo arcs as living memory; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes (storm tests installation); non-obvious final reconfiguration ("space we made to linger") feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
