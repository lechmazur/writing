<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's skepticism yields to embodied shift at "frost penned spirals around a place my father once sat," earning final choice with contradictory impulses acting in scene; Mara's grounded mystic traits compel key guidance without stereotypes. Final renunciation of disbelief forecloses skeptical path with felt emotional cost. 9+ test: impulses dramatized, closure choice causal from prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of frost/prism images tightens to RR closure in kitchen keys feeling mutual, reconfiguring object-emotion premise with undeniable emotional cost ("density, like a room after laughter leaves"). Orientation anchored early (quartz arbor, mist, morning). One deepening at prism flare suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor ribs and frosted car window constrain ritual choices and charge final image via refracted auroras quivering; sensory hierarchy (fogged breath, cooling metal tick) reflects POV priorities. Micro-setting (prism, frost ferns) evolves causally, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism. 9+ test: recurring objects constrain and charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove object-emotion absorption) signaled early, deepens texturally at naming father ("prism flared... curve closing"), forcing endurance of vulnerability with felt cost in "small collapse." Agency in micro-choice to speak/listen narrows options under lens; one tightening charges poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-materializing objects emerges organically via frost/prism particulars, reweighted in kitchen keys without moralizing; final image offers resonant CR to premise ("they felt me too"). Subtext in silences/gestures avoids binaries, lingering ambiguity on apologies. 9+ test: non-literal ending reweights material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (hush as silt, frost as frantic ferns) biases noticing toward emotional hush; rhythmic syntax modulates with ritual intensity, stable POV distance. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Tell it what it wants to be called"), advances via implication. 9+ test: signature/rhythm under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-job (e.g., "lace unfurled across the glass like frantic ferns" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Heavy figurative density risks overwrite but pattern-taught in arbor pays to auroras without muddle or loops in peak (naming beat).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic frost-reading ritual transforms haunting trope via grounded car trunk/history; risk-taking in lyric texture/voice heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Final keys reprise inevitable from prism lattices, no derivative echoes. 9+ test: non-obvious inevitability with risk aiding coherence.</comment>
