<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation from pyramid trauma compels volunteer choice without breathing, embodied in bolt pocket and mud-washed hands; internal conflict between past crushing and new kindness acts in chamber pledge. Minor abstract label ("virtuously mischievous") borders diagnostic without full embodied cost, but final bead endurance forecloses pyramid path with felt price. Strong single-POV coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images/texts builds to CR closure in bead line ("a diamond that remembered every mouth that spoke"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of "gentler geology" from hurt. Orientation anchored early (farm, survivor); single scene seamless, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent aisles, spores like lantern dust, damp canvas constrain choices (mud wash, cap pulse responds to whisper); bolt as micro-setting charges seal and final polish. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (glow wraps like ship), mirrors internal pressure without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pressure to diamonds sans crushing) signaled early, escalates via agency (volunteer, speak promise, hold finger) under Accumulative lens with density tightening to rib-weight condensation; one deepening suffices, cost legible in "ideas cool into weight around my ribs." Band entry met but minor static feel pre-chamber.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pyramid-to-network emerges implicitly via shifting images (tide pressure, circles doors, flakes to clarity); final bead/non-pyramid vow offers resonant CR answer reweighting hurt into structure without moral state. Particulars like texts from bruised selves embrace ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice ("shadowseam wonder," quantum stitches) with perceptual bias (spores drift like memory) modulates rhythm in chamber hush; single POV stable, no head-hop; minimal dialogue natural (foreman rap mouthed).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload in chamber peak ("grammar of pressure...flakes flickered...prismatic like fish scales...grammar rive carbon") borders muddle without full pattern payoff, docking 0.5; no loops, rhythm varies read-aloud. Clear propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mushroom farm, parallel-text selves, chamber alchemy transforms pyramid trope via "gentler geology"; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative lens heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight bead image.</comment>
