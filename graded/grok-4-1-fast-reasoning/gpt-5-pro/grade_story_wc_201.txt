<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied contradictions shine in trauma responses like "wrists try to twist apart" and micro-choices such as loosely looping the strap, earning the renunciation; minor diagnostic phrasing ("proprioceptively enhanced nerves report in lengths and angles") doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building through sensory triggers to CR closure in wrapping the strap as "boundary condition," reweighting return/recursion with legible conceptual cost of relinquishing the past.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Body and strap function as micro-settings constraining choices (testing knees, dripping circle sketches term) and charging the final image; vivid, selective details like "pollen that drinks whatever light... bruised humming" filter through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving mercy's math tightens via trauma-deepening spasms and recursion path to pool realization/renunciation; agency in heel-toe backtrack and leaving strap forecloses trauma-holding with felt cost in "comfort ends and compulsion begins."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as asymptotic limit emerges organically from strap recursion and formula ("intention weighted by injury... power relinquished"), with pool reflection offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting trauma archive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (measuring in "distances between tendons," "shiver write the date on my bones") and rhythmic control modulate intensity; stable first-person lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm support accumulative drive; figurative density in peak pool beat ("pool so still it looks like an equation solved") coherent and pattern-taught, though occasional stem similarity ("I [sensory action]") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive math-seeking in trauma-maze transforms tropes; risk in lyric recursion/renunciation heightens stakes, with strap's "numbers... measuring a corridor of remorse" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
