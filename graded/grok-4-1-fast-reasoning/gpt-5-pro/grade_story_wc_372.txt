<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through concrete micro-choices like revising metadata to coax the third vow's tremor, revealing hierarchy of values with embodied care; motivation intensifies via personal unmeasured vow. Minor slip in abstract "meaning could be coaxed" dilutes peak embodiment, but doesn't touch closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via vow projections to personal oath test, landing Charged Poise RR closure in "ledgers hardened into a shelter" with endurance cost legible in final image of ongoing measurement against "the passing." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via frost-bitten ladders and dome wind affecting slide shivers, charging closure with "quartz hush" and atrium ice test; sensory hierarchy (wool gloves' cedar smell, brass moths) selective and POV-biased. Micro-setting of lantern slide evolves causally with projections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving vows/meaning) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through projection failures/revisions forcing micro-renunciations like "No trace to bind"; agency in decisions narrows options, cost felt in third vow's tremor gnaw and personal endurance. Pivotal tightening at personal vow test charges final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing meaning emerges organically from vow measurements and personal oath, resonant CR in "meaning keeps arriving like weather" reweighting oblivion's edge without moralizing. Final image honors counter-readings (clean blank of survival) via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("ink remembered only shapes," vows as "halos over patient mountain ranges"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to wind-scraped intensity. Single stable first-person POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "slide clicked, the lamps hum-laughed" advances action/atmosphere/sound); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in projections doesn't muddle causality or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frozen archive + vow persistence via frequency sampling transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens endurance stakes, inevitable in hindsight via personal oath reprise.</comment>
