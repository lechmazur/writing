<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through robot-specific embodiment ("composure holds the dust together") and micro-choices like bowing the violin compel the realization with earned contradiction between duty and inquiry; minor abstraction in epiphanies doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via looping density (chalk flecks, dots) tightening to CR closure where violin melt/puddle reconfigures thought-origin with conceptual cost ("city afraid of its own thoughts"); orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice violin and courtyard constrain choices (sweeping, bowing) and charge final puddle image mirroring internal realization; sensory selection (steam cursive, brittle bow) reflects janitor priorities without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought origins) escalates accumulatively through loops to bowing reversal narrowing options (staticky feed) with agency-driven cost (haste cracks violin); pressure coheres to Charged Poise at puddle pause.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of thoughts as "warmth... when contact is careful" emerges organically from violin interaction and sweeping, resonant in puddle comma without statement; reweights loops non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thoughts might be the lint caught between machines") and rhythmic modulation (short declarative loops under pressure) sustain single POV; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (varying lengths evoke loops) and concrete images ("steam writes cursive"); no loops/artifacts dull closure puddle image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robot janitor + ice violin in looped mysticism transforms tropes boldly; bowing dare and puddle reconfiguration feel inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
