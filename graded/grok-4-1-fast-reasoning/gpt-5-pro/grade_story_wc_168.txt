<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scarred firefighter's internal conflict over bargain (roofs vs. nests) drives contradictory impulses shown in embodied doubt ("tasting salt"); earned shift to teaching both via Mira sharing feels motivated with visible future cost. Minor abstraction in epiphanies slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from box opening to shared vow; Charged Poise closure lands on-page as he leaves box under cairn, reconfiguring solo pain into shared grammar with felt cost of ongoing work. Orientation anchored early in climb; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ridge rocks, duff pocket, and porcelain box as micro-setting constrain choices (cones circled "like a listening ear," cone pressed as promise) and charge final cairn image. Sensory selectivity (wind drying sweat, coyote yips) mirrors urgency without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate bargain pain) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Mira's telescope shift and questions forcing plan crystallization; cost legible in vow to plant seeds/teach, foreclosing isolated endurance. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wounds-to-navigation emerges organically from particulars (stars as "old wounds," owls/singing lost); final image of steps matching Mira's offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting bargain without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical single POV stable with perceptual bias (ash/pine taste, smoke pores); dialogue subtextual and distinct (Mira's "sky forgets nothing" pursues witness goal). Rhythm modulates intensity without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (varying lengths build cadence to coyote yips); figurative language coherent in lyric pattern ("hard softness" ties voice). Minor repetition ("gently skilled") avoids loops but caps perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fire scars, star forgiveness, and nest/roof bargain transforms tropes; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hinge vow.</comment>
