<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Librarian's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like "brass ribs, sealed with oil, chafed by barnacles," compelling endurance; baker and boy's micro-interactions reveal values under flux pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from routine to visitor vignettes, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("close the ledger and open the windows") where acceptance reconfigures flux with felt cost of unhurried stasis; orientation anchors immediately, no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains choices (e.g., "smelt the baker's wobbling name with sand, salt, and dusk") and charges final image via evolving floor/ceiling; sensory hierarchy (salt, twine, ripple) filters through librarian's tidal-biased perception, mirroring internal states organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder amid migrating identities) signaled early tightens texturally through visitor deepenings like baker's parcel, forcing endurance choices; cost legible in foreclosed chase ("tomorrow has slipped its leash"), but quiet pressure lacks one sharp agency pivot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder via contradictions emerges implicitly from particulars like creel murmurs and smelting loaf, reweighted in final "old wonder walking home beside it" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in flux acceptance, charging resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tides as voices, gears ticking dust) sustains rhythmic lyricism under "preservation" pressure; dialogue sparse but subtext-rich ("best homes fluctuate"), POV stable/single without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.7<comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm matching scene (slow whale-breath openers to crisp footprints); minor paraphrase loops on "contradictions" (-0.3), but purposeful pattern teaches poetic mode without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh titan-librarian synthesis transforms identity/tide tropes via brass-ribbed endurance; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably in "sea annotate our unhurried breaths," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
