<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in healing others amid own grief act in scene via whispering names and speaking to Mara; final relational shift earned with visible cost in her unclenching jaw and shared radio moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from alignments to breath-guided model to translation; CR closure in "shared burdens lift" reconfigures grief with emotional cost legible in crying over radio and petals loosening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome, lenses, and daylily constrain choices like alignments and press final image; sensory details (copper dawn scent, monitor glow) filter through POV priorities without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding to heal grief escalates accumulatively via breath-listening and grief-weighted algorithm, forcing vulnerability trade-off; cost unmistakable in Mara's answers and narrator's release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from glyph-star matches and final vow without statement; resonant non-literal answer in radio cries reweights isolation premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky's punctured ledger," "breath letters") biases noticing toward rhythms; dialogue subtextual ("stone like drum lullaby") advances under stable first-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives ("dome breathed like sleeping whale") taught early; minor overwriting in "wet stone turning into wheat" slightly dulls peak radio beat but propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of variable stars as grief cipher transforms tropes; risk in poetic voice heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Orla's compass payoff.</comment>
