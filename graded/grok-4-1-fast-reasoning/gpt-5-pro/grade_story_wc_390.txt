<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logic braided with ache) act in the vault demo, earning the palm-on-knuckles restraint and Collector's renunciation with embodied cost (shame at sternum, drowned boy vision). Interiority particular and embodied throughout. Flaw (miswired beacon) compounds to personalize climax without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density tightens from dock chimes to vault hum's release, landing Charged Poise closure ("key cooling to temperature of trust") with legible cost (past visions foreclosing theft). Orientation anchored in first lines; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains choices (skiff approach forces hatch decision, ice pitch sets hum key); vault's "salt sweat and limestone" charges final lock with sensory evolution. POV-filtered details (professional ear to housing) mirror internal states without overt symbols. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly dock-to-vault.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Lens-Heart) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via vault demo risking exposure, forcing vibrational match that crystallizes stances with on-page cost (ribs lifted, grief combed). Agency in tuning breath/hand restraint narrows theft option. Moral calculus (greed vs. clarity) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sonic absolution emerges organically from matching demo to chord's "clarity, which is sometimes the only kindness," reweighting remorse-to-navigation premise without moralizing. Final shuddering gold offers non-literal answer to forgiveness-through-sound. Complexity lingers in greed's temptation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (metaphors like "brass heartbeat," "wet hair") biases toward sonic/sensory; voice modulates rhythmically to hum's thickening. Dialogue subtextual and idiomatic ("not for sale," "cure that sells"). Stable first-person, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sense/action (e.g., "hum thickened, lifting dust...ribs"); rhythm varies read-aloud without loops or scaffolds. Figurative pattern (musical/somatic) coherent, pays off in peak without muddle. Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lens-Heart's remorse-to-navigation crystal synthesizes fresh sonic mythology in drift-ice marina, transforming relic-guard trope via vibrational ethics; risk of demo heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early key to trusting cool-down.</comment>
