<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hands-on folklorist shows contradictory impulses in cautious dive yet touching the ring; final name-correction earned by prior mapping and bargain causality with embodied cost in spine-lacing straightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from drift detection to fragment film to name unwind; RR closure lands on-page in debt payment with legible conceptual cost of corrected mispronunciation relieving the greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and wrecks constrain fin-stroked entry and silt-geometry care, charging final spores-as-snow image; sensory hierarchy (kelp/rust script, apple-anemone sway) mirrors recovery via biased folklorist notice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to recover memories tightens texturally from pollen motes to film viewing to name-speaking agency; one deepening forecloses wrong-name path with felt relief cost in creaking assent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bargain-debt theme emerges organically from kelp-script vows and shadow mismatch, reweighted non-literally in spore-settling reprise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (tidewriting empirics, vowel/consonant fish-snaps) with rhythmic modulation under dive-stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-chains like shadow-never-matching-feet; minor metaphor density in peak ring-step lacks slight propulsion trim but pattern-consistent without loops obscuring unwind.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh folklorist-shadow-debt synthesis in orchard-wreck lyricism risks poetic drift but heightens memory-stake inevitability, transforming fairy-ring trope via name-iron/mint payoff.</comment>
