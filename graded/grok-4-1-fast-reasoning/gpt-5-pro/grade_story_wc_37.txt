<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied ache ("fingers a shuttle of ache") and contradictory fear ("line of fear, as thin and cutting as mica") compelling the climax weave despite shaking hands; final emptying/full reconfiguration earned via prior causality without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from process shards to villagers' song density; orientation anchored early ("alchemical orchard greenhouse"); closure as RR with legible cost in "emptied and full, bound to their recovered days" via final weave image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mica window and fruits constrain choices (peel/listen, slice for laugh-gold) and charge closure ("cracks are threads now"); sensory hierarchy (sap brightening, cold sugar) reflects POV urgency, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) tightens accumulatively via last village's song deepening low notes into spuming threads; agency in singing/weaving forecloses endless night with cost in "hands shake" and emptying ache charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory/release emerges organically from song-nets and weave; resonant CR in "breaking can be a seam for light to return," reweighting prior cracks without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (flickers as pollen, laughs as gold) modulates rhythm under pressure; stable single-POV teaches poetic compression, legible at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short peak bursts like "hands shake, yet the pattern holds"); purposeful metaphors cohere (knit/weave/bind) without muddle, propelling to closure image; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical synthesis (songs as nets for mica-dawns) risks lyric boldness, transforming memory tropes; final "unknots, fibers loosening from bruise to blush" inevitable from prior weave particulars.</comment>
