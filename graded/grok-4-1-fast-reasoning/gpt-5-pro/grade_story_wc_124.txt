<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (tremor, ripple of room) and micro-choices under pressure (keeping vial closed then opening) earn the grief utterance; minor diagnostic label-speak ("mnemonic, precise, and real") in climax slightly undercuts emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("I grieve" utterance reconfigures memory stakes); vial reveal under UV shows felt emotional cost in "door swing behind my cheekbones"; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting (glass ribs, preservation dust, timed dusk) and UV lantern constrain choices and charge final image (glyphs in vial); sensory hierarchy (scent primacy) reflects POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clean grief via smells) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via plant opening and smoke-to-vial deepening that narrows caution; agency in opening vial forecloses restraint with legible cost, though no micro-turn limits to one tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's aromatic weights emerges organically through scent convergence; final image of sealing plant and quiet aisles offers resonant non-literal answer (echo chemistry confronts promise), reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/scent synesthesia) and rhythmic modulation under pressure; dialogue subtextual ("lanterns throw more than light") advances stakes; single POV stable with clean free indirect texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but figurative density peaks slightly overwrought in transformation ("pipes yawning, building needs air") without full sparsity for climax urgency; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lantern broker, extinct scent-plants, and UV memory-reveal transforms grief trope into non-obvious sensory science; risk-taking in poetic conceit heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
