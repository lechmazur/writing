<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses from past lies ("lied to inflate the harvest") act in scene through mended rituals, earning final endurance with the Auditor's rejection by the vines as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of rituals building to Charged Poise closure in vines' doorway fitting the narrator's stoop; cost legible in "light spreads like a rumor that is finally true."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains choices (vines lean toward narrator, reject Auditor's hat) and charges final image; marbles as micro-setting evolve to scatter light, mirroring internal states through tactile placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove garden reciprocity vs. measured luck) signaled early tightens via Auditor confrontation, forcing endurance with on-page cost in maze's selective archway under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of devotion reshaping standardized luck emerges organically from rituals and vines' response; final image ("maze exhales with me") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting measurement premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in plant-bodied metaphors ("grip remains wisely pragmatic, like twine knotted"); first-person stable, rhythmic control heightens ritual pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful simile strings in reflective beats; minor overwriting in metaphor clusters ("light shaped by hands is labor") slightly dulls peak propulsion but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck hacked by cracked marbles and vine reciprocity feels inevitable; risk in garden agency heightens stakes, transforming trope of old gardener wisdom.</comment>
