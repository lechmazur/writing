<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied serene anger as coiled current driving micro-choices like priming the drone and bracing the beam; contradictory impulses (stubborn refusal vs. deliberate focus) act in the relived crisis scene, earning the final renunciation of rewriting the past with visible cost in hairline flares.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from ink lattices to widened second; on-page CR closure in "I place my hand beneath the falling beam and brace" lands with legible cost (splinters as seeds, bones survive with flares), pattern taught early via drone/ink priming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (wind teasing ink into whorls, drone's hum) with ink slab and drone as micro-settings constraining the key choice to enter the threshold; recurring wind motif charges final image of loosened/tightened gusts mirroring collective attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover time-slowing mechanism) signaled early tightens texturally via synchronized breath entering ink gate, forcing endurance/brace with agency; cost unmistakable in "my bones survive with a song of hairline flares," reweighting options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of terror as choir braiding notice emerges organically from ink evaporation and drone mapping, culminating in non-literal CR ("time slows because we braid our noticing") that reweights premise without moralizing; final coals image resonates with serene anger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in wind-carved motifs and selective bias (callused feet remembering grains); rhythmic modulation peaks in slowed-time orchestra, stable first-person with purposeful compression teaching lyric pattern paid off at ink threshold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors (ink as night water evaporating into shapes); figurative density in peak ink-disappear beat borders overwrite but coheres via early pattern-teaching, no loops dulling closure image of beam splinters as seeds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi drone/ink with primal wind-camp yields non-obvious CR on collective attention dilating time; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from sister's fossil lantern to training cue.</comment>
