<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's tactile interiority and contradictory numbness-seeking impulses drive micro-choices like pressing the cassette to the drumhead, earning her chest-pulse reconfiguration with relational cost via Risto's guidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as vibrations densify from minnow-ripples to candle-tremor Charged Poise; closure reconfigures numbness with legible restraint-cost in "a tremor like a candle deciding to be fire again."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern's stalactite-filament and moonlit drumskin constrain tuning choices and charge final image; deaf POV narrows to bone-vibrations, mirroring internal thaw without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake of numbness tightens via backward-songs' patient throbs forcing endurance of hush-restraint; agency in hands-on-drum forecloses scatter into ache with felt pulse-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of space-for-feeling emerges organically from filament-tug and drum-rim kiss, resonant in students' shutters-to-morning without moralizing; final tide-recital reweights hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tactile perceptual signature ("braille river," "skin gleamed as if moonlit") biases noticing; stable close-third modulates rhythm with pressure, eliding sound for vibration-pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense, purposeful figurative weave ("syllables collapsing into inhalations") taught early as lyric hush-pattern propels to closure without loops; varied syntax breathes with throbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf-tactile music, moth-silk hush, and grief-reversal needle transforms numbness trope; risk of pure lyric holds stakes via drum-enthrall, inevitable in hindsight.</question>
