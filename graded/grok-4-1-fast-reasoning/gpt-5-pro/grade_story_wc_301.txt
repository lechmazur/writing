<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—panic held at bay by "daringly methodical" labeling of bench and crack—earning final clearing choice with visible cost of admitting blame in atlas margins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: graffiti pattern break tightens to portal access, landing Charged Poise closure in sealing portal and chalk notes with confession cost legible in "carry the chord until it is not yours alone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Station's cracked mirror, graffiti, and WSP portal constrain choices, charging final image; ivy and nettles selectively mirror internal decay without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness tightens via graffiti deepening knowledge of WSP, forcing agency in clearing with cost of "pattern of blame matched the pattern of water"; minor abstractness in early stake declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of blunt chronicles over fables emerges organically; final accordion sigh offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting rosy past via "chronicles would be as blunt as river stones."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct river-perceptual signature ("culvert breathing," "river coughs") with rhythmic control; stable first-person POV biases details toward water motifs without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but patterned repetition of "bellows patched with tape" borders on loop (three reprises) slightly dulling mid-beats; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chronicler's flood-blame via graffiti-map alignment and busker mirror; risk-taking poetic voice heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
