<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior conflict embodied in pawn-fidgeting and remorse over prince's war; contradictory impulses (cut vs. heal) act simultaneously until climax choice to tie self-thread, earning forgiveness with felt cost of confronting younger self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via progressive knotting (baker's eyelid, child's smile) to pattern break at self-tying ("I tied the knot and felt the tug"), reconfiguring village and self with legible cost in empty hand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth and frayed tapestry constrain choices (each thread to a face) and charge final image (center opens, platinum shines); micro-setting of pawn/body filters through chess-biased POV, selective sensory hush mirrors internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfreeze/forgive) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through knotting reversals narrowing options until self-thread forces trade-off; agency in decoding/knotting drives escalation, cost unmistakable in "handshake across years" and pawn forfeit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mercy emerges organically from chess sacrifices to thread-knots/healing; final image ("ready to teach any child the opening called mercy") reweights premise non-literally, resonant via pawn's surrender without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chess metaphors ("endgames and mirrored boards," "knots would be my pieces"); rhythmic control modulates from taut hush to breathing repose, stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative weave ("snow hung midair like a held breath") but slight overwrites in peak knotting beats dilute propulsion; no loops, clean syntax varies rhythm supporting lyric accumulations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy, frozen-time trope, and thread-tapestry literalizes remorse/forgiveness; bold risk in lyric Accumulative design heightens stakes via irreplaceable self-knot turn, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
