<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to mend the covenant is rooted in past failure and exile-sharpened humility, compelling the final king-tip as earned renunciation; student's minimal but effective pressure via nods and moves reveals relational crucible. Interiority is concrete through embodied actions like thumb on worry stone and breath-matching. Minor abstraction in "hopeful melancholy" as label slightly dilutes embodiment under peak ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of silence, correlations, and chess moves build density to Charged Poise closure in "I tipped my king... covenant unshadowed," reconfiguring the eclipsed pact with felt cost of prior failure and temporary appointment "until morning." Single scene, single POV fits defaults; orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity or disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus parapet vividly anchors with humming railing, aurora, snowmotes, and iron pull constraining chess placements and bird correlations. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV's tutor precision: compasses, needles, rails as tactical tools. Twilight-to-dark evolution mirrors ritual deepening; guard's glance adds outlawed-listening pressure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend eclipsed covenant) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chess-silence translations narrowing to queen's reach and king-tip, forcing trade-off of surrender as libation with visible cost in tipped piece and temporary keepership. Agency in micro-moves like knight to aurora coheres pressure to closure reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening over arguing emerges organically from silence translations and city-outlawed roots, answered non-literally in final rail-song and needle-rise reweighting blunder-city vs field pact. Particulars like pawn-lanterns and bird-diagonals build resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person POV stable with perceptual signature in chess-metaphors and silence-grammar; rhythmic modulation builds from precise arrivals to widened quiet. No dialogue; purposeful compression of elisions (e.g., method nod) taught early pays off legibly at closure. Diction biased toward tutor's precision without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but pervasive figurative density ("velvet throat," "shy bruise") borders overwriting in ritual beats, muddling some propulsion; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "correlating" silence/birds/breaths dull mid-section momentum without pattern payoff. Rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax strong; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chess-as-covenant-mending in outlawed-listening city transforms ritual trope via silence translations and magnetic field rules, risking bold synthesis of game, nature, pact; final libation-tip inevitable from established particulars, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
