<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses peak in altering the sigil, swapping command for question with embodied plant feedback, earning her renunciation of obedience; internal voice particular via chlorophyll tastes and reed songs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as kite decoding accumulates to ritual cycles and amber sigh, yielding CR closure in frond sprout reconfiguring destiny; cost legible in council confrontation and "sleepwalking" refusal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hot springs constrain ritual via heat/cool pulses and mineral water, charging final sprout; reeds as parliament mirror internal evolution, with sensory bias (mineral thirst) filtering through Mara's telepathy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to evolve tradition tightens via moss hiss on rushed cycles, forcing sigil alteration that forecloses obedience path; agency in kernel cupping and council stance yields visible cost in brittle empire warning.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of consent in roots emerges via glyph swap and frond remembering "questions first," reweighting implanted destiny without statement; resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "chords of mineral thirst" and ritual rhythm sustains under pressure; stable limited POV with purposeful compression in plant hums.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in ritual beats ("heat for eight breaths, cool with dripping") propels without loops; minor metaphor stack ("moss hissed, ferns applauded") serves musical payoff without closure muddle.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Telepathic plants decoding kite glyphs synthesize fresh world-logic for destiny trope; sigil angle change risks bold reconfiguration, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
