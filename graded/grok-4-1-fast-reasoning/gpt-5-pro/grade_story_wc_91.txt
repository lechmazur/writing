<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority concretely embodies her trait-driven motivation through micro-choices like unscrewing bug bottles amid volcano mutter, earning her accidental prophecy realization with felt resource cost; no unearned epiphanies or label-speak dilute pivotal rescue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of ashfall, tide pull, and orchestrated arrivals tightens to sea cave rescue; closure RR (Charged Poise in "transformation wore her name lightly") lands on-page with legible humility cost in vanishing footprints; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Obsidian flats and fumarole path constrain skiff route and charge final beach rethreading; sensory hierarchy (hush whispers, ash commas) reflects Mara's textured perception, evolving causally with tide and cough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchestrating rescue via attention/time) deepens texturally when celestial tug unveils cave, forcing bug-lit path amid volcano pulse; agency in ribbon of lights forecloses inaction with resource depletion, cost visible in last coins given.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of accidental alchemy emerges organically from bug lanterns seeding rescue, reweighted in final "orchestrated coincidences vanish like footprints" without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (texture of heat/ash/pulse) biases noticing, stable third-limited POV with rhythmic modulation under stress; minimal dialogue natural ("My mother is up there") advances goal with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via varied openings and purposeful repetition (hush/transformation motifs taught early); high density in rescue beats integrates figuration without muddle, no loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bug-lit tide path and accidental prophecy on volcano beach transforms tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens textural stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "borrowed stars" realization.</comment>
