<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's cultivated estrangement embodies contradictory impulses—intervening via loops while renouncing full entry—earning the final endurance as Charged Poise with personal cost of isolation felt in the polished disc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vignettes build pattern taught early ("wrong number friendships"), tightening to tonight's loop; closure Charged Poise lands in final image ("polish the disc... promise I can keep") with conceptual cost of estrangement reconfigured as fulfillment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring disc constrains choices (wet thumb spins for faltering callers) and charges final image (polishing in absent coat sleeve); tunnel hum/grates filter through POV, mirroring internal distance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching endings via estrangement) deepens texturally from vignettes to orphans' loop, forcing narrator's fade-out agency; cost legible in foreclosed closeness, charging final poise though tightening is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of distance as bridge emerges organically from looped calls; final image reweights premise non-literally—"streetlamps hold their hum like a promise"—embracing ambiguity of estrangement's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (hums leaning closer, wires looping memories) and rhythmic modulation suit lyric mode; purposeful compression/elision taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulation; figurative language purposeful and coherent (glass note "makes the air lean closer"), no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of therapeutic misdials in utility tunnel transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes of estrangement, inevitable in hindsight via disc's reprise.</comment>
