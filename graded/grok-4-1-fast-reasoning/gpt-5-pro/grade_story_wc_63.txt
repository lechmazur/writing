<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the pellet decision for the narrator's own guilt, where town forgiveness clashes with self-denial, earning the final renunciation with embodied cost ("handle warms like a palm"). Interiority is concrete and particular throughout, avoiding epiphanies. Flaws like hidden grief drive inevitable struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure in "the bob feels nearer to the tide's patience," reweighting guilt with conceptual cost of incremental mercy. Orientation anchors immediately ("I climb with oil, cloth"). One tightening via handle-reading suffices, with legible progression to final arc-set.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bob and ridge constrain choices ("stop the weight, coaxing it into the smallest stillness") and charge final image ("ridge gleams... mirror of my duty"). Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency (salt-burned lungs to phosphor letters). Details integrate tactically, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ethical clock-tuning escalates accumulatively via pellet choices narrowing self-forgiveness, forcing trade-off visible in "spare no pellet for my part." Agency drives deepening; cost legibly alters tactics ("replace three shots and remove two"). Moral calculus sharpens peak without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges organically from pellet ritual and handle, reweighting premise in final image of "forgive by inches" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in self-denial. Protagonist arc inextricable from theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tidal metaphors ("hours limp," "sea opens inside") biases noticing toward balance and guilt. Rhythmic control modulates from searing intensity to hushed poise. Stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "heart is... heavy as guilt" advances setting/character/stakes); rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language consistent and pattern-taught in lyric mode, no muddle or loops. Zero scaffold; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock as confessional scale via guilt-shot bob transforms timekeeping trope organically. Rake-handle inscriptions offer non-obvious angle on forgiveness. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
