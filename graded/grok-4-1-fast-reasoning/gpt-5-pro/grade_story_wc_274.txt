<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction shown in "heart argue with my oath like a courtroom under blankets," compelling the fused-name choice with visible cost; embodied tremors and wolves metaphor integrate flaw-driven struggle without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density buildup to charged poise closure in shared tea-sipping silence, reconfiguring obedience with conceptual cost ("name like a fuse"); orientation anchored in opening lines, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Snow-domed library constrains via dormant networks and stacks hiding the shadow, charging final image; selective sensory details (pipes sigh, dust like fish) filter through archivist bias, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (oath vs. provoke conversation) tightens accumulatively via letter-reading micro-choice narrowing to send with personal fuse; cost legible in "feared punishment, yes, but fear was smaller," agency forecloses sealed-away path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of thawed truths vs. obedient silence emerges organically from letter's perfume-spread and final "silence would speak without permission," resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in archivist's poetic diction ("sentences kissed like steel meeting flint") stable in first-person; minimal dialogue ("cup of tea") natural, subtext-heavy; rhythm modulates from quiet to humming organ under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-charged sentences; figurative pattern (snow/thaw/serpent) taught early pays off without muddle, though peak-send density borders overwrit but remains legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cryo-library premise synthesizes frozen preservation tropes into fresh network-perfume scandal; bold lyric risks heighten stakes in subtle thaw-reconfiguration, inevitable in hindsight from "ghost channels."</comment>
