<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "my stomach becomes the canopy" during buckle crisis; motivation to preserve trust drives micro-choices like signal revision. Minor diagnostic slips ("pride is the cheap spice") abstract peak emotion without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening at buckle slip to Charged Poise closure in "buckle endures, a small bright vow"; orientation anchored early in arbor vigil, cost legible in recommitted burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor constrains choices (gusts, bark landing); recurring buckle and lanterns charge final "lantern light pooling" image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust preservation escalates texturally via buckle slip reversal, narrowing options through radio-guided endurance; agency in "air-dance with him" bears felt cost in voided self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust as "small kept promises under pressure" emerges from buckle crisis and record entry; final arbor breathing offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-seeking diction ("currents stitched through the dark"); rhythmic modulation under stress stable, sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("pressure travels up the cables like a heartbeat"); purposeful motifs avoid loops, minor "revise" repetition voice-motivated without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh arbor-above-clouds premise transforms parachute trope through muscle memory and vigil; lyric risk crystallizes in buckle-as-vow image, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
