<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied remorse ("wearing failure like a map") driving micro-choices like softer playing; contradictory pride/remorse acts in flute scene; earned renunciation of old oaths with cost in curved markers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density to Charged Poise closure ("failure no longer hisses; it hums"); cost legible in reconfigured markers and breath kept open; single scene anchors orientation early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood and canyon constrain flute's echo and markers' shift, charging final image; sensory hush/echoes mirror internal states purposefully; micro-setting (flute, shale) evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest failure insights) deepens via visionary braid with agency in remorse-threaded notes; accumulative cadence reweights to new pass; cost felt in foreclosed cave path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared edges emerges organically from flute-weaving and twin self; final image resonant reconfiguration ("teaching edges to share") without moralizing, reweighting failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("mist stitched...pale silk") modulates with intensity; stable single POV; rhythmic syntax reflects patient mind without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful weaving motifs; minor fig-lang density in peak notes beat but pattern-taught; no loops, strong propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic fantasy into lyric failure-harvest; risk-taking poetic voice transforms tropes, with driftwood/flute turns inevitable from particulars.</comment>
