<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and musical, with contradictory impulses like resisting the "old urge to chase" earning the motionless clarity at closure; grandmother reflection anchors without flattening pressure. Flaws like reverent stubbornness complicate appraisal without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via echo/gull density building to pulse's return and CR closure ("the path draws itself... I resist"); orientation anchored by ~50 words, cost legible in endless map ("dust keeps writing"). One tightening: pulse "strides" to boundary then relieves into channel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain stillness-navigation, charging final image of "night spines the world"; sensory hierarchy sound-dominant, POV-biased via "ripples skating across petrified marrow." Micro-setting arrowhead evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax pulse motionless) tightens via drone/shave/speak, narrowing to channel with agency cost of patience; under textural lens, gull braid and stutter force stance crystallization. Forecloses chase path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stillness vs. wandering emerges organically from pulse/traders/particulars, final image ("even forgetting remembers") reweights without moral; ambiguity lingers in unfinished map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in resonant diction ("decays and overlaps sketch out distances"); rhythmic modulation peaks at hum ("shivers the dust"), stable single POV with lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, no loops/artifacts; figurative consistency (musical echoes) purposeful, not muddled, though minor density in mid-beats subtracts slightly from peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic archaeology in bone canyon transforms lyric navigation trope; risk of motionless plot heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pulse's agency.</comment>
