<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's stubborn motive to find unlearned lessons compels higher-stakes trades like petal grammar; contradictory impulse to abandon burden at library entrance acts in scene, earning renunciation with felt tug. Time traveler's unlearned apology forces micro-choice revealing narrator's values. Flaw of carefulness complicates without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from gaps to index descent; closure as Charged Poise in palm-stamped trade reconfigures options with cost (ache, foregone forgetting). Pattern taught early via "unheard symphony" pays off in "lifting of rests." Orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mountain bookstore constrains via gaps-as-doors at inciting rescue and climax; sensory shifts (thyme/chalk, cooling air) reflect urgency and POV bias toward botanical scents. Thread and diary as micro-settings guide choreography and charge final knotting. Details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescue tightens accumulatively at index negotiation narrowing options via breath/synonym trade; traveler's doubts deepen pressure, forcing gap-research agency. Visible costs (thread fray, palm ache) alter tactics and charge final renegotiation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unlearned lessons emerges via traveler's self-apology and narrator's refusal to abandon burden; final sky-apology reweights carefulness motif without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like copied doubts into walls invites ambiguity on refusals' cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in silences/gaps biases noticing; poetic voice modulates rhythmically from hush to lifting rests under pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Palinode's warning). Stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; symphony motif coherent without muddle in peak rescue beat. No loops, scaffolds, or template cadence; rhythm varies for descent urgency, opening/final lines recharge motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Petal-grammar trade and library of refusals synthesize linguistics/botany ingeniously; transforms labyrinth trope via living stacks and gap-research, risking bold voice without gimmick. Fresh angle on time travel via unlearned lessons feels inevitable.</comment>
