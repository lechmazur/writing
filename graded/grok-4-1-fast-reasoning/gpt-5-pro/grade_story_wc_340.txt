<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the diary-reading choice versus duty ("Curiosity is a cousin to service"), earning the final renunciation with embodied cost in "restrained heart"; interiority particular via metaphors like "bell loves the wind."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations densify floor-by-floor toward CR closure ("letters finally settle into sleep" reconfigures grief's weight with conceptual cost of forgetting); orientation anchored in first paragraph, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound spire and elevator constrain timing/choices (cables "sang," sudden stop at seventh floor forces decision); goggles as recurring tool charge final image, sensory details (hoarfrost, breath as "pale thread") mirror internal states through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivery vs. witnessing grief) signaled early, escalates via diary revelations under Accumulative lens (each floor deepens knowledge, narrows detachment); agency in following map/breathing names, cost legible in foreclosed curiosity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of seeking "joy beneath anguish" emerges organically from diary notes and servant's endurance, final image offers resonant CR without moralizing; subtext in "affectionate detachment" reweights service via charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("letters rose like frost ferns"); rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences at stops), consistent first-person lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line advances revelation or texture); minor overwriting in metaphor density during ascent beats ("ink... in constellations") risks slight opacity but pattern-taught and voice-motivated, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of encrypted relic and ascendant service transforms grief trope; risk-taking in floor-marked texture heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via goggles-diary-map chain.</comment>
