<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in rubbing the nail and dampness climbing sleeves; contradictory pull between exile reversal and honoring ancestor compels staying, with micro-choices like cliff trek earning closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as journal decodings filament a sky river then cliff samples; Charged Poise closure in staying one cycle reconfigures options, cost legible in "hold the nail tighter" and reversible bargain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Damp plywood floors and sweating cliff constrain choices like nail use on intake; recurring nail charges final table-pressing image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific (e.g., gulls scissoring air).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping for exile reversal tightens texturally via stanzas-to-samples deepening; agency in decoding/questioning forces trade-off stay, cost felt in Mirek's mud-hardens warning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Overlooked bravery theme emerges organically via hidden vials and nameless death; final dream image reweights home/reversible exile without moralizing, resonant via nail motif shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct poetic signature in "intercom coughs foreground static" and perceptual bias toward navigational poetics; dialogue sparse but subtextual (Mirek's ghost warning), first-person stable under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors like "slender path filaments forward"; minor overwriting in stacked images (e.g., cliff sweat/gulls) doesn't obscure closure but slightly elevates non-peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coffin nail unlocking modern sensors/original thrift-logic synthesis transforms inheritance trope; lyric risk-taking in poetics heightens closure dream without gimmickry.</comment>
