<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya's motivation to recover the unnamed woman's laugh drives micro-choices like reading grounds and exhuming cubes, rooted in embodied loss (pocket's "thin rectangle of absence"). Internal endurance against gravity pockets shows contradiction without tidy resolution. Final arrangement at whale earns change via prior causality, but lacks overt flaw confrontation at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from flame lean to crystal exhumation to whale altar, with closure as Charged Poise in "names fall out like rain... town remember itself." Orientation anchored early (Ilya post-whale harbor). Cost legible in brief laugh return then migration to whale bone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt chamber constrains via tongs and gravity slack wait; crystals as micro-setting charge memory reveal ("words, then a laugh"). Whale ear bone final image recharges tideline motifs. Sensory bias (iron rain air, salt sweat) POV-specific, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via exhumation reversal (clouded cubes to flower laugh), narrowing to whale ringing with agency. Cost felt in pocket tightenings forcing pulse-marked waits. Escalation coherent under lens to closure charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory migration emerges via particulars (salt lattices, whale vestibule); final altar image non-literally answers "where deleted memories go" with conceptual cost of sea's ancient hold. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "trembling altar."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (grounds spirals, flame leans as gravity eddies). Rhythmic diction ("breath paused between heartbeats") modulates pressure; crystal voice indirect, subtextual. No head-hopping, elisions purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short peak sentences like "He kneels, sleeves rolled"); no loops or scaffolds. Figurative pattern (salt/lean/bend) coherent without muddle, though dense in chamber beat slightly risks overwatch (-0.2). Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity pockets + salt-memory crystals + whale bone choir transforms forgetting trope organically. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight; final "lanterns that now burn straight" recharges opening lean uniquely.</comment>
