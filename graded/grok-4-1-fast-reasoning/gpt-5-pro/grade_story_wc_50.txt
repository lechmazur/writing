<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through peripheral focus and vow-driven micro-choices like chalking daisies and harvesting echoes; embodied in cave interactions without therapy-speak. Minor slip: contradictory impulses subtle rather than simultaneous in peak repair beat, but final renunciation earned with cost of humility. Closing vow reveals hierarchy of values tying traits to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via echo patterns building density to CR closure; "mechanism began, its tick like a cave drip made civic" reconfigures time with conceptual cost of stored humility legible on page. Orientation anchored by para 2 ("marble cavern," timer scent). One tightening as depth increases to risky voices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marble cavern as micro-setting constrains timing via echoes and charges final hum of congruence; sensory hierarchy (echoes over visuals) POV-specific, selective (drip intervals stand in for seconds). Evolves with light shifts ("blue thread, then silver, then ash"), mirroring internal harvest without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair via cave tempo) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening (first bruised echo to storm voices) narrowing to risky deeper harvest; agency in angle adjustments and chime-baiting forecloses direct repair path. Cost visible in "wounded season" limp and humility seal charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder hinged to reason emerges via echo-harvest particulars, reweighted in final jar-label ("winter-humility") as non-literal CR without moralizing; subtext in stone's indifference vs. locksmith's vow invites ambiguity on understanding's price. Recurring echoes constrain choices organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (peripheral edges, stone as tutor) with rhythmic modulation (short beats in repair, breathing lines in harvest); POV stable first-person, compression taught early via poetic elision paying off in closure congruence hum. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sacks woven from patience and calibrated silence" advances character/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative consistent and voice-led without muddle in peak (escapement set with phantoms). Minor overwriting in echo metaphors offset by pattern payoff at tick.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith trope with echo-harvest physics redefining time; bold lyric risks (cave as watch) heighten stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via peripheral focus constraining ingenuity. No derivatives; perspective memorable through marble-tutor angle.</comment>
