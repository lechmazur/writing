<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation as ignorance cartographer compels micro-choices like modeling uncertainties into gardens, earning the poised closure; contradictory impulses between certainty and openness act in scene via Council persuasion. Council applies pressure but softens credibly. Minor abstraction in embodied emotion ("pressure hides under smoothness") kept from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from preparation to Council entry and agreement, landing Charged Poise closure in final suspension ("before the pen meets the blank page"); cost legible in foreclosed omniscience path ("cages make reckless wings"). Orientation anchored early (spire, lake, satchel). Lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen lake cracks and spire thrums constrain choices and mirror internal states, charging final image; kingfisher quill as micro-setting enables precision under limits. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (glacial wind, brass orreries). No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balanced prediction to prevail) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via models showing fogs/breaks, forcing Council stance shift to trellis; agency in showing lattice forecloses wall option with felt cost of unchecked certainties. Escalation subtle but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of trellis over wall emerges organically from models/arguments, final image ("future began listening") offers resonant CR reweighting certainty premise without moralizing. Particulars like ignorance rivers drive earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in nature-tied metaphors ("cogs sprouting petals") biases noticing toward boundaries/openings; stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically to charged poise. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Show us how").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors building pattern (lake/quill recurrences propel without muddle); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak ("choice and chance braided like kelp") dings from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope via ignorance cartography and predictive gardens transforms prediction into trellis model; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
