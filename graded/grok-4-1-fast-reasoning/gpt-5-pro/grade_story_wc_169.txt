<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Logical dreamer's interiority shines in concrete micro-choices like decorations as variables and setting the mirror for personal fear, earning the final self-naming as variable with embodied cost. Contradictory impulses (method hiding fear) act in scene, compelling communal shift. No unearned epiphanies; voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns accumulate density to neighbors' exchanges and CR closure in "hope equals attention multiplied by exchange," with cost in trading failures and personal fear via mirror. Orientation anchored early in grotto; one tightening via children's song resolves to gatherings. Final image reconfigures premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's tides erase chalk, constraining proofs; gauge and decorations as micro-settings charge choices and final gleaming image. Sensory hierarchy (salt-crusted maps, updrafts) filters through POV's pattern-seeking bias, evolving with events. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear even with neighbors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed/slumping balloons to rising gauge with song/exchanges, narrowing to personal fear confrontation. Agency in revising patterns forces trade-offs; cost legible in bare hooks and relit balloons. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope as buoyancy/exchange emerges from particulars like shell choirs and gauge rises, culminating in non-literal equation answering initial conjecture without moralizing. Final image reweights decorations from trials to guiding patterns. Subtext in invitations to "try a different vow" invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-obsessed noticing (ribbons along arithmetic curves); rhythmic prose modulates serene intensity. Single POV stable, no head-hopping; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. Voice as character: syntax reflects lucid watchfulness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "needle quivered toward ascent" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors consistent oceanic/buoyant, no muddle in peaks; purposeful overwriting fits taught lyric pattern. Propulsion clear to final chest-tide proof.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of parallel timelines via resonant grotto, decorations as equations, gauge for hope's lift transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; final theorem inevitable from particulars. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
