<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied "luminous ache in my ribs" tied to Lina, driving micro-choices like leaf-loop repair; contradictory holding/leaving impulses act in the governor-seating beat, earning final posture shift with personal cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like longing complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via repair density and image layering, holds to Charged Poise closure in hand-settling and frames-sent image with legible opportunity cost (missed capture/Lina link). Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene fits defaults, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Leaf recording as micro-setting constrains repair choice and charges final hush; lunar rails/bolts "ping like hail" evolve causally with quake, mirroring internal states through tactile POV filter. Sensory hierarchy (hush over visuals) fits urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture comet via repair) signaled para 1, tightens texturally via governor discovery/deepening to quake pressure, forcing endurance with tactic shift (leaf gravity); agency in "breathed once, tapped" forecloses blur-risk path, cost felt in dust ghosts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of naming/holding ephemeral emerges organically from repair particulars, reweighted in final "flicker, and be enough" image without moralizing; subtext layers via Lina/dust parallels, inviting ambiguity on leaving/staying.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listen to machines like stories") biases noticing toward sighs/gears; rhythmic modulation peaks in quake's "thin as thread," stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "leaf on loop and counted microseconds" advances action/character/theme); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (ache/velocity) without muddle in peak repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar repair with Earth-leaf relic transforms time-trope via personal velocity motif; risk in poetic frame heightens stakes (ephemeral capture), inevitable hindsight from governor-drift to "forgiveness...into my quiet."</comment>
