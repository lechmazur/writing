<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "every screw tightened to the quarter-turn my hands had memorized," revealing helix-minded traits under pressure; contradictory caution-audacity conflict dramatized in river sensor memory without tidy resolution. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "synaptic plasticity" borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via dial shifts unlocking memory layers; closure as CR in "vowed to excavate gently... carry artifacts without mistaking them for altars," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of release over fossilization legible in packing dawn image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Broken periscope mirror as micro-setting constrains key choices ("angled wires like vines," "tilted with a click") and charges final image via refracted moons evolving to "dawn arrived like a calm hypothesis"; canyon harmonics selectively mirror internal quaking reverie.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to excavate entangled memories signaled early and deepens texturally through bandwidth widening, forcing confrontation with "hardest layer" of caution vs. audacity; agency in whispered question and vow forecloses fossilizing path with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gentle excavation over grief-fossilization emerges organically from memory layers, culminating in resonant CR where final vow/image non-literally answers "What did we abandon" by reweighting regrets as "relief"; purposeful ambiguity in entangled laughs lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature in helix/coil diction ("unspool logic from trembling filaments") modulates rhythmically with pressure, compressing under theta waves; stable POV with no elision, prose syntax embodying engineer's chaotic precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful helix/braid motifs taught early propel momentum; minor overwrite in peak beats ("braided into entangled memories that refused to separate cleanly") risks muddle but coheres via pattern without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural engineering and dream archaeology transforms grief trope through specific mirror/headset ritual; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "modify the way memory fed light into itself."</comment>
