<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's powerfully gentle trait embodied in patient striking and child interaction compels choices like letting bells answer director; internal consistency drives endurance at closure. Minor epiphanic polish in "forgiveness is not my trade" feels slightly idealized but doesn't touch pivotal setup or success beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from bell-tuning to visitor pilgrimage, tightening via lingering time as measure of connection. Closure as Charged Poise in alcove lens image reconfigures premise with cost of ongoing retuning to avoid hardening; cost legible in "permission" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lens as micro-setting constrains choices (bends light to teach voices) and charges final ember image; lab's sonic specificity (dust confesses, hallway current) filters through POV urgency. Sensory hierarchy poetic yet tactile, no white-room flaws.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover connection texture post-outage) signaled early, tightens texturally via director doubt to visitor success/lingering. Agency in arranging listening forecloses preaching path with patience cost; subtle moral calculus vs. donors but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection via listening emerges from particulars (knock-maps, breath shimmer) without statement; final "slow bell of each other" reweights silence/noise premise non-literally. Lingering ambiguity (no fixed destination) invites reflection with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in prismatic/sonic diction ("harmonics ripple," "coal scars redirect"); stable first-person filters all, voice modulates patiently. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (director's logistics vs. bells' thrumming).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful/patterned (golden shadows recur without muddle), rhythm varies read-aloud. No loops/artifacts; final "douse the lights" line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic lab pilgrimage with coal-lens optics transforms blackout tropes via lived patience; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "permission" closure.</comment>
