<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in cursed obedience to tapping versus stubborn grief-driven descent; wedging into the seam earns final reciprocal addressing with embodied cost of breath-brine sharing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: lens hum accumulates to descent coordinates and repair; conceptual repricing closure in mended lens reconfigures signals into rest with undeniable cost of self-occupation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Underwater library's silted stacks and drawers constrain inventory choice, charging final image where lens "remembers how to hold light"; POV-filtered details like "plankton make a slow alphabet" evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to rest signals tightens texturally from ricochet shame to blade-thin seam intervention; agency in pressing until "messages no longer ricochet" pays felt cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reciprocal stamping reweights wandering voices into fixed addresses without moralizing; theme emerges organically from lens prism scattering mercy to blooming spines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature—"tapping on my teeth"—modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable distance biases toward burial idioms without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in descent; purposeful metaphors like "drawer in the dark" cohere without muddle, sharpening closure's "softer eye."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater library of drowned Morse transforms undertaker trope into grief-inventory synthesis; risk of surreal occupation heightens stakes inevitably from package seed.</comment>
