<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like pocketing the sextant and tuning valves revealing a hierarchy of practical hope over despair; motivation intensifies credibly through engineering under limits. Minor slips in reflective labels like "functionally creative" feel told until dramatized in sketches, but do not touch closure endurance. Final planning tomorrow earns from prior causality with calculated restraint as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery to fountain surge, tightening to sustainable lights calculation; Charged Poise closure reconfigures the terminal with legible opportunity cost in "calculating how many lights she can afford." Orientation anchors immediately in spaceport after carnival. No causality breaks; persistent constraints like corroded valves shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "cistern...full of rainwater and confetti stars" and solar panels constrain resurrection choices, evolving causally with action; recurring fountain as cosmic mouth charges final whispering image. Sensory hierarchy (bone cold metals, lemon-tar tape) filters through Mara's engineer bias. Micro-object (sextant) aims light, mirroring internal redirection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild hope via flows) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via density in rerouting/ tuning, culminating in surge then limit-calculation trade-off; agency in her patient micro-choices forecloses excess spectacle. Visible cost in "tuning resistance...patient as tidelines" and light affordability charges poise. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope as engineered redirection emerges organically from particulars like valves/arrows mirroring social paths, without statement; final image of glowing terminal and communal invite reweights "maze of intentions" non-literally. Complexity in refusing despair via math-prayer lingers with ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in engineering diction ("load paths and social paths"); lyric compression taught early via metaphors, legible at closure. Boy's dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing communal vector. Rhythm modulates with pressure, prose as mind under stoic stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "math is a prayer that knows valves" advance multiple layers; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density consistent in poetic engineering pattern, no muddle at peak surge. Clean mechanics, specificity over generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi decay into intimate engineering lyricism transforms tropes; risk in accumulative poise heightens stakes via confetti-water hybrid image. Non-obvious angle on hope as amperage/gradient inevitable from particulars. Bold voice commits fully without retreat.</comment>
