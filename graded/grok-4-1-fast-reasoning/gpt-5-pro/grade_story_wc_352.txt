<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism-minded archivist's motivation rooted in hunger and mentor's seeds compels micro-choices like drumming the panel's grooves; embodied contradiction in smoldering blaze vs. tightening nerve peaks at token grasp. Final endurance to return forecloses complacency with felt ache. Voice-specific traits avoid stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of thresholds and luminous cues builds to chamber's tokens; CR closure in "walking home shimmering with quiet bells" reweights vigilance premise with ongoing hunger cost. Orientation anchored early ("edge of fog," inversion hush). No ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (sidelong spores, rustling numbers) filters via archivist's bias, constraining choices like pausing "between wet and dry stone." Grotto's coils and upturned stalactites charge final ripple and jolt. Micro-objects (folio, tokens) evolve tactilely, mirroring internal blaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (combinations) signaled early tightens accumulatively: threshold hums narrow path to panel rhythm, time hollowing forces partial glean with inversion's end as felt cost. Agency in listening and parting curtain drives escalation. No abstract stakes; visceral in boots-to-ceiling walk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vigilance theme emerges organically from seeds/tokens motif shifting to catalog-planting; final image reconfigures forgetting's repository with non-literal resonance of "quiet bells" against ache. Ambiguity in endless returns embraces complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-minded," sidelong glances) biases noticing; rhythmic syntax modulates from tightening nerve to shimmering close. Stable first-person distance; purposeful compression legible under textural lens, no withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: motifs recur purposefully without loops, rhythm varies (short inversion hush vs. rippling exit). Zero scaffolds; metaphors cohere (grotto throat, smoke lake) without muddle in peak token reach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inversion physics, luminous margins, and tonal tokens transforms vigilance trope; risk in upturned chamber heightens stakes organically. Final "planting vigilance" feels inevitable from early seeds, no derivative hedging.</comment>
