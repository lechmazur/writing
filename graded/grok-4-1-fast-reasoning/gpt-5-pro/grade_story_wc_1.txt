<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and adaptive motivation shine in "steadily adaptive hands learned new timings," compelling the kiln revival with earned reclamation cost; minor epiphanic abstraction in mentor recall slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density tightening from ledger to frost to kiln revelation; closure as Charged Poise in final breathing reconfigures loss into spacious purpose with legible conceptual cost in "life can set without cracking."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon frost and buried kiln constrain choices (veins point to bend, bolt matches ledger), charging final starry kilns image; selective sensory weave mirrors glasswork priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover pauses' purpose escalates via frost-guided discovery and kiln firing agency, narrowing to creation with felt cost of reclaimed risk; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of heat-written memory emerges organically from particulars like ash spiral and glass breaths, resonant non-literal answer in "pauses I had reclaimed" reweighting fire's warning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (glass metaphors, breath/inhale rhythms) modulates with intensity, stable first-person bias taught early; purposeful compression legible in closure exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration, no loops; minor figurative density in peak kiln warming ("exhaled and those pauses became shapes") purposeful but edges overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh glass-smuggler synthesis via scorched routes transforms artist-survival trope, inevitable hindsight in ledger-kilin alignment; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
