<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses (profit from gossip vs. ritual apology) act in shaking hands and spoken regret; earned reconnection via Mara's scar-map as crucible. Voices distinct in sparse dialogue: her pragmatic "try telling yourself that" vs. his metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens densifies to Charged Poise closure in hymn recording and hand touch; cost legible in "we did not forgive everything, but we did reconnect in the small." Orientation anchored early in archive hush; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perfume bottle as micro-setting constrains ritual (salted water Leyden jar) and charges final image ("hairline singing with charge"); sensory hierarchy (scent uncoils jasmine/diesel/apples) reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ritual tightening (current catches bottle, voice emerges) driven by agency narrows to apology under dominant stake of reconnection; cost in bottle crack and imperfect hymn unmistakable at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hymn titled "Ladders for a Thiefed Wind" offers resonant non-literal answer to redemption via modulation; theme emerges organically from column harm to music's endurance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("paper rind protecting paper flesh") and rhythmic control modulate with ritual intensity; sparse dialogue subtextual ("try telling yourself that when you sleep").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to climax; dense figuration ("shelves knocked out a slow backbeat") coherent in voice but borders overwrite in peak beat without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Leyden jar exorcism from radio copper and gossip exorcist premise synthesize occult/music orchard loss in fresh, inevitable way; risks lyrical density payoff in charged hymn.</comment>
