<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's trait of hearing unspoken words drives patient rebellion, embodied in "cradle them until they settle"; contradictory impulses between forceful march and chess-like subtlety act in planning vs. execution; final endurance earned with cost of waiting, no safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from plan in grotto hush to windows waking, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "second thoughts spread like fungi"; orientation anchored early in library; cost legible in council hesitation and ongoing cradling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto as micro-setting constrains plan origin/return and charges final clocks image; mist/library specifics filter through POV urgency, mirroring internal quiet; sensory hierarchy (twitch/rattle, thin tone) selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (library/town vs. bulldozers) signaled early, tightens via window execution hearing mayor/shopkeeper thoughts shift; agency in synchronized displays forecloses hasty moves with patient cost; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pause/second thoughts emerges from zugzwang boards/magnets, resonant CR in "forests of second thoughts" spreading without moralizing; final grotto image reweights premise via conceptual cost of unseen pulls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in hearing unspoken (e.g., "groan of worry, metallic clink"); rhythmic prose modulates with hush intensity; stable first-person POV with no leakage, diction biased to chess/crading idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "pinned blue threads... cross like gambits"); purposeful metaphors consistent (magnets tugging as unseen pulls); no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies for propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zugzwang windows as humble rebellion synthesizes chess/hearing trait/original grotto into fresh frame; risk of quiet non-confrontation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "pause, then consider" caption payoff.</comment>
