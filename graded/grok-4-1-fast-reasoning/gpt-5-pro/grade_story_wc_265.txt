<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stray philosopher's contradictory impulses—vowing straight quest yet yielding to spirals—embody patience as "bearing ungreased"; gear-measured answers and tongue-chewing earn final reconfiguration with self-fence cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via sound-density build from fern cogs to tower chord; orientation anchors early in rainforest post-sense awakening; CR closure lands in mirror gear-tooth realization with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest constrains via sound-currents as "corridors" and spiral paths; metal trees' winds (tinny sighs, throaty warnings) filter through insight bias, charging spire's coinlight and piston ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to rediscover mind tightens accumulatively through failed bindings and figure tests to whistle-agency at tower; patience cost as "unreliable bearing" forecloses linear approach, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-fenced wildness emerges implicitly via gear's shift from sunrise-seed to gate-tooth; mirror revelation offers resonant CR repricing of vows without moral, reweighting sound-method over vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sonic perceptual signature biases noticing (tin sighs to harmonic ropes); rhythmic braids modulate dawn-grove to thunder-syntax without slippage; translocative elisions taught early pay off legibly in spire lift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels with zero loops or scaffolds; coherent metaphor vehicles (vine cables, turbine bones) avoid muddle; minor hum-motif density risks peak opacity but pattern-taught integrates fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Steampunk-lyric fusion of sonic cartography and mind-frontier yields inevitable hindsight punch; bold tower-whistle risks heighten stakes, transforming probable miracles into rain-dialect without gimmick.</comment>
