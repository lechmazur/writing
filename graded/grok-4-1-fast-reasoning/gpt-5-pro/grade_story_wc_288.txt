<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "Shame tried to drown me, but Tone: None kept me afloat," forcing vow renunciation; Librarian's ledger anchors prior causality for earned independence; minor reflection abstraction in memory block but interleaved with micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of sundial-hum-door pattern tightening to Charged Poise RR closure; "set the sundial on the threshold as a beacon" reconfigures isolation with legible cost of no craving; orientation anchored early in library/who/when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal shelves and stone circle constrain navigation ("shelves drifted shoreward; passages opened"), charging final beacon image; sundial as micro-setting enables tuning actions; sensory hierarchy (cloudlight, wet-lipped spines) biases via POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled early, deepens via ledger shame forcing vow agency; one tightening (hum alignment reveals memory cost) narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost felt in "without trapping anything inside glass."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges via particulars (ledger supper, scattering faces); final image non-literally answers without moralizing, reweighting absence; earned via struggle, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("every atom kept a different year") consistent under single POV; rhythmic modulation in gestures/foam speech; patterned elision taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful tidal metaphors woven into action; rhythm varies (short awakening lines to dense wing); minor overwrite in stacked figures ("wet thumb... deepened to late tea") but coherent, not obscuring peak vow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library/reincarnation/extinct contemporaries risks lyric form that heightens stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from established particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
