<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in dream interrogation of jealous envies ("stake nothing... play"), earning final kinder endurance with visible cost to past selves' isolation. Interiority concrete and embodied ("jaded wonder clung like frost"). No stock phrasing; flaws drive method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers from grave shock to dream shards to scroll-writing, culminating in Charged Poise RR ("mouth keep eating the stone") with conceptual cost of endless ledger. Orientation anchored in opening scents/ridge. One tightening via envy-method sorts chaos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cabin micro-setting constrains via table/stove/window/draft, birch bark charges final rattle. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (scents guide chronicler home). Details evolve tactilely ("knuckles creaked") mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos/narrative vs. grave-end) signaled early, deepens via dream-versions' verbs forcing stance crystallization. Agency in scroll-mapping/reading aloud forecloses confusion path; cost in "risking" life legible. Subtle under accumulative lens but coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia/ledger theme emerges organically from grave-scroll-dream particulars, reweighted non-literally in final "wild animal tamed... not to forget." Resonant CR answers persistence question via mouth/stone image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mountains remember me back," faces "practiced being stone") biases noticing; syntax/rhythm modulate with pressure (stuttering clock mirrors confusion). Stable first-person lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors purposeful/patterned (wild/feral cluster) without muddle in peak dream-beat. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops/scaffold, minor figurative density forgiven in taught lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grave/dream-scroll transforms immortality trope via jealousy-method into inevitable ledger poise; bold lyric risk heightens stakes. Irreplaceable perceptual angle on time/memory feels singular.</comment>
