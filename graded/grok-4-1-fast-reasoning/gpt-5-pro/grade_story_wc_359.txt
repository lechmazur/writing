<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetically embodied interiority drives micro-choices like "I stepped where green asked," revealing contradictory repose vs. action; final endurance of oscillating rest earns closure with felt cost of sustained vigilance. No unearned epiphanies; traits constrain without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tones/colors densify hush from "timid as a foal" to "carved harbor," culminating in Charged Poise closure where hush curls "like a cat of light" with conceptual cost of certifying unmeasurable wonder. Anchors clear by para 2; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern's "veins loosened" and aurora colors constrain path-walking choices, charging final "retreating glitter"; synesthetic sensory weave (tone as "rose, then rain") mirrors POV bias without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unfetter hush at sculptor's "first strike" tightens via bell-sync and color-steps, agency foreclosing sleep-risk path; cost legible in "each wave asks you gently to stay," reweighting under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wonder-as-essential emerges implicitly from hush bridging sculptor's "fear" vs. "stubbornness," resonant in unafraid statue gaze and oscillating repose; final image reconfigures premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("chimes stroked the ice into listening") and rhythmic modulation under pressure sustain first-person stability; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops ("hush" recurs purposefully, not synonym-churn); varied syntax propels from repose to "tender click" climax, read-aloud rhythm flawless, metaphors coherent/voice-bound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, glacial hush-certification, and chisel-sync transforms mythic tropes via irreplaceable particulars like amber-sheet fossils; bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
