<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in Ear confessions, where hoarding inks and gilded lies reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost (shaky wrists), earning final honest unlocking; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from map piecing to Ear payment to chamber CR—"voices spilled, clumsy but intact"—reconfiguring lost words as deferred truths with candor cost legible on page; orientation anchored by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Toxic sky and Ear atrium constrain choices, charging final vine image; "glass ribs trembled" mirrors internal ruptures purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover words) tightens texturally via Ear reversal, forcing candor trade-off; agency in confessions narrows options with vulnerability cost felt in "wrists went weak."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emergent theme of deferred truths answered non-literally by voices "deferred until someone honest," reweighting premise without moralizing; complexity in practical motive avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—"gilded-leaf calligrapher" biases noticing leaves/ink—holds under stress; rhythmic modulation peaks crisply at "vine rang like a struck jar."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels but climax metaphors ("ribbon of mist unspooled, beaded with words") verge on overload without sparsity; no loops, varied rhythm supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postal ecology in toxic greenhouse transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
