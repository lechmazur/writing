<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the "smuggled" second mission against checklist duty, embodied in trembling hands forgiven by film; final steadiness after shutter press earned by mentor's trait echo and ritual. Interiority particular via crater logs and bolide names under fatigue. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices like vial setup reveal value hierarchy with melancholy cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to vial clink ("sand grain releases its grip") and photo as Charged Poise closure, reweighting unbranded dawn with legible melancholy cost in "dawnlit melancholy hangs like smoke." Orientation anchored in first lines (crater inspector at cinder cone). Single scene, no shards; lens taught early via timed reactions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moonlit summit micro-setting constrains via pumice tripod and vial chill delaying reaction; crater lake charges final image as "lake forgets the stars" vs stone memory. Sensory hierarchy (cinder/juniper/iron) reflects professional gaze; details evolve causally with dawn band and breeze. POV bias filters via inspector priorities like pennants for wind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (last unbranded dawn) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via vial activation narrowing to photo before mirrors ("first mirror array flickers"); agency in swinging camera forecloses second chance with felt cost ("no second last"). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; melancholy as price unmistakable in hood smoke image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of authentic memory vs branded sky emerges organically from chemical script ("Take it, now") and final pocket proof; resonant non-literal answer in stone's indifference reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and hush invites ambiguity on progress's cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from preservation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature biases to meteoric time ("measuring nights by meteors") and chemical poise; rhythmic control modulates from long-exposure swallow to shutter thunder under dawn pressure. No head-hopping or leakage; compression taught in ritual elisions pays off legibly. Voice as character: syntax mirrors curious faith.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "blue climbs... like frost becoming script" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphors (sky as bread/antlers) purposeful for lyric texture without muddling closure. Propulsion peaks at clink-to-shutter; zero artifacts in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crater inspection, chemical timer, orbital billboards transforms space-age trope via lived ritual; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final grain monument inevitable from prior particulars; no echoes, authentic vision in purposefully curious gaze.</comment>
