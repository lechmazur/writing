<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions (love/fear of failing her twice) driving micro-choices like confession; ghost bride as crucible forces relational change with felt cost in ongoing obedience; earned renunciation of past silence seals arc without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cameo appearances and memory vision build to Charged Poise closure where bead pressed into palm reconfigures debt as perpetual with conceptual cost ("keep paying"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass aisles, copper grafts, and bead constrain choices (e.g., tuning flasks, ghosting trellis) and charge final image of ash-lifting veil; sensory hierarchy (frost bloom, sap thunder) reflects alchemical urgency; spatial choreography coherent in single scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resonant awakenings via oath) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through confession and name-speaking that forecloses silence with relational cost; agency in "Teach me" and bead-use narrows options; cost legible in perpetual debt obedience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory/oath binding death emerges organically from particulars like sap-remembered thunder and bruise-glow pears; final image of "orchard remembers us" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting endless night as held breath; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical idiom ("stringed flasks," "oath turned instrument") modulates with intensity; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("patience is a dry river"); stable first-person POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion varies with scene (short confessions amid long images); high density in lines like "pear took on a bruise-glow, like moons taught to remember sunrise"; minor figurative density in peak appearances borders overwriting but voice-consistent, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ghost romance with memory-as-sap transforms tropes; bead's evolution from heart-call to final weight feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
