<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to prove listening heals drives micro-choices like calling for coffee and benches, embodied in sandstorm calm against inspector; neighbors like Mrs. Lin and Javi apply targeted pressure via memories. Internal conflict between patience and intrusion shown in steadying wrist under gaze. Minor abstraction in repeated self-descriptions slightly dilutes embodiment at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: neighborhood storytelling densities pattern of memories tightening to locket clue and mailbox click; orientation anchored in first paragraph (courtyard, dawn, mailboxes). Closure as RR (Charged Poise in letters softening grudges, cost of patience vs. cutters). No orientation debt; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vibrant courtyard constrains gathering vs. drone/inspector intrusion; selective sensory (dust hush, spoons clinking, locket rattle) filters through curator's priorities (stains like handwriting). Mailbox cluster and benches guide choices spatially. Recurrent locket charges final image, mirroring internal healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mailbox mystery proves listening heals) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via story mosaic to inspector's cutters narrowing options; agency in half-moon press forecloses forced cut with relational cost. Inspector forces stance crystallization under lens. One tightening sufficient, cost legible in held patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening heals emerges organically from stories → letters releasing grudges, resonant in note's "listen first" without stating moral. Locket/mailbox reprise reweights communal pattern. Complexity in outside intrusion yields ambiguity on developer threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature in reading "stains like handwriting" and locket weight; voice poetic yet biased toward thrift-curated details. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (prayers, inspector's frown). Rhythmic modulation under stress consistent, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (dust like hush, click like teardrop) propel beats; varied rhythm suits accumulative tone. Minor paraphrase loops ("outside world intrudes" twice) and repetitive "neighborhood storytelling" create slight scaffold without obscuring closure. No heavy artifacts in peak (locket open, mailbox click).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh thrift-curator lens transforms mailbox mystery into communal listening ritual; locket half-moon ingenuity grows from particulars. Risks poetic compression effectively charging closure without gimmick.</comment>
