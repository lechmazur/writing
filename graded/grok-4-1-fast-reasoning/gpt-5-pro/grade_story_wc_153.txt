<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses—hunger, rebellion, fear of weeping—act simultaneously in the hospital shard, earning the stay and stitching; medium's fierce tenderness applies relational pressure without safety-hedging. Micro-choices like hand on splinter reveal values hierarchy with cost. No diagnostic speak; embodied ache "like tide under a pier" particularizes flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (roots, tide, moonlight) tightens to Charged Poise closure where mangrove folds back, letter left bears felt cost of relief/unnecessity. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (mangrove, letters, moment before deciding). Single shard transition legible; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mangrove roots constrain stepping onto boat and shivering with medium's whisper; shard as micro-setting charges hospital breath via stenciled moonlight. Sensory hierarchy (copper air, silt voice, antiseptic/orange peels) reflects POV urgency. Houseboat evolves causally from stranded to rocking acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find moment before deciding) signaled in opener, deepens via evocation into hospital where staying forecloses smoking escape with splinter cost. Accumulative pressure coheres: spirits sing relentlessly, apology fog gathers, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in "evoke it" narrows options; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gentle choice emerges via particulars: roots curl like fingers, avoiding tidy moral; final image reweights "moment before deciding" with patience as blade. Subtext in unspoken apology fog carries complexity without equivalence. No thematic echo; resonance from shard's teeth under moonlight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (tide/roots/moonlight bias) stable, modulates rhythm with intensity (short breaths at "I do not smoke; I stay"). Compression taught early pays off in charged poise; no head-hopping. Medium's dialogue silt-laden, distinct from POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "moonlight stencils silver along the shard's teeth" advances image/ritual/emotion). Metaphors coherent/patterned (tide, stitching, roots) without muddle in peak shard; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density in opener tamed by propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mangrove medium evokes pre-decision breath via shard/condensation, transforming regret tropes into tidal mercy. Risky lyric shard heightens stakes (witness without change) coherently. Irreplaceable: labyrinth's copper lullabies ground emotional specificity.</comment>
