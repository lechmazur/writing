<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archivist's reactively visionary trait compels patient heartening amid collective return, embodied in ribs tapping at valve; internal endurance earns closure practice without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments densify to CR in "practice our returning becomes meaning," with valve fitting as tightening that opens breath-room absence at cost of ongoing non-erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rain's "ten thousand knuckles" and brine-laced quays constrain climbing and mo(u)ring pauses, charging final reassembling image; sensory hierarchy biases to sea priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of compiling meaning tightens texturally via valve to permission's abrasion, forcing endurance of navigated absences; cost unmistakable in houses stopping flinch but requiring endless practice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of breath over trumpet emerges from particulars, final "light takes" reweighting silence as warning without stated moral; ambiguity lingers in practice's accountable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ropes sneeze," "salt and rumor") modulates rhythmically under patient pressure; minimal dialogue natural, boy's query subtext-rich.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in "lanterns spaced along a fogged channel" propels without loops; figurative vehicles cohere physically, read-aloud rhythm varies from knocks to abrasion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Absences-as-instruments premise transforms exile trope through valve's herald warning; bold lyric accrual risks pattern-teaching for breath's fresh reconfiguration.</comment>
