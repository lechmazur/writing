<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (pacifism vs. father's call to vengeance) act simultaneously when she pours the dust line, compelling her earned renunciation that weaves him into continuity with visible cost to his old life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from father's return to storm thrumming, landing Charged Poise closure as he loops sheath over peg, reconfiguring options with felt cost in his "map burning quietly."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dome and sandbag scraps constrain choices (threading fractures during gale) and charge final image (cuttings at seams), with sensory details like "fragrance walking the dome" mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of continuity vs. chaos signaled early, tightens accumulatively through storm forcing shelter tactics; her agency in stitching dome and speaking to plants forecloses vengeance path with legible relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of restraint as "tranquil blaze" emerges organically from rose inculcation and dust line, resonant non-literal answer in final planting image reweighting chaos into "script" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("engraved quiet," "voice grows roots") modulates rhythmically under storm pressure; sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("your way has heat"), POV stable and biased toward patience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied syntax, no loops); figurative pattern ("blaze," "sings") taught early, coherent in peak storm beat without muddle, read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tower desert lyricism transforms tropes (returning warrior redeemed via gardening); risk-taking in voice-heightened stakes culminates inevitably in "dust into possibility."</comment>
