<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in risking destabilization despite Glasswright's warning, rooted in past failure ("measuring time as a line instead of a fold"); final choice earned with embodied cost. Interiority concrete and particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Resonant Reconfiguration closure; cost legible in "the seam closed, the orchard settled back into its drift." Orientation anchored early in glass orchard; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (panes inhale frost, orchard shakes) and charges final image; recurring glass panes as micro-setting evolve causally. Sensory selection vivid and POV-biased, e.g., "bottled whisper... hisses a line of breath."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compress eternity) signaled early, escalates via pattern recognition and press-loosening under accumulative lens; agency forecloses stability with visible cost in rupture. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief folding time emerges organically from particulars like fractures "shaped like hands reaching and withdrawing"; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance in "eternity... agreed to be held for a heartbeat."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in surreal diction ("veins are fragile lines of script"); rhythmic control modulates pressure, POV stable. Glasswright's dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density with multi-job lines; metaphors coherent and purposeful, no overwriting in peak ("the press bite down... with a kiss that was both careful and wild"). Propulsion perfect to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of orchard-press-grief transforms tropes; risk in inkless method and sky-arguing pays off in inevitable closure image. Bold, committed vision.</comment>
