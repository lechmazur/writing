<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Otherworldly sentimentalist narrator's motivation to preserve echoes and share light drives micro-choices like coaxing starlight and rebuilding orrery; stranger's serenity fractures authentically in "expression fractures into rain" during climax, earning relational reconfiguration with felt cost. Internal ache embodied concretely without labels. Minor abstraction in ancestral vows slightly dilutes peak embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as textural density of garden echoes and gear meshing builds to Charged Poise closure in orrery tick and gear placement for next caretaker; cost legible in "old ache...useful" and trust-planting interval. Orientation anchored early in nebula garden tending. Single continuous scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nebula garden's helium flowers, sonar veils, and moth-whales constrain navigation and light-sharing tactics; recurring pollen snow charges final arcades approximating infinity. Sensory hierarchy (pings over visual pretense) reflects caretaker bias. Micro-setting via gears and orrery shapes climax choice without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gentle light-sharing vs. fire-escape tightens accumulatively via shared gear histories to orrery rebuild, forcing tradition shift; her "pilots teach...outrun fires" reveals moral calculus. Agency in joint echo-cartography and adjustment forecloses escape path with fractured expression cost. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transmission over repetition emerges organically from gear meshing and petal applause, reweighting inheritance in final moss-wrapped gears without statement. Subtext in lullaby crater voice and infinity spiral answers "share light gently" non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "comfort...perilous if never questioned."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature of patterns in petals/winds; voice modulates rhythmically from hush sighs to gear "singing arithmetic." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("teach her how to give light gently"), distinguishing idioms. Experimental compression legible, taught via pings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("quiet sigh of falling petals") building cadence; metaphors consistent (grief-pollen, shadows sleeping) without muddle. Varied syntax propels to peak in "twin gears mesh cleanly." Zero loops or scaffolds; read-aloud rhythm peaks flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nebula cultivation, clockwork gears, and light-transit choreography transforms inheritance tropes into sci-fi lyricism; risk in infinity spiral payoff heightens stakes organically. No derivatives; petal-script evolution feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
