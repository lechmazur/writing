<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Specific traits like chanting and "serious playfulness" reveal character through micro-choices under pressure, earning the endurance against despair; embodied emotion in "tender ache" and silt fingers adds depth. Minor abstraction in "persuade sorrow into a chair" slightly dilutes contradiction at pivotal prep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to RR closure in keeper's whisper ("not one star had returned, but the faces... bright") with legible cost of absence; mosaic constraint shapes tactics throughout, holding lens cleanly. Orientation anchored by arrival at fortress (~50 words).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming fortress and mosaic constrain choices (ivy placements, trajectories) and charge final ramparts walk; sensory details like lichens/vines filter through Lio's priorities, evolving with launches without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mosaic-guided launches and gust reversal narrowing options; agency in ambient adjustments, cost felt in starless outcome charging faces' brightness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of art-conjured courage over literal stars emerges organically from fireworks "conversation" and final "tender concession"; resonant image reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of partial victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air kept a ledger") and rhythmic modulation sustain close third on Lio; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in legible closure, no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in launch sequence, varied rhythm reads aloud smoothly; figurative density in climax ("chrysanthemums... luminous seeds") borders overwriting but pattern-taught for fireworks, minor filter echoes ("filter charcoal/fear") deduct lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks ritual/mosaic as anti-despair argument transforms tropes through lived details; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via mosaic payoff.</comment>
