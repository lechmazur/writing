<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's face-blind mapping of voices, gaits, and textures drives micro-choices like pressing damp ribbon to cheek; captain's breath stumble and wrist-holding reveal contradictory guilt/love under pressure. Final portrait unifies opposites with earned cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon testing builds to shared lancing snag and "bell tone," yielding Charged Poise confession with captain's emptied minute as legible cost. Orientation anchored early; closure reconfigures without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry's misted silt constrains pole-lancing without surface break, charging doubled-figure painting; sensory hierarchy (drips, woolen fog, algae sweetness) reflects Lio's priorities and mirrors unification theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of awakening truth via portraits tightens accumulatively through captain's arrival and joint lancing, narrowing to knot-reveal; agency in Lio's naming forces stance crystallization with captain's halting speech as unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ribbon as "nerve, both tether and wound" emerges organically, culminating in painting's doubled outline that reweights guilt/grief unification without moralizing; resonant answer to empathy's ache lingers via charged image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with Lio's perceptual signature (breath arrangements, knot logics) biases noticing; sparse dialogue subtextual ("which side... to find her") advances without declaration, rhythmic control intact under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Figurative density (mist "curls like breath," ribbon "flirted with currents") purposeful for textural lens without muddle in peak snag/confession; varied syntax propels to painting's image, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's sensory portraits transform cold-case detection into opposites-unifying empathy siren; risk of poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via methodical pole/ribbon climax.</comment>
