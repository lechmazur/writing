<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in childhood drive intensifies to petition and risky ascent; interiority embodied via chain link mooring "shaking thoughts." Inea applies pressure as foil, her breath revealing shared awe. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from teaching to petition/practice/ascent; Charged Poise closure in "We rise by that chart... city hums farewell" with cost in "snapped like brittle threads." Orientation anchored in opening lines; pattern taught early holds to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Domes, projector, chain link constrain choices (fits collar, pocketed for walks) and charge images like "dome has cracked... scumble that catches light." Sensory filter (brine, pressure, plankton pixels) reflects POV urgency; recurring chain link recharges father's memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of upward star navigation vs. trench expansion signaled early, tightens via petition "narrow yes" and "time-soft window" risk; agency in drafting route forecloses safe darkness with legible cost. Accumulative cadence shift reweights options in ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of edges revealing truth emerges via projector ring and alien method, resonant in final "horizon lies flat as faith" reweighting submersion premise without moralizing; subtext in council tension adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in edge/refraction imagery ("where refractions knife"); rhythmic prose modulates from somber ("held breath") to charged ("starlight sifts"); stable first-person with no leakage, lyric compression taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative consistency ("light loses patience," edge motif); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds; closure image crisp, no overwriting in peak ascent beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of submarine star-navigation via edge geometry transforms alien-contact trope; ascent risk feels inevitable from particulars, bold lyric structure heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
