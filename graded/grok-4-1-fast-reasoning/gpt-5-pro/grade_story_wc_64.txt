<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation to map intentions via listening is embodied in precise micro-choices like aligning pebbles and setting the chessboard, revealing contradictory blitheness amid grief without epiphanies; final endurance of ongoing work feels earned with conceptual cost in persistent questions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from silo's echoes to chess reconfiguration, with on-page Charged Poise closure ("echoes thinned, not vanished") reweighting stakes; cost legible in softened stories carried forward, orientation anchored early in cemetery routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silo, tapestry, and sovereign case as micro-settings constrain listening choices and charge final image ("tapestry that now hummed less like a wound"); selective sensory bias (soil-blackened palms, thrum) mirrors gardener's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving intentions tightens texturally via chess tutor's echo, narrowing to renunciation (carry king half-square); agency in pressing clock forces stance, with felt cost in unspent apologies foreclosing triumph/shame binary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "softness can carry a weight sharp brightness only shatters" emerges organically from particulars like mending graves with stories, resonant in final image of combed paths and kinder night without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in woven metaphors ("pruning moss like errant thoughts"); rhythmic modulation heightens hush at chess clock's end, elisions taught early via ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("Rowan stepped from the tapestry") without loops or muddle; figurative layering purposeful in peak (tapestry as "mouth"), clarity intact at closure image of dew-silk stones.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardener as cartographer of intentions via thimble-shadow case transforms cemetery trope; risk in poetic cartography ("sextant" alignment) heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
