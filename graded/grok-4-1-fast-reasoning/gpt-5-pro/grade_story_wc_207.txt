<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's sensibly eccentric trait drives concrete micro-choices like knotting the cord and vowing to return, earning the final caretaking role with visible caution amid mystical pull. Interiority embodied in tingling fingers and heat through calves avoids labels. Contradictory impulses (test vs. delve) act simultaneously in the chamber kneel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from psychometry echoes to vial collection, holding to Charged Poise closure where "I am the caretaker... with a vial and an empty case" reconfigures knowledge with the vow's felt cost of partial revelation. Orientation anchors early in cliffs post-factory. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught by compass quiver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Limestone seams, cold-breathing cleft, and salt-silvered lagoon constrain choices like cord-knotting and needle-pressing, charging the dry niche glow. Sensory hierarchy (petrichor over visuals) reflects collector's bias, integrated via tactile navigation. Final shine in footprints mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find explanation-failure place signaled early, escalates accumulatively via psychometry deepening (five hands to shadows in veins), narrowing to vial choice with agency in needle-press. Cost legible in foreclosed full immersion per vow, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hush as pre-language breath emerges from petrichor vial and explorer-shadows, reweighting explanations via final image of metallic wind and forgotten waves without moral state. Complexity in hinged ambiguity lingers earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in resonant phrasing ("hush poured into every bolt") biases toward smells and echoes, stable first-person with rhythmic modulation under delve stress. No head-hopping; compression taught early via psychometry blooms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "needle quivers like a trapped bee" propels via varied rhythm, but minor metaphor density in chamber ("veins themselves") borders overwrite without obscuring closure. No loops; purposeful "hush" recurrence pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry-compass and petrichor mysticism transforms cave trope via hinged seams and vial paradox, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightening stakes to inevitable caretaker poise.</comment>
