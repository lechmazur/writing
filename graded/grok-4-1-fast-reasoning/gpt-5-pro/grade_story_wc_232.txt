<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's empirically intuitive trait drives concrete micro-choices like following ants and testing footholds, revealing internal conflict between drifting loneliness and sister's promise. Contradictory impulses act in-scene during cavern insertion, earning final community shift with visible cost of foreclosed isolation. Father's typesetter backstory anchors chip handling without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ants' path causally accumulates to cavern press activation, tightening via chip fit and map seam revelation. Orientation anchored early in shop/creek/valley. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with cost in "loneliness had been a habit, not a fate," reconfiguring routes without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blooming cavern and creek constrain choices (ants' seam down culvert, rising water urgency), charging final chip glimmer on counter. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: limestone smell, torn silk creek sound reflect empirical intuition. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from path to chamber heart.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find doorway before creek washes chance) signaled via map note, deepens at chip insertion narrowing life-fork options. Agency in touching seam forces trade-off: internal doorway over escape, with felt cost in community return. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens via density of glimmers/ants/maps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of choices vs. drifting emerges organically from map forks and ant roads, reweighted in final image of chip/ants/crumbs as "tiny treaty." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like Y-chisel ties father/sister without abstraction. Protagonist arc inextricable from promise's compass-turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: empirical notices (calipers, limestone) bias details like "measuring distances with calipers and leaps of hunch." Voice rhythmic, modulates from humming heat to thundering rock; no head-hopping or withholding. Prose texture distinct in glyph/ant similes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels: lines multi-task sensory/pressure/character (e.g., "ants poured into it like ink returning to its well"). Minor figurative density in cavern beat but pattern-taught via glimmer motif pays off without muddle. No loops; rhythm varies, read-aloud natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of printing/maps/ants/colony into life-fork doorway transforms magical realism tropes via empirical pilgrim's grounded choices. Irreplaceable chip-cavern fit and ant-guidance heighten stakes organically. Risk in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
