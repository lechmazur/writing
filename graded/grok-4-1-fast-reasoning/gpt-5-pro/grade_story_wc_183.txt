<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the twin's manifestation—"I am the twin and the gardener both, but the ship disagreed"—earning the integrative closure choice with embodied cost in joint storytelling. Interiority particularizes via "shadow came doubled" and "nearness of what I had named." No unearned epiphanies; flaws like trembling hands compound under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from emerald card unlocking door to garden's syllables linking, culminating in Charged Poise closure—"we told the worst part together, and the mirrors held"—with legible cost in "without drowning ourselves" and seeds as map. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in ship/bay details. No causality breaks; experimental mirror plurality taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: "salt and sawdust" hinge exhale and "chalked letters that dusted our wrists" constrain choices via braiding paths. Ship's rocking/t tilting mirrors internal multiplicity, charging final unmooring image. Recurrent rigging/carousel grounds spatial choreography without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapturing names) signaled early tightens accumulatively: barker's "Bring her" forces twin integration, deepening to joint "worst part" telling with cost in bargain's honesty foreclosing solitary path. Protagonist agency in tugging threads and speaking drives escalation; mirrors holding tests commitment without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of spoken-return solace emerges organically from particulars like blooming syllables and "solace kindles... from spoken return," reweighting "trapped freedom" in final stitched-map image without moralizing. Counter-readings linger in ship's "honest bargains"; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic compression—"paint peeled in ribbons, rust sang a quiet metronome"—modulates rhythm with pressure, shortening under tilt. Stable first-person; automaton's "brittle rhymes" carry subtext naturally. Purposeful elision of twin's full history taught via marrow cue pays off in manifestation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels: lines multi-task (e.g., "vines climbed the rusted arms, blossoms carried chalked letters") without loops or scaffolds. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor figurative density in mirror parliament coherent and pattern-taught, not muddling peaks. No template cadence or drifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival decay as name-garden transforms tropes via chimera/narrative threads, risking lyric accumulation that heightens stakes in garden tilt. Final "map stitched inside" feels inevitable; no derivative echoes, bold premise commitment throughout.</comment>
