<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic Mara moors the protagonist through practical actions like scanning breakers and demanding "Consent," forcing micro-choices that reveal internal contradiction between leaked appetite and crafted listening; final endurance to "learn to listen with craft" earned by relational pressure. Minor abstraction in emotions slightly limits embodiment under peak dance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of light paths builds from somatic triggers to ladder discovery; closure as Charged Poise in clipping coil and sending recall reply reconfigures uncontrolled telepathy into "neighborhood hum" with legible opportunity cost of forgoing pills, anchored early in studio post-shock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Muscovite shard as micro-setting constrains mapping choice by splitting light "fractally precise," charging final image where ladders glow "like a vein ready for healing"; sensory hierarchy (ozone, microflinches) reflects POV urgency without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to control leaked empathy tightens via wristband-triggered dance revealing hidden path, narrowing options under Accumulative lens; cost felt in "careful stars" endurance over pill reliance, protagonist agency in somatic-led moves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gentle urban listening emerges organically from thought-maps replacing "the howl," final image of tracing ladders with Mara offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; reweights pill premise via crafted pathways.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "feathered edges of other minds, rasping against mine" biases noticing toward somatic/thought textures; sparse dialogue like "Hold" carries subtext and goal pursuit, POV stable amid poetic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "light obeyed like a dog in fog") taught early, propels via varied rhythm; minor figurative density in dance risks slight overwrites but closure image clear and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy leak + light painting as thought-mapping transforms sci-fi trope into tactile craft; risky poetic voice risks gimmick but heightens stakes in "willowglass hope," inevitable in hindsight via shard/coil payoff.</comment>
