<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's sympathetic skepticism shown through scoffing then apologizing to Estera's memory and giving personal regret at climax, earning change with embodied cost. Lio's grief forces inclusion of painful memory, revealing contradictory kindness. Minor telling in traits slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns densify from tile activation to chamber formation; closure as conceptual repricing when paths straighten after narrator's memory sacrifice, cost legible in "The paths shuddered and straightened." Orientation anchored early in climb and whales.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower's lantern circle and star table constrain tile placement and path-walking; whales' moans guide rhythm, charging final image as they vanish. Sensory details (wind calligraphy, salt fragrance) filter through skeptic's bias, mirroring internal braiding without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to sculpt reflective space tightens accumulatively via painful memory placement, narrowing to personal contribution; agency in chalking and giving memory forecloses avoidance with relational cost on Lio and self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-bridges emerges from tile patterns and avoided squares, resonant in final chamber holding "hollows as well as the seeds" without statement. Subtext in whales' unheard guidance reweights skepticism organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic compressions like "dusk of speaking water"; rhythmic control modulates from doubt to poise, stable first-person POV with no leakage. Voice as character: syntax braids sympathy and skepticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., tile description advances plot and motif); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle. Minor density of figures in peak ("table flared, seams opened like eyelids") risks slight overwrit but pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as memory-bridge with whales' symphony transforms mystic trope; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in chamber's breathing reflection.</comment>
