<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses—compassion amid father's fire legacy—embody in grafting micro-choices under boyish scrutiny, earning final endurance with scar-cost legible; interiority particular via "gracefully alert" restraint. Boy applies relational pressure without caricature, revealing shared burn vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from coin-whispers to choral hums, yielding Charged Poise closure in "healed trunks hummed a tide-song no flame could replace" with conceptual cost of mercy's watch. Orientation anchors by line 2; single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and charred trunks constrain grafts via wind-seams; recurring black sand and coin charge final beach-walk image. Sensory weave (minnow-stitches, kelp-drift) mirrors healing, filtered through firefighter's sap-dream notice; no white-room, vivid economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scars singing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via boy's confrontation forcing vocal proof—"Hear that"—with deepening agency in shared listening; cost in persistent scars/heat memory forecloses fear-path, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of scarred mercy emerges via graft-chimes without statement; subtext in coin's "conductor of forgiveness" reweights fire's "handwriting." Final image answers via "forgiven without forgetting," resonant non-literal CR tying particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("scars read the wind like old sailors") biases toward heat/sap; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You are the one..."), distinct from poetic narration. Rhythmic control modulates pressure, stable distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring breath-rhythms; metaphors coherent (coin as "small planet"), pattern-taught without muddle. No loops/artifacts; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fire-grafts yield musical scars, transforming tropes via coin-pendulum ingenuity; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight payoff in tide-song closure.</comment>
