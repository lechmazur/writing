<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to dissolve boundaries non-violently is rooted in consistent traits like patience and aesthetic drive, compelling the climax reading and speaking; contradictory impulses in soft persistence vs. sacred taboos act in scene, earning the final coaxing gesture with relational cost to custodians' hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as paraphrasing densities build to quartz singing and path ghosting forward; on-page Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "He writes briefly on the atrium wall... boundaries consented to dissolve," reweighting separations with felt cost of past "ban years"; orientation anchored early in atrium arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake constrain choices via quartz response and ice reconsideration; recurring colonnade hum evolves tactilely, charging final hush; sensory selection (cold ink smell, floor lights slippering) mirrors poet's perceptual bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of boundary-crossing signaled early tightens accumulatively through paraphrase loosening quartz to path formation; poet's agency drives escalation, with unmistakable cost in custodian hesitation and ice "little fractures finding each other like kin."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening-induced dissolution emerges organically from particulars like paraphrasing edicts into invitation; final pier stack and wall writing offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise, though explicit phrasing borders thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in aesthetic biases ("salt releases the color in buried shells") and rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable third-person limited POV with clean distance; poet's aloud speech carries subtext without dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud with syntactic propulsion syncing scene cadence; high density integrates action/imagery without loops obscuring closure, though minor paraphrase synonym churn ("rinses it, rephrasing... paraphrasing again") slightly dulls peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic method dissolving literal/metaphorical ice transforms boundary trope organically; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, with "tremor of certainty moving like a thin animal" as memorable, inevitable inflection.</comment>
