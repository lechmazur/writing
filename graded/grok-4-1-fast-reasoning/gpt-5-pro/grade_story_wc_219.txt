<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the pilgrimage build (doubting rituals yet creating one), culminating in the earned admission "my protocol was unruly" that forecloses isolated lab work with relational cost. Interiority concrete via amber handling and spectrometer use. Flawless under pressure, no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory verifications accumulate density to CR closure where "homecoming is an exchange constant" reconfigures the premise, cost legible in shared attention as catalyst and unruly protocol admission. Orientation anchored in first lines. Single scene with legible progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden path and tower constrain choices via footprints and rain; amber as micro-setting charges final sharing on landing. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (molecular manners, resin ratios). Evolves causally with rain polishing stones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chemistry of homecoming) tightens texturally via verifications (boar resin, heron vines) narrowing doubt to convergence; agency in misting sleeves forces envoy response, charging poise at ratio discovery. One deepening sufficient, cost in fasting breath and protocol unruliness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (dusty prints, amber grief) to resonant CR: homecoming as "exchange constant," reweighting skepticism without moralizing. Final descent image answers central question via footprints invitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in molecular metaphors ("manners can be molecular") and rhythmic modulation under ascent pressure. Stable first-person with collective "we" coherence; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Grief, I said, is also data").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "each arc pulled volatile memory"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak tower beat coherent and pattern-taught, not overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of first-contact sci-fi via chemical pilgrimage transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable CR from particulars like salt math.</comment>
