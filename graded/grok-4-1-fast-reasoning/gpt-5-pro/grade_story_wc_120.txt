<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied (pencil shavings, thumb-circles on shell); motivation intensifies through memory-mapping choices compelling the climb and finale signal; contradictory ache/endurance acts in scene, earning final renunciation of forcing breath with visible cost of exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from frost violins to full orchestra via memory cues, culminating in Charged Poise RR ("I hold them... until they learn to hold me back") with felt cost of looming exhaustion; orientation anchored immediately; no causality breaks, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spire, lake, ice constrain choices (climb landings map memories, cracks as timpani); recurring shell/horizon charge final image; sensory hierarchy (frost plucking, cold knifing lungs) selective via POV urgency; spatial choreography coherent through mirrored ascents.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphony before exhaustion) signaled early, escalates via textural density (instruments arrive, horizon as staff) narrowing to endurance trade-off; agency in shell-tracing forecloses forcing breath; cost legible in "cold knives my lungs" and final poised hold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of homesick return without retreat emerges organically from memory-mapping and silence-conducting; final image reconfigures premise (shell baton to mutual holding) with resonant non-literal answer, no moralizing; complexity in ache/kindness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (hushes, spirals, echoes); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to deepening lift under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (each line advances texture/pressure); varied rhythm passes read-aloud; metaphors coherent/patterned (symphony vehicles unify without muddle); zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts, even in peak finale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writer conducting memory-symphony in spire transforms tropes; bold lyric risk (unheard orchestra from silence) heightens stakes coherently; irreplaceable particulars (shell ridges as measures) feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
