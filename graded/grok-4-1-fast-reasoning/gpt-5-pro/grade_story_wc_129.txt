<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in "luminescent ache" recurring with contradiction between solitude fear and belonging dare; final dedication earned via prior micro-choices like sharing marsh stories. Neri's sympathy forces relational crucible, revealing narrator's flaws without hedging. Contradictory impulses act in the weaving beat under shared pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of imagery and kinship webs builds to Charged Poise closure in bench dedication and sigil dissolution, reconfiguring solitude with felt vulnerability cost legible in "held like light is held by water." Orientation anchored by ~50 words in orchard/crater/reeds; one tightening via tag discovery narrows isolation options. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain search choices and charge final bench placement; sensory hierarchy (chiming bells, rain-on-linen fruit) filtered through sculptor's tactile bias integrates into action. Atmosphere tensions solitude with refracted halos, mirroring internal graft. Recurring crystals/reeds evolve causally, no white-room or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting to community) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shared tag search forcing endurance of outsider fear; cost felt in arbor's "gloss stitching faces" and dedication trade-off. Agency in weaving under pressure forecloses solitude path. Minor abstractness in sigil geometry slightly mutes visceral price at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of community as mutual weaving emerges organically from particulars like reeds interlacing sigil and bench lattice; final image reweights premise without moralizing—"roots growing...weaving futures." Subtext in Neri's "stay"/"braid" implication lingers with ambiguity. No thematic echo or tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sculptor's woven metaphors and biased noticing (reeds' "patient memory"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, hushed night-search sentences. Stable first-person with no leakage; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure poise. Dialogue sparse but subtextual, advancing kinship.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sigil blooming...answered my hands"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no template cadence or paraphrase loops despite weave motif recurrence. Figurative density purposeful and coherent in weaving/light patterns, no muddle at closure. Minor overwriting in adjacent crystal/reed images nudges from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-catastrophe orchard and reed-graft metaphor transforms belonging trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via tag's elusive geometry. Inevitable hindsight from early arbor dare to bench payoff; no derivative templates or hedging.</comment>
