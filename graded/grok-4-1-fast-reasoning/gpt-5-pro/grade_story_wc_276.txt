<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cool-headed fisher's motivation roots in promise to girl, shown through embodied calm ("pulse slow, face slack as moonwater") amid rising strain; micro-choices like not fighting the pull reveal values with cost. Internal endurance of echo's tests ("hooks were only steam") earns closure without epiphany. Minor abstraction in traits slightly limits full individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden tremors to net tightening and pocket strain, culminating in Charged Poise RR ("cupped the echo... sealed it with breath") with felt cost in retained wildness ("without losing their teeth"). Orientation anchors early ("fisher poled his skiff through... sound wave garden"). Single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden, skiff, and spike constrain choices (pole furrows, drop into pockets, steady tilt); recurring spike charges final pull ("rail spike turned cold as stars"). Sensory hierarchy (stems shivering, draft of centuries) filters through fisher's perceptual bias. Final image recharges garden sigh, pivotal for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch goddess echo) signaled early, escalates via density (tremors to net keening, skiff tilt) under Accumulative lens, forcing agency in yielding to pull; cost legible in strain ("pocket tried to run"). One tightening (spearing wave, casting net) forecloses options. Closure crystallizes with paid price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ushering untamed emotions emerges via particulars (voicing silence shapes nothing into bait, echo walks through bones); final CR reweights premise ("usher them home without losing their teeth"). No moralizing; resonance from feral contradictions lingers. Subtext in lullaby's dual tenderness/toothiness avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing echo's "footprint... in air," shaping zero into bait); rhythmic diction modulates from slow pulse to gnashing silence. Voice texture distinct (lyric compression taught early, legible at seal). No head-hopping or withholding; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but repetitive phrasing ("voicing silence" x4, "transliterates emotions" x3) creates mild paraphrase loops in mid-beats, dulling momentum slightly. Metaphors consistent/voice-motivated (e.g., "petals of resonance... tidal flags"), no muddle at closure. Rhythms vary, read-aloud strong; minor scaffold drags from high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fishing metaphor with sonic/mythic elements (echo-footprint, transliterating ache into phonemes) feels inevitable; risk-taking in surreal garden transforms tropes organically. Final reconfiguration ("keeper of echoes") heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivatives; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
