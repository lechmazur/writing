<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's "emotionally rational" trait embodies well in "throat heat, then cools it with numbers," revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Tomas shifts credibly from worry ("You will blister the town") to alliance, forcing mutual choices. Minor label-speak in "Fictional Historian Statement" slightly undercuts peak specificity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: letter vines → ivy alignment → descent → ledger discovery → communal reading → publication agreement (Charged Poise reconfiguration with social cost). Orientation anchors early ("Mara Dely steps onto the platform"). Closure cost legible in Tomas's "We will not burn... we will build," foreclosing vengeance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ivy and station constrain choices (vine-tracing finds arch/shaft; lamps paint earth in descent). Recurring ivy charges final image ("truth, like ivy, nails itself to what stands"). Sensory integration vivid and POV-biased (Mara's parallels link lapis margins to chisel marks).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) tightens causally: Tomas's opposition → shared descent → evidence reveal narrows options to "mercy or memory." Agency in Mara's persuasion and Tomas's stance shift; cost felt in "blister the town" weighed against erasure. Escalation coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically via councilman's cipher and phantom fire exposed through ledgers. Final ivy-truth image reweights premise without moralizing. Meta "Fictional Historian Statement" borders overt thesis, slightly diluting subtext in close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Mara; perceptual signature in parallel-drawing (vines to ivy, serifs to bolts). Dialogue natural/subtextual (Tomas's "loose screw" laugh reveals shift). Rhythmic control modulates: poetic in reflection, clipped in descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: sentences multilayer (e.g., "breath chalking the air, and their lamps paint the earth with circles"). Minor motif repetition ("drawing parallels," "pit of lies") purposeful, not looping. No artifacts dull closure; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fictional historian's parallel-drawing deciphers noble lies via illuminated letter in ivy station. Risky poetic conceit transforms uncovering trope; "truth like ivy climbs, not to smother, but to hold" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
