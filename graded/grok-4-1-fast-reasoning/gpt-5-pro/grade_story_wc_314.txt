<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in mapping starlings' ratios into breath while fearing loss of tenderness; final renunciation of forcing transformation earned via prior micro-choices like flame adjustment, with visible cost of held pause.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of observations (starlings, crystal facets) builds to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "held breath that calms rather than starves" reconfiguring options, with crystal as persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's moss bed and stonefruit-iron smell constrain crystal handling and steady her; waterfall's prism ribbons hands in final image, charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harmonize logic/intuition signaled early and tightens via starlings' pattern deepening knowledge; agency in patient flame and brow-press forecloses forcing with felt cost of pause, though no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "two halves singing" offers non-literal resonant answer to when mixture becomes self, reweighting logic/intuition tension without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("flame whisper, not roar"; "airborne syntax") biases toward alchemical wonder; stable single-POV distance modulates rhythmically with intensity, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but figurative density ("dark commas curved," "blue seam") borders overwriting in reflective peaks without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical logic meeting starling murmuration transforms introspection trope; risk of lyric mode heightens stakes of internal harmony organically.</comment>
