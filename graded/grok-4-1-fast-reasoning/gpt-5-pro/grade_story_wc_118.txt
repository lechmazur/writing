<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Odd historian's sensitively perceptive trait roots motivation in embodied perception, as in "carbon dust marking his fingertips like new fingerprints," compelling higher-stakes alignment to the displaced axis. Interiority concrete and particular, with micro-choices like pinning the tapestry revealing values. Lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, but endurance of world's silence earns final inscription.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes and revelations tightens to Conceptual Repricing closure in "inscribing bronze quiet into paper so the walls could rest and the world regain its ear," with cost legible in displaced axis's hinge. Orientation anchored early ("reclaimed silo library"); single scene coherent. Pattern taught immediately pays off without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silo's metal ribs, seams, and hearth constrain choices (e.g., lantern beam sliding along seam coaxes sounds) and charge final image of ladder climb. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective ("boots made a faint coin-clink," "wind rubbed the corrugations"). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states through action without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting wall-stories amid displaced axis) signaled early; accumulative deepening narrows via diaries/tapestry to unbroken account, forcing alignment trade-off with felt cost in world's lost ear. Agency in probing actions forecloses ignorance. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of overhearing self emerges organically from particulars like walls as "vocal cords" and dragons as "diagrams of a displaced axis." Final image reweights premise non-literally: inscription restores ear without moral. Resonance from dragon-neck alignment to seam of dawn; ambiguity lingers in hinge-doorway.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("thrum of settled rooms," sounds as "seeds whose husk the concrete had accepted"). Rhythmic control modulates from hushful patience to deepening bell-poise. Purposeful poetic compression legible, taught early in bronze quiet motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels: every line layers atmosphere/character (e.g., "pages scalloped where flame had licked and withdrawn"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language consistent and pattern-taught (bronze quiet evolves). Varied rhythm supports read-aloud ear without overwriting in peak revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream sci-fi lyricism: walls remembering via thrum, dragons as axis diagrams transform tropes. Risky poetic frame commits fully, with tapestry-hinge turn inevitable from particulars. Bold voice anchors universal loss in specific silo tilt.</comment>
