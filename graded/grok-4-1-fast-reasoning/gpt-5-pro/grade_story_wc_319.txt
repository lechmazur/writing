<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the final refusal to cross ("love sometimes means not crossing a line"), earned by prior waiting and teaching; guardian's homesickness flaw drives honest micro-choices like sharing pendant and method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pendant use to comma insertion to book-window, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("we sat again and waited, keeping the veil of sleep ajar") with legible cost of renunciation in the line "He did not step through, and neither did I."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist constrain choices (cold interiorized into sleeves, halting shiver); recurring frost/ice charges final image of warmed waiting, with micro-setting like sundial enabling path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriend uncertainty/help homesickness) tightens texturally via waiting/method-learning, forcing renunciation at book-window; agency in "let us open what we can" and cost unmistakable in non-crossing with felt relational price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty's warmth emerges organically from edges/boundaries motifs shifting to "edges shelter warmth"; final image of ajar veil offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in foggy diction ("words crisp and wet, like letters cut from hoarfrost"); stable first-person focalization biases toward hesitations/margins; dialogue subtextual and advancing (guardian's "help begins when people learn to wait").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm, but dense figurative layering ("glittering needles that drew maps on our tongues") borders overwriting in teaching beats without fully obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of feral librarian, ice-comma key, and "interiorizing exteriors" transforms dream-library tropes; risk-taking in textural drive heightens stakes inevitably toward non-crossing poise.</comment>
