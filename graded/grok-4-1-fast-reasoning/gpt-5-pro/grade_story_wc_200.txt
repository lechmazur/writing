<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied sorrow (e.g., "sorrow-lit tools"); contradictory impulses in pursuing despite fear shown in "modestly fearless" endurance. Final bargain shares refused drowning man memory, earning laugh's integration with visible cost. Flaw complicates without hedging; no therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: confessions and detuning build density to RR closure where laugh integrates after memory bargain, reconfiguring stance with emotional cost ("rope thrown to air"). Orientation anchored in first line; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in shared confession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gorge, harp, and tooth constrain choices (e.g., echoes respond to plucks, tooth bites seam); sensory vivid and POV-biased (whispers as "half laughs cut off"). Final image recharges gorge as "fresh rafters" in ribs. Micro-setting (harp strings) charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture healing laugh) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via detuning and tooth to agency-driven tightening: memory bargain forecloses defensive path. Cost unmistakable in confessed refusal watching "hat spin away." Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of laughter mending sorrow emerges organically from confessions and bargain; final "laugh followed like a small river under my tongue" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity (sting and stitch). No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("mist finding shapes of former faces"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to sun's discovery without drift. Single POV stable; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (e.g., dissonance unveils seams). No loops, scaffolds, or muddle in peak bargain; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Figurative language serves lyric drive without overwriting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-collecting via dissonant harp/tooth transforms tropes; laugh's "clever fox doubting kindness" and bargain risk heighten stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from gorge's throat to ribs' rafters; no hedging or templates.</comment>
