<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—whimsical listening backward versus perceptive interjections—act in scene, earning final endurance of "lilac unease settled... worth heeding" through micro-choices like the banister diagnosis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hush density builds to water-threading RR (Charged Poise), reconfiguring noise into balance with cost legible in "not cured, but our noise learned to lean"; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no waiver needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto mist/sand/tile flake constrain choices (drawing circle, placing messes) and charge final sigh/emptied pocket image; sensory hierarchy (lilac unease in ears/ribs) reflects perceptual bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in mess) signaled early, tightens via water revealing "map of breath" where "standing hurt" forces endurance with agency in mandala strokes; cost unmistakable in foreclosed cure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hush/meaning emerges from particulars, final hallway banister image offers non-literal reweighting of "balance instead of the answer" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading glances as... smudges") and rhythmic modulation under hush pressure; stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("tide reversing, revealing... ribs") in peak but pattern-taught and legible, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grotto mandala/unlearning transforms quiet endurance trope; risk in lyric hush patterns heightens stakes organically to charged final forecast.</comment>
