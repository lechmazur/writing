<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between haunted ambitions and methodical calibration act in ritual micro-choices like rail rotations; final renunciation of mastery earned via fruit-listening realization, with embodied cost in "steady enough to hold the bridge without owning it."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual density (seed-coil-fruit) reconfigures understanding of transition; closure as conceptual repricing lands on-page with cost in foreclosing rescue, legible in "not to reverse the current, but to tune it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor constrains choices via rail junctions and fields aligning the seed; recurring rails charge final image as hands holding "the warmth of her hands," with sensory hierarchy (ozone, ringing) filtered through translator's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to understand transition escalates texturally via deepening realizations amid ritual pressures; agency in analogical adjustments forces trade-off from ownership to listening, cost unmistakable in "mastery would only fracture the incline."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of gradients over cliffs emerges organically; final image of palm-writing and student promise offers non-literal answer reweighting thresholds as commons, resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in analogical diction ("wedges pressed into wet clay") and rhythmic modulation heightens ritual pressure; stable first-person POV with purposeful lyric compression pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel beats; purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle, though slight figurative density in coil-growth passage ("tasting salt, tasting ozone") borders overwriting but supports textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of cuneiform analogies with magnetic physics transforms transition tropes; risk-taking in lyric sci-fi heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via glyph-rail mappings.</comment>
