<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied guilt (scar as accusation turned lodestar), with contradictory impulses in risking the last braid despite ache; earned change in forgiveness compelling higher-stakes casting choices. No safety-hedging; flaws like prior absence complicate present unlocking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to braid reconfiguration climax, landing Charged Poise closure in organ's inhale and protagonist's choice to stay, with legible cost in physical labor and risked guilt. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, one tightening via card-rope mapping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice walls, ropes, aurora constrain choices (braids demand gentle fingers; chill tests purpose); recurring lamp shadows charge final casting image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (maker notices tensions/weights); details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) signaled early, escalates via braid adjustments resolving wheezes into syllables, forcing endurance trade-off; agency in slipping card and aligning scar-guided knot narrows options under lens. Cost unmistakable in shoulders aching as lamp burns low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation over erasure emerges organically from particulars like punched holes braiding into civic oaths; final image ("world... brightens for work") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting forgiveness premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in idiomatic noticing ("breath sparking like tin shavings," "syllables stretched limbs"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity, prose as character reflecting maker's gentle precision. Stable single POV, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (each adjustment yields note); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors (paper rasps oath, names in harmonics). Minor fig lang density in peak fits taught lyric pattern without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax casting sounds via rope-organ unlock transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early card-rope mapping to bronze tongues.</comment>
