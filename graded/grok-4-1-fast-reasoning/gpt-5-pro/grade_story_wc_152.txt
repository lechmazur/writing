<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through concrete micro-choices like "shift a star one stitch" revealing contradictory impulses (subtle sabotage vs. overt warning); final endurance of coup's inevitability earned by patient listening pattern. Flawless embodiment of flaws driving struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from hesitations to gate-wail disruption, landing Charged Poise closure in "futures stitched" with legible conceptual cost of frayed certainty. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Orrery rail and dome hush constrain choices (aligning cloth to streets) and charge final reset image; autumn's "blue hush" filters POV bias poetically yet purposefully. Sensory selectivity sharpens urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (subtle coup-fraying) escalates via agency-driven deepenings like bending flame's "heartbeat of doubt," narrowing sync options under accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "coup would still come... but now its clocks would slip."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-through-misalignment emerges organically from stitching particulars, resonating in final "hush, futures stitched" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in coup's patience vs. her chart's safety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in embroidery diction ("ink would bloom," "seam picks apart") modulates rhythm under pressure; Rauk dialogue brief but subtext-rich ("needle-mystic"); stable close third-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "She laughed loudly... assured that folly had won again" advances plot/character/voice); figurative consistency voice-driven, no loops or muddle in peak disruption beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery-as-espionage transforms conspiracy tropes; bold lyric risks heighten stakes via cosmic subtlety, culminating in inevitable "time itself sounded less alone."</comment>
