<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses in collecting others' weights while facing personal trap ("boundary-lessly trapped, not by walls, but by the way paths folded"); final acceptance of circle earned via prior weighings. Micro-choices like tilting lamp reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered weights and shingled readings, culminating in Charged Poise RR when lamp-star alignment sighs the valley's burden, reweighting staying/leaving with binding-as-ribbon cost legible in final stitching image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze seams, shingled hush, damp scallops constrain choices (lamp lick reveals measures, hands read roof); whalebone reverie and salt-pine smells charge final cord image, mirroring internal states through tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting vs. own staying/leaving burden) signaled early, deepens via figure's question and alignment reversal that crystallizes trade-off; agency in orienting/tilting forecloses freedom illusion with felt binding cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens and trapped freedom emerges organically from particulars like calcified beads and ribbon cord; final image ("freedom here is a circle so wide it feels boundary-lessly trapped") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fractal-weaving lens ("thread hearing into shapes you can weigh"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity, stable single POV biases notice toward weights/reveries without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in varied syntax, purposeful repetition ("orienting properly") taught as pattern; minor metaphor density in peak ("ribs bleached and patient") risks slight muddle but coheres without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal-weaving emotional weights in breathing grotto transforms reverie tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with valley-figure turn inevitable from prior self-similars.</comment>
