<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Particular interiority shines in "words were the smallest gears I trusted," rooting motivation in consistent exactness; micro-choices like placing the book on the dais earn the final unification with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as circling builds density to CR closure in "the illusion folded itself into the definition we had made together," with undeniable conceptual cost legible in the breath-door opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "shelves curved like ribs" and dais humming constrain circling choices and charge the final image of history easing around it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling illusions escalates accumulatively through braid thinning on second circle and book placement forcing chorus flattening, with agency-driven cost in stopping counting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unifying via shared seeing emerges organically from dictionary roots to resonant final image "walking out, I arrived further in," reweighting illusions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ink warmed" and rhythmic modulation under rising density sustain first-person stability, with purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration like "dust into small constellations"; minor figurative density in circling beats coherent and pattern-supported, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dictionary roots (ludere play) transforming spiral arbitration premise feels inevitable, with bold lyric risk heightening stakes in unification image.</comment>
