<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Insomniac poet's motive to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" roots all micro-choices, from gathering chalk to singing the lullaby, with embodied ache persisting as earned endurance cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from postcard inciting to choir negotiation, tightening via blossoms' wary responses; Charged Poise closure in "We store the vow inside the postcard, and the paper fattens into bark" lands with legible conceptual cost of unresolved shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell's stairs, murals, and Spiral Choir acoustics constrain navigation and amplify song's reach, charging final image as shell "adjust[s] its posture, as if at last it breathes."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of armistice escalates accumulatively through red's "old winter debts" challenge and gardeners' joining, forcing poet's agency in responses; cost legible in "insomnia... loosens its fists" without full resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-beauty emerges organically via petals-to-vows progression, reweighted non-literally in final "joy is a reef with shadows" image that embraces complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pressed my ear to it and heard a voice like rain on linen") and rhythmic control modulate with pressure, stable first-person POV throughout lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern ("shyly unstoppable") taught early propels without loops or scaffolds; peak choir beat's rhythm varies naturally, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell-world blossoms as factions, transformed via poet's song-negotiation; risk-taking lyric voice heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from ache-to-music arc.</comment>
