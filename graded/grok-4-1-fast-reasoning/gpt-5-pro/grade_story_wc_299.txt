<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "Facts steadied my hands, a railing across an inner ravine where shame kept circling," propel micro-choices to earned final plan; confidently uncertain trait roots expertise post-failure without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from cloth exam to filing cabinet reveal to personal set-list link, landing CR closure in "midwife a new story from stone" with emotional cost legible in ache opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Trailer and cloth constrain choices (pinned like moth, singe match); "wind shuddered through the trailer vents like distant crowd noise" charges final image, filtering quarry grit through roadie perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose post-failure deepens accumulatively via set-list connection ("tour I once hauled"), narrowing to agency in inventory plan; cost felt in "ache open," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echoes after loss reweights via particulars, culminating in resonant "valley answered, a patient calling its own doctor" without moral; subtext in silences and images avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct sound-perceptual signature ("oxblood with gold stripe," "free reverb") holds first-person stability; dialogue subtextual ("You look like someone hearing a song for the second time") advances under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in "promise filigreed with grit and absence"; varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, metaphors cohere to charge closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of buried-gear quarry and roadie appraisal transforms redemption trope; risk in lyric accumulations inevitable in hindsight, heightening echo-stakes organically.</comment>
