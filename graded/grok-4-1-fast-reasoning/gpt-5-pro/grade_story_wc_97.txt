<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pianist's interiority concrete in embodied longing ("steely longing, neither brittle nor yielding") and micro-choices like inserting minute hand; earned stasis in reunion avoids tidy epiphany but reveals hierarchy of values (not asking price). Minor slip: pride recalled as summary rather than simultaneous contradiction in arbor scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from reel insertion to arbor music spilling to Mara stepping into color, landing Charged Poise RR in four clock ticks notching night with conceptual cost of unasked price. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; pattern taught early via film splice pays off cleanly. No ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal arbor as micro-setting constrains refuge choice and charges final image ("arbor opened a path back"); selective sensory hierarchy (tides around pillars, music from grain) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Compasses recur tactilely, steadying under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retune time for Mara) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via film passages to prelude summoning ghosts narrowing options; agency in winding broken clock forecloses endless wait with felt cost (four ticks only). Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness beyond blame emerges organically from quarrel echo to "blame was a timetable we no longer had to read"; final image reweights causality premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like stitched name in melody.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice distinct with perceptual bias (tracks in "broken thirds," compasses "shivering needles"); rhythmic modulation under visionary pressure (short clauses in arbor surge); no head-hopping, elision purposeful via splice metaphor taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("music spilled out, not from keys but from the grain"); figurative coherent in poetic pattern ("branches of surf laced into bowers"). Minor deduction for dense metaphors bordering overwrite in arbor beat without cadence break.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of film sprockets, tidal arbor, ghost corridor transforms loss trope into fresh rule-set (hidden frames as passages); risk in causality-defying encore inevitable from clock-minute-hand pivot. Bold premise fully committed without retreat.</comment>
