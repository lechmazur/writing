<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority embodied in "lungs whistled like reed flutes" and micro-choices like twine paths reveal values under death's pressure; motivation fosters respect with earned pact endurance; contradictory calm vs. whistling breath acts in scene without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to chamber discovery and Charged Poise closure in "ceremony of listening"; orientation anchored in opening lines; cost legible in "six months plenty if no breath wasted," reconfiguring time and kinship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting of living pillars constrains choices, as alignments coax "pillar unlatched another palm of stone"; sensory hierarchy via caretaker's ear on bark charges final image; micro-tools like driftwood hammer integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of remodeling for respect signaled early, escalates accumulatively via storm shift and wire tremor narrowing to pact; agency in circuits forces trade-off of breath for alignment; cost felt in "calm hardened into backbone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies kinship emerges from wire rituals and pillar responses without statement; final "remodel of the heart" reweights premise non-literally; ambiguity in "consent, or at least curiosity" invites reflection with counter-readings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of botanical circuits and living stone dreaming weather transforms ecology tropes; copper wire as translation net risks bold nonhuman agency; fresh pact inevitability from particulars heightens stakes.</comment>
