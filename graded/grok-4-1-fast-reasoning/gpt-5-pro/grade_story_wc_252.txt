<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "argue with the sea the way you scold a beloved child, with combative tenderness," driving the final renunciation of performance with embodied cost; pirate's confession anchors change without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from harbor to island; closure RR (Charged Poise) lands cleanly in "the pier loosens its bolts like kind wrists," reconfiguring detachment with felt cost of lowered pride, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kelp forests and eelgrass constrain the skiff journey, charging the final image where island "rises to meet us with ropes of light"; sensory hierarchy reflects dock worker's tactile priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom via true nature) tightens accumulatively through whale-guided journey and island confrontation, forcing detachment trade-off; cost legible in "walk away from performance," though pirate's late confession slightly softens agency peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-through-surrender emerges implicitly via scrimshaw apologies and island's refusal of ownership; final image reweights premise non-literally as "hauling mercy and lowering pride," with lingering ambiguity in ongoing "work."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("moon jellies write their slow cursive") modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable first-person with no leakage; patterned repetition like "detach" taught early enhances closure without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via image-dense lines, but minor paraphrase loops in "unlocks guarded hearts" (three reprises) dull one peak slightly without harming closure; high density integrates action and motif seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate myth and ecological lyricism transforms tropes organically; risk in personified island and whale-as-oar heightens stakes, culminating in ingenious "bolts like kind wrists" without gimmickry.</comment>
