<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between censorship fear and expressive need act in the vigil and culminate in the earned recitation of the forbidden poem, foreclosing silence with emotional cost. Interiority particular via scar mappings; Mara's pressure reveals Ilya's traits through reaction. Final choice at "he began reciting the poem nobody had allowed" seals change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of storm imagery and reflections builds to CR closure in "hush of ink drying on sky," reweighting scars with conceptual cost of reclaimed language legible in the reading beat. Orientation anchored early in climb and dome entry. Persistent constraint of timer shapes tactics across waits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory, timer, and storm constrain choices (timing the in-breath, catwalk exposure) and charge final image of lightning-scripted sky. Sensory hierarchy poetic: tin taste, chemical-pine smells reflect Ilya's priorities. Details evolve causally with thunder, mirroring internal rarefaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of scar-mapping tightens via Mara's arrival and shared plates, forcing recitation that crystallizes stance under censorship pressure. Agency in timer-setting and reading forecloses suppression; cost felt in "echo with a page turning." Lens escalation via density to cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scars theme emerges organically from redacted notebooks, sky scratches, and recited lines crossing out censorship; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in Mara's "erased but legible" implies reclaimed maps. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature (scars as constellations); voice modulates from vigilant pause to released rhythm in climax. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven: Mara's lines advance revelation. Rhythmic control peaks in thunder-timed reading.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short ticks amid long storm breaths), propels via image-charged syntax. Purposeful metaphors consistent (breathing mountain, rinsed truth); no loops dull closure. Minor overwriting in reflections doesn't obscure "ink drying on sky."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet charting scars via storm-exposed plates and timer-metronome recitation transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in vigil-to-release arc. Inevitable hindsight from envelope seed to folder reveal.</comment>
