<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's ironic clairvoyance ("didn't see it coming") drives interior contradiction, embodied in "uncertainty rings like a bowl" at climax; final invitation earned by prior guidance and surprise, with visible cost in deepened vowel/kinder room.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from pearl placement to shadow's habitation, yielding Charged Poise closure where "shadow within our vowel becomes a resident" reconfigures home/haunting with felt integration cost; orientation anchored by pilgrim's arrival in first line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal cave's draperies/stalactites constrain choices (pearl nest, humming path), sensory sounds mirror internal states via action ("walls ring with kitchen noises"); recurring pearl charges final warmed-palm image, filtering through clairvoyant's biased ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify magic via unseen forces) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through shadow's listening tilt and inhabit request, forcing agency in hummed invitation; cost legible in "vowel deepen, not heavier, but kinder," foreclosing haunting path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of everyday magic amplified emerges organically from pearl-triggered sounds ("spoons chime; broom bristles rasp") to final liturgy of ordinary things; resonant non-literal close in warmed pearl/promise reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (quartz laugh, gulls' beaks) biases noticing toward sonic unseen; rhythmic modulation peaks in hum ("sound walks away like a child"), purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at shadow's breeze-arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cave pearl spins in its nest, centering the tone"); figurative pattern (sounds as objects) coherent without muddle, rhythm varies read-aloud; no loops, propulsion matches textural build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic cave/shadow-in-vowel transforms magic trope via specifics (vowel as home, everyday choir); bold risk in abstract inhabitation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early eclipse chase.</comment>
