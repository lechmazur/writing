<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses excel in "quietly enthusiastic even as doubt flowers" and coin-casting micro-choices under pressure, earning the endurance of faith-as-waiting; interiority concrete and embodied throughout; minor abstract phrasing in reflection like "statistical mercy" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via ritual throws to Charged Poise closure ("angled toward beginning"); orientation anchors immediately; cost legible in final "stellar doubt... tapping a soft rhythm that never resolves."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber residue and railings constrain distilling action and charge final image; sensory details (clinks, hum to honey taste) filter through POV urgency; micro-setting of coins/receiver guides impedance choices pivotal to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wavelength alignment) deepens accumulatively through prophecy revelation and coin patterns narrowing to "hello"; agency in honest scattering forecloses steered intention; persistent doubt as felt cost charges poise without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chance-governed gentleness emerges implicitly from coin-chosen "lullaby... hello," reweighting intention vs. scatter without moralizing; resonant final image answers democratic note question; no tidy binaries, ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in static-as-weather and rhythmic prose modulates with intensity ("breathe, strike the rail twice"); stable single POV with lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (amber tears, doubt flowers) propels without loops or muddle; varied rhythm shines in throwing beat ("collide, spin, and stop"); minor overwrought density in opening doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Post-contraction coin-tuning of new universe via reverse prophecy synthesizes fresh cosmic lyricism; risk-taking in ritual geometry heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
