<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scribe's contradictory impulses shine in insisting on "edges" versus oracle's "pauses between breaths," earning the final shift to silence-mapping with embodied cost in slowed hand and softened fort rooms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from failed charts to aloud retelling, landing Charged Poise closure as booklet empties its gold, reconfiguring endless night into rooms with legible conceptual cost in the final wait.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridge fort and sea constrain via storm pacing battlements and quiet spreading to yard, charging final image where flakes become harbors; sensory hierarchy (grains clicking like teeth, star scraping sky) biases through scribe's distance obsession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map endless night deepens via oracle's ear-edges reversal, narrowing to retell with agency in naming pauses; cost felt in "through being longer than out" and gentler fort actions charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-shore emerges organically from particulars like stick-tapping corrections and swallowed jokes as inlets, resonating in non-literal final image of emptied gold reweighting night into thresholds without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in distance-obsessed metaphors (wind braiding spindrift, star riding like nail) modulates rhythmically under hush pressure; dialogue subtextual ("edges begin at the ear") advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short storm sentences to swirling hush), but figurative density peaks overwrought in "syruped quietude poured from a wound in time," slightly muddling mapping beat coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle's silence-map transforms endless night trope into rooms via gold flakes as harbors, with risk-taking lyric compression heightening stakes inevitably from failed horizons to aloud naming.</comment>
