<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied contradictions like "throat tightens" amid chase vs. porosity impulse; final renunciation of trapping earned via Aria's palette memory and cipher revelation. Blind spots in loneliness drive patient waiting over nets. Voice-specific micro-choices under dawn pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of whispers/light motifs tightening to Charged Poise closure: door unlatched reconfigures capture as passage, cost in "luminous absence." Orientation anchored early in library/archipelago; single meaningful deepening at cipher unfurl. Two-shard ferry transition legible, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mangroves/currents constrain chase tactics, forcing tripod prayer on rock; palette as micro-setting charges exposures. Sensory hierarchy (rust/sleep whispers) POV-biased toward tides/dreams. Evolves causally to bruise sky/splintered light mirroring internal scar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture cipher-bearing dream) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at "bright scar" message narrowing to don't-trap trade-off; agency in letting pass forecloses isolation path with throat-cost legibility. Coherent pressure via dawn clock reweights alone-ness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cipher/ribbon motifs shift from code to "bring Aria home but do not close door," reweighting capture premise without statement; final pier gallery loosens faces as emergent resonance on porosity over quarantine. Complexity in grief/stubbornness lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (paint/flame/copy) modulates rhythmically to peak compression in exposures; stable distance teaches patterned elision early, pays off in unlatched door poise. No head-hopping; inference as heat-defined absence voice-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bellows breathe, palette glows"); figurative coherence in light/whisper vehicles taught early, propels to closure without muddle. Varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with dawn; zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-library + sunrise photography transforms capture trope via archipelago whispers/cipher; risk-taking in lyric cycle ("hush of improbable beginnings") heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable archipelago/palette particulars anchor vision.</comment>
