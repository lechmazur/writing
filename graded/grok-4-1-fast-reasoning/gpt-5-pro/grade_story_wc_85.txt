<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when protagonist presses watch hand despite "sieved hush" warning, earning final letter-writing choice with visible cost of forgoing absolution. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in "chafes like a hair shirt"; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from watch hand to driftwood groove to hidden note, culminating in CR closure where self-ghostwriting reconfigures identity with "tempered regret" cost legible in letter's contents. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings constrain choices (groove fit, levering slat) and charge final terrace image; sensory hierarchy (palms on cool boards, brined alphabet) reflects genealogist's biased notice of "notches for tides, loops for births." Vivid, purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (withheld truth) deepens accumulatively: three-leaves revelation and master's mark narrow options, forcing stance crystallization in letter as agency; cost unmistakable in "would not sell her comfort" amid foreclosed past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forged histories' weight emerges organically via particulars (leaves, hair strand), reweighting premise in final image of "map of the shore and the facts" without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in "tempered regret" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in textured metaphors ("sieved hush," "brined alphabet") biases toward ledger-like symbols; voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, compressing at groove-click discovery; stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances via image-action fusion (e.g., "pressed the watch hand into the groove, it seated with a tiny click"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Black market genealogist premise freshly synthesizes forgery trade with personal provenance sale; driftwood puzzle turns inevitable from established symbols, risking poetic density that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
