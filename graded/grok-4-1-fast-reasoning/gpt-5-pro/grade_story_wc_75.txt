<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to rescue dying arts drives the crossing and discovery, rooted in consistent cultured traits and inheritance of the lens; micro-choices like teaching alphabet loaves and timing the dawn crossing reveal hierarchy of values with visible communal cost. Interiority is concrete and particular via embodied images like "green stitches, tightening my borrowed courage." Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal crossing beat, leaning on summary reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (rosewater, lenses, bread) builds from hush exhibitions to sluice crossing and trunk discovery, culminating in CR closure where "history is a loaf, rising only when shared warm" reconfigures preservation stake with ongoing "river's terrible metronome" cost. Orientation anchored early ("grotto city behind a monumental waterfall"). Single tightening via twin lenses revealing door suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto waterfall roar and spray constrain vision/paths, charged by lenses in crossing beat; rosewater dread evolves from perfume to softening discipline, mirroring internal shift. Micro-setting of theater drawer and sluice door guides choices tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (thunderous silver curtain, steam/flour hum) reflects POV urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue dying arts amid displacement) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via beekeeper absence to twin lenses enabling crossing, foreclosing erasure path with felt exposure cost. Agency in gathering group and visor-reading spray narrows options. Moral calculus in sharing history warm vs. undertow-chased sentences charges final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as shared, warm loaf emerges organically from bread lessons, trunk recovery, and grandmother songs, reweighted in CR ending without moralizing. Subtext in "dread drifted like a scent we wore" invites ambiguity on preservation's endurance cost. Final image ("memory could bow without apology") answers communal rescue question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (light as notation, roar as ceiling) biases toward historical rescue; syntax/rhythm modulates from quick sentences to humming ovens, stable under crossing stress. No head-hopping; purposeful compression of shards legible under textural lens. Voice prose-as-character reflects cultured guide without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "breads as signatures and ration both"), but figurative overload in crossing beat ("green coins, turning water to letters") borders coherence muddle across most sentences, dulling peak propulsion (−0.5). Minor paraphrase loops (wax/honey echoes) but no template cadence; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bold synthesis of grotto museum, bread alphabets, and lens visor transforms displacement tropes into fresh preservation frame; risk in lyric shards heightens resonance without gimmickry. Trunk homecoming feels inevitable from beekeeper map seed; no derivative echoes.</comment>
