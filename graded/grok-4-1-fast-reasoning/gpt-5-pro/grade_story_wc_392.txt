<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through embodied contradictions like "fortified vulnerability" acting in micro-choices (unclipping wire despite career cost); final renunciation earned by escalating discoveries. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. method) play out simultaneously in scene without alternation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations accumulate to control module discovery (~midpoint), tightening to Charged Poise closure ("I will file the report without the erasures") with career cost legible in director's warning. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tunnel's cracked rib, silt tide line, gouges constrain choices (e.g., pacing route with stopwatch); lantern as recurring micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (grit as prayer beads), integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. control) signaled early, deepens via contractor tag and module, agency in calls forecloses compliance path with on-page cost (career ruin). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, single tightening sufficient, cost unmistakable in pocketed earpiece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tunnels leading to freedom emerges from lantern motif shifting (heirloom to signal), entangled memories reweighting present without statement; final image resonates non-literally, answering control via ancestral echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("entangled memories braid") biases noticing; rhythmic compression modulates with pressure (short sentences at grate). Stable first-person, no leakage, voice as character under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "paint gouged in crescents, fingernail deep" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful metaphors consistent (tunnel as lungs/rib). Minor echo of "reverberate" patterned, not loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad heirloom charging modern corruption probe; lantern-door image inevitable in hindsight, risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
