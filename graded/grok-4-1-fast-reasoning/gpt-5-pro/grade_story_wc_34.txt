<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in micro-choices like humming to steady hands and slow encoding, revealing contradictory impulses toward boldness tempered by subtlety; final endurance of quiet advocacy earned with cost in "singing what only the air carries." No stock phrasing; flaws in shyness drive the gentle boldness of pleas.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup of painting layers to ghost's arrival and dispersal; on-page Charged Poise closure in "ghost disperses into the circuits with a promise shaped like a pause," reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of patience. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/storm; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and storm constrain choices via electricity grounding and timing; bolt plate as micro-setting charges final image as "key" left behind. Sensory hierarchy (ozone-crackling petals, prickle on railing) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating needs escalates accumulatively via painting layers to ghost interaction and bolder pleas; agency in encoding forces trade-off of subtlety for impact, with cost legible in ghost's limited levers. Single tightening in "ghost asks what I need" suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet advocacy in gaps emerges organically from petal-encoded pleas and ghost's subtle shifts; final image of blooming circuitry offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting silence as power without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic, song-like diction ("chords in spirals, rests in negative space") modulates with intensity; stable single POV with biased noticing of circuits/whispers, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied rhythm in painting beats; purposeful metaphors (petals as sheet music) cohere without muddle, though minor figurative density in peak slightly risks overwriting. No loops or scaffolds; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cyberpunk ghost and lyrical graffiti-encoding transforms tropes via petal-circuits; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes of subtlety, inevitable in hindsight from early tinkersong setup.</comment>
