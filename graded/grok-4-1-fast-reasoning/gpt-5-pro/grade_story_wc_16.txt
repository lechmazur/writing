<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Relationship as crucible excels: vows force mutual confessions that earn relational reconfiguration, with narrator's flaw (vanishing) complicating choices until "map the boundary between focus and forgetting" pays off with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene (solution vs. her hand). Minor epiphanic sheen in grandmother recall, but anchored concretely.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: vow density builds to door's sigh, delivering Charged Poise closure where shared translation reconfigures frayed collaboration with relational cost legible in "laughter... belonged to us again." Orientation anchored early (archive, linguist, Mara by para 2). Single scene coherent, no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass ink well as micro-setting constrains vows (dipped quills) and charges final image ("capped... unbroken by haste"). Archive specifics (sealed door, scrolls) mirror internal harmony via dust/breath/hum. Sensory weave purposeful, POV-biased toward language/music.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust/open door) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vow tightenings (click, vibration) driven by agency (confessions promise trade-offs). Cost unmistakable: foreclosed vanishing in "tugging me back by a word instead of a wound," charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected truth emerges organically from vow braid, resonating in final "corridor... like a chorus" without literal moral. Minor overtness in "symphonies of truth hold because..." edges toward echo, but counter-readings linger in fragile "door ajar."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (language-as-music) biases noticing consistently; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (short vows vs. flowing reflection). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You forgot this," "You came back"), advances goals. Stable first-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative saturation ("woven staff," "patient cathedral") in peak door-opening risks coherence (-0.4), though pattern-taught early via music metaphors. No loops; rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax purposeful. Propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms reconciliation trope via language-archive premise where promises literally open doors, inevitable in hindsight from vow mechanics. Bold poetic risks heighten stakes (door's "breath") without gimmickry; fresh synthesis of linguistics/music.</comment>
