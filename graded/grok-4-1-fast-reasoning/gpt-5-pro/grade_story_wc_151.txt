<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to "discover meaning in the margins" drives inventive choices under scanner pressure, with embodied reactions like "throat tightens" and micro-decisions revealing values; Mira applies relational pressure without diluting POV. Internal conflict emerges in balancing truth/falsehood for the pseudonym. Closure endurance earned via prior chalk revelation; no major slips touch final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from chalk games to Oona's message ("listen to the white space"), tightening to margin realization that reconfigures letter tactics; Charged Poise closure ("I lower my hand, not yet mailing") lands with legible conceptual cost of slowness vs. safety. One meaningful deepening suffices; orientation anchored early in arcade/post hall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Chalk codes and margins constrain choices (redraw with reversed colors) and charge final image; sensory details like "dew" glowing on chalk and "perfume of gum arabic" filter through POV urgency. Setting evolves causally (morning drifts, arches brighten), mirroring internal discovery without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (clipboard, envelope edges) guides pseudonym craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe delivery via pseudonym) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via chalk message tightening margin danger, narrowing options to decoy/truth split; agency in redrawing and folding forecloses scanner risk with felt slowness cost. One decisive deepening under lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths in edges emerges organically from chalk trails, margins, and Oona's arrows, reweighted in final image of "promise the edges" without moralizing. Subtext in Mira's pinched letter and narrator's "tired grin" invites ambiguity on safety's price. Resonance from particulars like "stamps remember mouths."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (e.g., "arches brighten like brass teeth") stable in first-person, modulating rhythm to pressure; dialogue sparse but goal-driven ("Help me choose a safer self") with subtext. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy lines amid lyric flow); figurative language patterned (light/mouth/coins/teeth) without muddle or loops, propelling to closure image. No scaffolds, paraphrase churn, or register drift; ear-test passes with purposeful cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pseudonym craft via chalk codes in drone-era nostalgia transforms mail trope; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration ("right name at last") inevitable from margin pattern; no derivative echoes.</comment>
