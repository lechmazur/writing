<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's boredom as immortal compels inviting betrayal for mutiny, with contradictory impulses in anticipating Mara's double-cross while guiding the curse transfer; final renunciation of immortality earned via prior setup, felt in "pressure behind my bones sighed open."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as intrigue density builds to spatial flex and curse transfer (CR closure) with cost in allegiance shift; orientation anchored early in prismatic escondite under polar glass; no lens ambiguity, persistent constraint of fragment shapes tactics to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prismatic walls, copper coils, auroral hiss constrain magnetic activation and mutiny, charging final corridor image; sensory hierarchy (hushed thunder, tin taste) reflects POV urgency without catalog; spatial choreography coherent through flex and sigh.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (after-goodbye discovery via mutiny) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pact betrayal and coil nudge forcing curse transfer with agency-driven cost; one deepening suffices, reweighting immortality as shackle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye-as-arrival emerges organically from mutiny and echo, final image ("hush carried thunder... complete") reweights premise without moral; subtext in fragment's paradox enriches without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (shadows alive, footsteps finish) biases noticing; stable first-person POV with rhythmic modulation under storm pressure; minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("your rumors read like maps").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative consistency (braids, tides) taught early pays off without muddle in peak transfer beat; precise causality in "nudged the coils... guided the fragment's hunger."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny via magnetic fragment transforms immortality trope through non-obvious goodbye calculus; risky lyric synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
