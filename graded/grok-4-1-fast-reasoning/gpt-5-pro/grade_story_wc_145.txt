<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied via condensation dendrites as antlers and hunch-betting confidence; contradictory worry vs. subtle confidence acts in waiting-then-scraping choice, earning coordinate-marking closure with visible cold cost on bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density builds to convergence discovery (CR) with conceptual cost in "world wakes and argues"; orientation anchored early in outpost/lake; falcon return tightens single continuous scene without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost window constrain choices (compass aligns with condensation geometry) and charge final image (silvered sweat applause); sensory selection (granite breath, thud intervals) reflects editor's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find convergence) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via glass patterns to ice-scraping reversal narrowing options; agency in kneeling/tracing forecloses tidy estuaries with tranquility's felt worry cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of water's distance-thinking emerges implicitly from pupil-throat discovery and fanning filaments; final condensation routes recharge premise without moralizing, embracing map-truth's resistance complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (rivulets as dendrites, falcon as punctuation) modulates rhythm with pressure; prose texture as dry-witted editor's voice biases noticing toward watery syntax and rumors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (breath cools fastest into throat) propels accumulatively; minor figurative density in discovery beat coherent via pattern, no loops dulling closure image of warm kettle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of condensation cartography and sub-ice pupil convergence transforms river-origin trope; risk in "worrying tranquility" motif heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via editor's hunch payoff.</comment>
