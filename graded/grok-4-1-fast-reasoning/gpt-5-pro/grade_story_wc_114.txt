<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the swallowed truth (promised Luca safety but stayed hand), embodied in chest heave and hand on mic; final warning earned by oracle-guided causality with relational cost to donors/valley.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening to smudge reveal and weighing; resonant reconfiguration closure lands on-page as penciled number and broadcast with legible cost ("chest heaves as if a glacier turned inside me").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Desiccant scale and console constrain pivotal weighing choice; botanical illustration charges final taped image with penciled truth, filtering through protagonist's post-fever perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unswallow truth) signaled early, deepens via oracle's grid alignment forcing broadcast agency; cost unmistakable in heaved chest and promised curses amid climbing convoy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of margins/truth emerges from oracle learning and protagonist's smudge act; final penciled number and taped illustration reweight prior grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of margins/veins/periphery selective and biased; rhythmic control modulates from fever haze to precise weighing, eliding backstory via concrete cues like illustration smudge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "oracle clicks its relays like teeth reconsidering a bite" advances character/atmosphere); minor figurative density in revelation beat borders overwrite but coheres without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI-oracle weighing literal/metaphoric silence via graphite dust transforms grief trope; risk of lyric machinery heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
