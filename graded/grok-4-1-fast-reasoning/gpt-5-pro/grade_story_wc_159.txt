<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of foxglove regret as rhythm in heart, driving oath-bound choices to integrate cracked chime without patching, earning stasis with visible exhaustion cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chime drone to name revival ("Aristea... flushed as if kissed"), reconfiguring silence into murmurs with felt solitude cost in final winding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors (hush of pages, dew in crystal) constrain via chime's fracture catching frequencies, charging closure as orchids "rang, harp-bright and salt-tender."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) tightens accumulatively when fracture "caught fragile frequencies," forcing refusal to patch and assembly of sound-neighborhoods, with exhaustion as legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of breath-preservation emerges organically via orchid-syllables and Aristea revival, final image of orchids "spoke like birds finding shore" reweighting loss into tender seed without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("read silence as one reads water") modulates rhythm with pressure, diction controlled in lyric compression teaching pattern early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (echoes, blooms) paying off at "name unfurled from the cracked tube"; zero loops, rhythm varies propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic-memory library transforms preservation trope via cracked-chime constraint, bold lyric risk inevitable in hindsight as deserted marvels murmur back.</comment>
