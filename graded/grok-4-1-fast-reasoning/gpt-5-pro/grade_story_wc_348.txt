<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (molecules vs. people) act in scene via bridge-building choice under grief's pressure; final endurance of ongoing atonement earned by causal buildup, with relational cost legible in shared teeter. Brother's arrival forces micro-choice revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of river insights → polymer bridge → reconciliation RR (Charged Poise in testing/release) with felt atonement cost; persistent ravine constraint shapes tactics and final chrysalis image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ravine and foam constrain bridge choice and charge closure (filaments flex like muscle); chrysalis as recurring object handled tactilely mirrors internal states, filtering through Mira's symphonic/molecular bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection) signaled early, tightens via message/arrival/testing under accumulative lens; slip/caught elbow shows agency-driven deepening with legible teeter cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of separation-to-connection emerges implicitly via braided particulars (streams/polymers/family); final chrysalis release offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (symphonic molecules/rivers) with rhythmic control modulates pressure; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("maybe we both shed"); no head-hopping, elisions taught via lyric pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; figurative pattern (braiding/zipping) taught early, coherent in peak bridge beat; no scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymers as forgiving social fabric via ravine lab transforms tropes; risky lyric compression heightens stakes in bridge test, inevitable in hindsight (+0.3 risk).</comment>
