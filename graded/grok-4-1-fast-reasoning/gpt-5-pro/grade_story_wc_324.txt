<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's curiosity and job root choices in protecting Eli, with embodied tension in hearing aid pulses and micro-choices like gathering witnesses; Eli's contradictory shame and hesitation act simultaneously, earning his laugh and pocketed photo. Internal conflict surfaces in "voice that rides his pulse says he owes a debt," compelling higher stakes without therapy-speak. Final endurance forecloses suicide path with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from faint pulses to insistent drum and shattering glass, delivering Charged Poise closure in "Eli pockets the photograph, and the borrowed heart keeps its own steady counsel" with undeniable emotional cost. Single scene oriented instantly in atrium; one tightening via warning note narrows options without breaks. Pattern taught early, holds to legible end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist, fountain stutter, and glass panels constrain escape and charge climax shatter, mirroring internal rhythms; hearing aid as micro-setting filters pulses through POV bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows to rain-tin pricks under crisis. Twilight fog hides dealer, guiding choices tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to save Eli's borrowed heart signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pulse escalation to glass shatter, forcing agency in witness-gathering and exit. Cost legible in Eli's shake-then-laugh, foreclosing debt-suicide. Dealer adds coherent pressure without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of voices (dead/living) emerges via pulses and hush, reweighted in final rain "syllables" where city listens, answering central question of protection without moralizing. Subtext in photo's reprise shifts donor's gift from ending to continuance. Complexity lingers in bossy-tender dead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic diction ("borrowed rhythms," "reeling hush") modulates with intensity, stable first-person without leakage. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("dead...bossy"), advances via assurance; syntax reflects poised mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm propels from hush to shatter ("panel sighs free"); metaphors coherent (rain striking tin) without muddle in peak. Concision weaves action/image; final line recharges motifs propulsionally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh heart-tracer premise via hearing aid transforms suicide trope into pulse-memory texture; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at photo-pocketed closure. Bold synthesis of biology/memory feels singular.</comment>
