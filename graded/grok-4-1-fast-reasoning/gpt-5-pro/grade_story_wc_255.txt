<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels with Ilias's colorblind trust in "value, shadow, pulse, and weight" driving micro-choices like slipping the reed into the phoenix crack, earning the final endurance of imperfection; Mara's silence and plant replies add crucible pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from sign-painting to phoenix song, landing Charged Poise closure in "Ilias sits, letting the reed hum... painting the brave cracks" with conceptual cost of practice over safety; early courtyard anchor passes Orientation Test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard's "plank table," "failed phoenix on a pedestal," and plant stems constrain choices (e.g., fennel for courage) and charge final image; sensory hush of "heat and ash" mirrors thematic imperfection without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening imperfection tightens accumulatively through phoenix fix—apprentice's protest forces Ilias's renunciation of norms—with visible cost in glassblower tradition challenged; child's prism laugh crystallizes shift to "practice becomes festival."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in cracks emerges organically via phoenix "sings a note like dawn" and "thready rainbows... broken yet generous," offering non-literal resonant answer that reweights phoenix ritual without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with painterly perceptual signature ("light leans," "texture that teaches air") modulates rhythmically; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in humming reed closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "the crack becomes a throat" with varied syntax and no loops; figurative pattern (rippling words, leaning petals) coherent and voice-motivated, enhancing phoenix climax without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind painting, plant code, and singing flawed phoenix transforms imperfection trope into inevitable "festival" reconfiguration; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
