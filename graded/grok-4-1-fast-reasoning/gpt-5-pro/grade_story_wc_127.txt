<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's affectionate detachment embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as in "a caring that stands a step back from the fire," compelling the final honest reflection with visible cost in being "uncarved again." Liora's grief-driven need forces micro-choices that alter their interaction. Flawless under pressure; no unearned epiphanies or label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from initial static sensing to confession-threading, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "belief kissed doubt and decided to go steady" reconfigures options with conceptual cost in the ripening limit. Orientation anchored immediately in Amber grotto. Single scene causality intact; cost legible in final "humming with leftover possibilities."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber grotto's resinous hum and static constrain choices, as palm on amber reveals "currents of yearning snag," charging final dimming image. Sensory hierarchy (electric prickling, scent whispers) filters via narrator's bias. Micro-setting (electrodes, slate) guides calibration; dusk evolution mirrors emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (channel Liora's grief into courage) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via confession integration, narrowing to "exact instant when belief kissed doubt." Agency in wiring petal and threading accord forecloses submersion with on-page cost in her steadying tears. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Half-truths emerge organically as "bones of bridges," reweighted in ripening closure without moralizing; final image of pressed petal answers detachment's limits non-literally. Subtext in silences and sparks invites ambiguity on counterfeit empathy. No tidy binaries; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in static-as-stethoscope diction; rhythmic modulation peaks in "limestone consonants fusing with amber vowels." Stable first-person POV; dialogue subtextual ("Subsume nothing") pursues goals. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "spidersilk" netting cohere thematically without muddle in peak calibration beat. Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in confession excused by pattern payoff. Clean grammar; final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-dealing via static-sensing in amber grotto transforms counterfeit trope; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise implications followed to narrator's uncarved cost; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
