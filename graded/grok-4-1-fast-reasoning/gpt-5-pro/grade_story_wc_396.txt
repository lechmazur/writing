<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the mirror scene—hesitation darkens panes, commitment knits shard—with final walk earning change via prior thumb-cut cost and relational pressure from envoys.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard to globe projection of "remembered efforts," landing Charged Poise closure in final seam image with humility's conceptual cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice floes "scraped and parted like arguments" constrain mediation timing, orchard ladders/crates guide envoy staging, charging final "lantern sweep" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map empathy to action) tightens via globe-forced promises—"divert sleds," "open cellars"—with agency in narrator's walk foreclosing neutral posture at cost of slush immersion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of "seam between promised and what would start" resonantly reweights theme of neutrality-as-balance without moralizing, emerging from ferryman/bees particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadow-laced peacekeeper") biases noticing (sap, frost clacking); stable first-person POV with rhythmic modulation under envoy stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in mirror glimpses ("vein of light") borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice-orchard setting, alt-life mirrors, and globe as empathy-map transforms mediation trope; risk of lyric shards heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
