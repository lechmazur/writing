<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied listening ("sap move like sea within a sea") and vow-rooted motivation; contradictory defiance-as-conversation acts in fractal strikes, earning endurance with past father's loss as felt cost. No stock phrasing; flaws (youthful impotence) compound to sharpen present agency. Solo POV amplifies perceptual specificity without relationships needed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of strikes builds to closure's Charged Poise as wave "flared outward, divided and softened," reconfiguring defiance into conversation with undeniable ongoing-watch cost legible in final tapping. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity, pattern taught early pays off cleanly. One tightening via cloud readings suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Driftwood rim, trees, bottles constrain choices (assigning "crabapple... high spray"), charging final "orchard now a choir rehearsing breath." Sensory hierarchy (sound over visual) reflects prophet's bias; evolves causally with swell. Micro-setting (sailcloth diagram) propels tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert sundering) signaled early, escalates via textural density in fractal strikes narrowing to "corridor for the wave," agency in timed dubs forcing trade-off (vow's restlessness endured). Cost unmistakable in "resistance as music, not conquest" and post-wave relief. Coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of obstacles-as-instruments emerges organically from particulars, culminating in resonant "conversation" reconfiguration without moralizing; final "music that would not sleep" reweights premise non-literally. Complexity in weather-barter avoids binaries; irony in youthful failure primes earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature ("clouds... like bar lines") modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable single POV, no elision issues. Compression taught early (blue hour pulse) legible at closure. Prose as character: syntax echoes tuning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "fractal generating... garden of pulses") pattern-taught via diagram, coherent without muddle, propels to closure. Rhythmic variety peaks in strikes ("metronome of ankles and wrists"); concision integrates action/image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of musical prophecy and fractal sea-calming feels inevitable; risk in solo, lyric structure heightens stakes via tuned defiance. No derivative echoes; bold premise transformed through lived orchard details and non-conquest closure.</comment>
