<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied curiosity ("nibbles through warnings like moss") and contradictory bravery (sketchbook braver than hands) drive micro-choices to climax release, earning renunciation with time-debt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from sluice stutter to basin RR (Charged Poise in echo release); giant twitch causal tightening with legible repayment cost seals closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and hush-basin tiles constrain ledge navigation and echo cradle, filtering through illustrator's anatomical gaze to charge final shimmer image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to birth echo without waking giant deepens via pendant borrowings and giant shift, forcing release agency with on-page ethical/time cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cadence motif reconfigures meddling ethics through basin cradle image, offering resonant answer to curiosity's price without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature ("pencil listen before it moves"; "tastes like stone, wet feathers") stable in first-person, rhythmic control heightens pressure to echo's skitter.</comment>
