<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carpenter's motivation rooted in "interpret silence as possibility" shows through concrete micro-choices like listening to rails and ripple-free reach; internal tension between patience and longing peaks in restrained breath-note, earning quiet triumph with embodied cost of solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from salvage to oasis discovery to crown fit; closure as Charged Poise in "platform shivered... possibility had begun to show its work," reconfiguring silence into motion with legible cost of persistent labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Train cars and thornbrush constrain path to oasis pond, where "rusted bolts look like reliquaries" charges fragment discovery; recurring wind bells and reeds evolve tactilely, mirroring internal hush to gleam without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening motion escalates texturally via wrong-turn reversal narrowing to fragment fit and breath-song agency; cost of "quietly persistent" dawn labors viscerally felt in "tiny sighs" of oak, charging final shiver.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility emerges organically from breath into wood; final "whispering gleam" reweights hush/motion dialectic without statement, resonant via tightrope singer's echoed lesson on throats singing through listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in chime-filtered noticing ("rails... point like a compass"); rhythmic syntax modulates from hush to "shivered" propulsion, distinct lyric texture taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
