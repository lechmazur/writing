<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete perceptual bias toward "gaps" and "missing," with contradictory trust in absences driving persistent micro-choices against constable's practicality; final endurance as witness earned by prior causality, foreclosing normalcy with isolation cost crystallized in "keeper of their borrowed memories and their witnessed isolation."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of glimpses, patterns, and silences building to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored instantly ("At nautical twilight I stood on the opal dock"); one tightening in decoding "Mira" via light absences narrows options to signal, with conceptual cost in ongoing isolation legible in final jar image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (mist as "page erased," light "between beams") filters through keeper's gap-obsessed POV, constraining choices (dock planks, lens adjustments); recurring lighthouse/opal dock charges final image, mirroring internal isolation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/send message) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern-deepening (glimpses to name to signal code) driven by keeper agency; cost legible in nightly returns and "seam of the world unthreading," charging poise without resolving isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of messages-in-absences emerges organically from particulars (gesture, gaps, flower), reweighted in CR final image ("some messages are for the carrier"); resonant non-literal answer to isolation via keeper's continued signaling, with ambiguity in borrowed memories lingering purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("darkness between beams," mist as "erased page") and rhythmic control modulate with ritual persistence; stable single POV with no leakage, compression taught early via poetic elision paying off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "gaps are the letters of the tide"); figurative language consistent/voice-motivated without muddle or loops; rhythm varies for ear, clarity intact through peak signal beat to final "jar of salt" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse signaling via light-gaps for absent message transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from early "trusted what was missing" premise.</comment>
