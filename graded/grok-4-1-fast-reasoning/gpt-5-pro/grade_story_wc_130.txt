<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied grief ("phantom heartbeat in the pillow") and contradictory impulses toward trapping vs. dovetailing the unfinished; final renunciation of full proof earns closure via prior feral equations gnawing boundaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as drip patterns densify into figure's appearance and chalk-salt fruit; closure as Charged Poise reconfigures uncertainty with conceptual cost in "scaffold" realization, legible in orchard's gift and conjurer's whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cavern orchard's drips and mosaic stone constrain tuning choices and charge final image (apple-shaped stones loosen); micro-setting of glass eyes on stone mirrors internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of emotion vs. absence) deepens via figure's added theorem line, forcing endurance of oscillation; agency in lullaby-speaking forecloses tidy proof with on-page cost of "patient recognition."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's arithmetic emerges organically from tables (joy=expansion) to scaffold realization; final "chalk and salt" fruit offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with perceptual signature (drips as decimals) modulates rhythm under pressure; stable POV biases notice toward "mineral radiance," teaching pattern early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety (hum-patter exchanges); no loops, purposeful metaphor coherence in "equations went feral"; propulsion peaks cleanly in stalactites' slowing without overwriting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes as emotional instruments transforms loss trope via cavern arithmetic; risk in lyric compression heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight at "buried optimism" line.</comment>
