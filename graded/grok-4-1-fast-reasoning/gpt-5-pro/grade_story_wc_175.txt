<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in grandmother's interrupted schooling, compelling micro-choices like steadying the triangle under monarch pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the arrival climax, leaning meditative over conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from interrupted cadence to monarch's reading of frames, landing Charged Poise closure in departure on tilted current with transient cost legible ("collapsed the frames, but not the memory"). Orientation anchored early; no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "clouds moved like sleeping herds" and "gossiping eddies over the cliff" constrain alignment choices and charge final "clouds swam below like slow fish." Micro-setting (reeds, twine) integrates seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal absent histories to last monarch) signaled early, escalates texturally via wingbeat hush to interaction tightening; agency in tilting triangle forecloses capture path with surrender cost. Stakes conceptual over visceral, slightly softening peak charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transience/honoring absence emerges organically from moth wing reprise and final knot vow, offering resonant non-literal answer ("wind remembers us") reweighting prior signals without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("grammar of winds and the honesty of weight") stable, rhythmic control modulates beautifully from hush to thrum; purposeful lyric compression taught early, paid off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but figurative stacking in monarch climax ("petal burning...flame ceding") borders overwriting without variation, slightly dulling peak immediacy despite pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological loss via reed signals and moth ledger transforms migration trope; bold lyric risk in "interrupted cadence" pattern heightens stakes organically toward inevitable closure.</comment>
