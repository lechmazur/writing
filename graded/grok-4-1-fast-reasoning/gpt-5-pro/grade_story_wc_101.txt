<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong Mara as gently persistent leader whose rule and braided-run plan compel higher-stakes choices; Noor/Farid's accusations reveal contradictory impulses acted out in scene, earning their exchange of memories/experiences. Collective "we" POV limits deeper individual interiority but maintains coherent motivations rooted in survival. Final lifting of lighter bell marks earned change with felt cost of nameless endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via repeated images (bell, quiet) holds to Charged Poise closure: Mara's breath across bell gathers pledge, reconfiguring anonymity as protection with undeniable cost of sanctions/watchers. Orientation anchored in first line (arbor, exiles). One tightening in braided run resolves internal rift without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bell as recurring micro-setting constrains donations/routes and charges final image (breath evokes gathering). Sensory details (moon rind, wind rumors) selective, POV-filtered through collective urgency; sanctions alleys guide tactile navigation. Arbor's earth "remembers names" subtly pressures gathering choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nameless support vs. watchers/hoarding doubts) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via accusations to braided run that forces Noor/Farid stance shift. Agency in Mara's plan/endurance forecloses credit-seeking with on-page risk cost (prowling men). Escalation coheres under lens to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of anonymity as trust's "skin" emerges from bell rule, braided deliveries, note's plea; final unfolded seed-note and dawn declaration offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting intergenerational friction without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures (tapped bell, lifted moonlight) invites ambiguity on mercy's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-plural POV stable with collective perceptual signature (stars as coins, quiet as music); rhythm modulates from persistent whispers to dawn clap. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Mara's amplified declarations pursue goals). Patterned elision (runs as shards) taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bell...shivered even in sunlight, as if homesick" advances object/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in metaphors ("tide...lighthouse") clusters non-fatally outside peak runs; purposeful "amplified quiet" repetition teaches pattern without loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions lyricism with bell as memory/donation vessel transforms community aid trope; bold first-plural mosaic of runs/gathering risks high but coheres stakes. Final "pledge braided from anonymous donations" feels inevitable from particulars, heightening quiet endurance.</comment>
