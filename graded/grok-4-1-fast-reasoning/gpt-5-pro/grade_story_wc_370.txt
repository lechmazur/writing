<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (recluse fearing ships yet seeking wisdom) act in the practice scene, earning the closure realization of "harbor steady, error cherished" via prior micro-choices like closing eyes to feel weights. Internal voice specific and embodied without diagnostic labels. Flaw complicates choices without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to vision of "tears finally found a slow, safe ford," delivering CR closure where self-redefinition carries conceptual cost of embracing flaw. Orientation anchored early in wandering storefronts. One tightening via practice suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood table's "map of old river scars" and verb-labeled stacks constrain choices (e.g., journal between "undoing and arrival") and charge final "linted moons" image. Sensory details (paper/wool air, humming brass plate) selective via bookmender bias. Spatial choreography coherent through shelf-door-table.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth wisdom from backward binding) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to vision reversal narrowing self-view from fear to integration. Agency in writing note forecloses recluse path with cost ("must mend what happened"); price legible in "error cherished."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Paradox theme emerges via particulars like backward journal as "detour...bridge," resonant in final image reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in woman's "forward becomes kind only when it meets the backward halfway" implies via practice, not statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited perceptual signature (e.g., "lights that hummed like soft bees") biases toward bookish imagery; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Your mistake carries light"). Rhythmic control modulates from hush to widened quiet without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shelf of detergent swung inward to a hush older than the city" advances setting/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density in practice beat slightly muddles without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bookbinding as grief paradox in verb-stacks library transforms recluse trope organically. Risky lyric compression (e.g., "staying while leaving") heightens stakes toward CR without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
