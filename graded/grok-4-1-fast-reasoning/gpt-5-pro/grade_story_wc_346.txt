<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied contradictions like "bruised awe" and the ache shaped like a bell, compelling the ritual choice with visible cost in the slower fall; puppet backstory anchors motivation without flattening present pressure. Final adjustment earns reprieve through prior causality, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through rituals to Charged Poise closure: clock slows, lullaby scatters, with conceptual cost of mercy's "slower fall" legible in final image of welcoming beacon. Orientation instant; scope flawless single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Pane of hush, puppet, lens constrain listening and sequence choices, charging final forehead-to-pane coolness; selective sensory hierarchy (hush swallows sound, salt taste) mirrors POV urgency, evolving causally with dusk to starlight. 9+ test aced via recurrent objects in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lullaby reprieve) signaled early, tightens via nested sequence under textural lens, forcing endurance with agency in key-turns; cost unmistakable in "century unknots" and foreclosed endings, charging final ribbons of light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gentle endings emerges organically from ritual images, culminating in resonant non-literal answer: inward light as "warm tide washing clean," reweighting hush without moralizing. Particulars like puppet's smile avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in patterned diction ("nested patterns," "bruised awe") modulates rhythmically with ritual intensity; stable first-person focalization biases toward tides and scars, with purposeful compression paying off in closure poise. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (lens "blooms with quiet fire"); no loops, scaffold, or muddle—rhythm breathes with scene, ear-test flawless even in peak sequence. 9+ test: zero artifacts, propulsion peaks at key-turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Doomsday clock as lullaby ritual transforms apocalyptic trope via lighthouse mechanics and puppet witness, risking lyric compression that heightens stakes; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, with bold tone sustaining closure.</comment>
