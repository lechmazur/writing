<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear as "quiet animal" vs. deliberate work) act in scene, earning final endurance with bartered costs like "echo of laughter"; interiority particular and embodied throughout repairs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of repairs builds to Charged Poise closure where arches "stood proud" and planet phrase reconfigures from threat, with legible costs in memory tithes; orientation anchored early in orchards/arches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mines/shafts as "wind organs" constrain choices and charge final chorus; sensory details (cold iron scent, rubble clatter) selective via blacksmith bias, evolving with tremors to mirror internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax planetary resilience) tightens accumulatively through tremor complication and escalating tithes ("greater tithe"), forcing endurance with visible costs like thinned voice; agency in barters forecloses collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet making emerges from rubble-to-dovetail transformations; final image ("arches had heard that truth") offers resonant reweighting of defiance without moralizing, tying to initial anxious apples.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (stone "remembers," silk "translates stubbornness") with rhythmic control modulates from deliberate calm to tremor compression; stable first-person POV biases toward forge-root priorities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (e.g., "powder drift fell like white moths") taught early, no loops/artifacts dulling closure; varied rhythm propels from bell strike to dusk exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-bartered geology and lyric repairs transforms collapse trope; risk-taking in poetic world logic (arches "shouldering storms") heightens stakes organically to inevitable closure image.</comment>
