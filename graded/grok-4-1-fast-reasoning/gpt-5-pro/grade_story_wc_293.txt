<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—disbelief vs. sculpting possibility from 'never'—act simultaneously in the recount and following, earning the final faith with embodied cost in "canyon brighten inside me, a slow flipbook sensation." Fiddler and hitchhiker apply crucible pressure via music and explanation. Distinct voices in limited dialogue; flaws like habitual observation drive discovery without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (flake projections, scaffold flutters) builds to RR closure in cairn placement and heart's "hold and release," reweighting vanishing with pixelated amnesty at cost of prior disbelief. Orientation anchored in opening line. One tightening via flutters guides to crevice; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flake as micro-setting constrains path (projections reveal hitchhiker, cairn lenses sun to crevice), charging final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (glint in rosin, tar smell, gullies like faces). Details evolve causally (scaffold snaps path); spatial choreography clear from pullout to switchback.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve vanishing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via flake and flutters narrowing to crevice discovery; agency in following/placing flake forecloses doubt path. Cost legible in "relief refuses to believe itself" and flake left behind. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness via fragments emerges implicitly from flake's "pixelated amnesty" shifting vanishing to sideways step, resonating in final "bridge finding itself" without moralizing. Particulars (tattoos as chord, cairn lens) reweight premise; ambiguity in choice lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cataloging the glint in his rosin") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences at discovery). Stable single POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("what I would do if..."), advances via fiddler's prompt. No head-hopping; elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (long pours over ravine, short flips at bloom). Figurative density purposeful in lyric mode but borders overwrite in crevice beat ("pixelated amnesty blooming square by square"), docking slightly. No loops; clean syntax anchors images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fiddler's bridge-souls and flake as light-listener transform vanishing trope into textural quest, risking poetic density that heightens stakes. Irreplaceable flake/flutters inflections inevitable from setup; no derivatives.</comment>
