<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority shines in contradictory impulses—writing sincere letters for others while withholding his own heart—culminating in the public spiral as earned vulnerability. Final reunion choice forecloses private longing with relational cost on page. Backstory anchors tightly to present via damp letters and dust-season departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from damp letters to stranger-tied vows, tightening to woman's arrival and silent walk through spiral. On-page Charged Poise closure in "we tied our own silence to the twine" reconfigures private secrets publicly with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors immediately in temple approach; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>South colonnade balusters constrain spiral-building choice, pond mirrors internal states via ripples, nest/reeds charge final cosmos image. Sensory hierarchy (green light, dragonfly stitches, thrush song) reflects post-storm urgency and POV priorities. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks crowd drift to dusk warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rejoin via public art) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as spiral thickens with strangers' letters, woman's arrival narrows to silent walk. Agency in anchoring twine/letters forces trade-off of privacy for connection; cost legible in "peeled away my composure" echoing to shared hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of public secrets reconnecting emerges organically from letter spiral mirroring lost love; nest/ribbon shift from endurance to "small cosmos" offers non-literal answer reweighting private pain. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "thread that connects all things" via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (e.g., "nest spins... auditioning to become a diagram") biases toward geometric longing; rhythmic modulation builds from prismatic quiet to fluttering fins. Keeper's sparse dialogue carries subtext; no head-hopping, stable intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines like "ribbon glows like a secret that wants to be kept and told" advance image/character/pressure without loops or scaffolds. Rhythmic variety (short dusk beats to warm stone hush) propels; no figurative muddle, read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghostwriter's public spiral transforms secret-keeping trope into communal reunion geometry, risking lyrical compression that heightens stakes via irreplaceable nest/ribbon. No derivative echoes; bold public vulnerability from private craft inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
