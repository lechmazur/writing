<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bell tuner's infinite patience embodied in guiding the stamping boy ("raised his hand and waited"), compelling narrator's arc to commitment ("I promised to keep time"). Contradictory impulses surface in boy's hard stamp versus required gentleness. Final renunciation of ruling for listening earned via prior shared steps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from fork's hum to collective footsteps, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("steps still trembled in the stones") with conceptual cost of ongoing patience over quick fixes. Orientation anchored early (dusk arrival at archway). One tightening via boy's crack settles into harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain walking rhythm, charging final image ("our steps still trembled in the stones"). Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (smoke-dark hum in bones, heels' downbeat). Atmosphere's wild hush mirrors internal alignment, evolving with mortar's sigh.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rhythmic revival vs. collapse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via group circling and boy's disruptive stamp narrowing to gentler cadence. Agency in tuner/narrator micro-adjustments; cost legible in crack's leap then settlement. Subtle but coherent pressure forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared rhythm over speeches emerges via particulars (footsteps braiding thunder, bells waking under feet), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Boy's flaw tests balance's fragility. Resonance from earned ambiguity of patient tide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with perceptual signature (hums breathing, air as loom) stable and biased toward sonic rhythm. Compression taught early, pays off in closure's trembling steps. Tuner dialogue sparse, subtextual, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern ("wild hush," fork as black gull) taught early, propelling via varied rhythm without loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors risks coherence but serves lyric accumulative drive. Propulsion aligns with scene's steady build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tuning fork and footsteps transforms ghost town revival into rhythmic restoration, risking bold lyric structure that heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration ("balance is... a chorus of feet") inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
