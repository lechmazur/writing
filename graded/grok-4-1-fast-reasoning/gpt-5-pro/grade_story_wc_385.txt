<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional single-POV interiority with embodied sound-perception and contradictory impulses in singing against council fear; final renunciation of shell earned by progressive causal build. Richly perceptive trait enables micro-choices like tuning to tremor, revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of song layers/descent/revelations builds to CR closure where shell reunites voice with conceptual cost to echo commerce, legible in "walls glittered with returning names." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via nexus convergence suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (sound primacy) constrains choices like "song learned to crawl" in metallic air; nexus tongue/serpentine coils charge final image of left shell in sunlight. Vivid, selective integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn echo mechanics) signaled early, tightens via shell deepening knowledge/council reveal; agency in singing ensures returns forecloses commerce path with legible cost in fleeing figures. Lens escalation: density reweights to harmony refusing unquestioned return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from voice-debt particulars to resonant CR: "harmony refuses to return unquestioned" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image of lighter melancholy answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-biased diction/rhythm modulates with pressure; stable first-person POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at shell pour-off. Sparse dialogue carries caution subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density/propulsion with varied syntax mirroring reed-blown cadence; purposeful metaphors cohere (e.g., "rivers braid silt") without muddle in peak nexus beat. Zero loops/scaffold; read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-market mythos transforms folklore tropes via voice-commerce logic; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in nexus unraveling, inevitable in hindsight with irreplaceable perceptual angle.</comment>
