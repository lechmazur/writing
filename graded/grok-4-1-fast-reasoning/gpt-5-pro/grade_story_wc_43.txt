<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Therapist's decisively kind practice shines in micro-choices like dialing Lena twice and using shard as pick, earning relational mend with embodied cost. Ruth and Lena's flaws (sharp memory, regret) drive inevitable reunion under death's pressure. Contradictory impulses act in scene, culminating in earned final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: blood work → rooftop → call → singing → goodbye crystallizes charged poise closure with shard's final press silencing chord, felt relational cost undeniable. Single scene causality tight, orientation anchored early in ward details. No orientation debt; pattern pays off at rooftop reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rooftop "fog laps below the rail" and shard "small black moon" constrain choices (haven enables reunion, vinyl picks strings), charging final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: oxygen hums to orange rind scents mirror emotional shifts. Micro-setting (blanket, guitar) tethers all.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunify for flawless goodbye) signaled early post-blood work, escalates accumulatively via call, song, practice narrowing to chord silence with relational cost. Agency in therapist's hymns forces stance crystallization. Cost unmistakable in "gentle as the heel of a sleeping hand."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending ordinary brokenness emerges via shard-songs, reweighted in repaired circle without moralizing. Final image ("light makes kind work of their faces") answers central question resonantly, charging prior motifs. Subtext in silences and implications lingers complexly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("hymning the mundane," "pulsing stillness") modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable single POV. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Sister, I am here"). Experimental poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels: lines multi-task image/pressure (e.g., "scent of hope rises from the blanket"). Minor metaphor density in peak ("shard flashes") purposeful but borders overwrite; no loops, clean rhythm. Zero scaffold obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard-as-pick transforms hospice trope into precise, ingenious goodbye; rooftop vinyl-hymn synthesis feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes via "broken things singing." Non-obvious emotional calculus on sharpness elevates.</comment>
