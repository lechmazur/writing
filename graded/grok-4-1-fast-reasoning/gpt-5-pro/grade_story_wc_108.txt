<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's phobia-ridden interiority shines in embodied shakes and fear-mapping that propel micro-choices; final aid to Kellan crystallizes adaptive vulnerability as power with relational cost, earning the renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from cast decryption to projector reveal and trapdoor lunge delivers on-page Charged Poise closure; cost legible in shared ruin and "honest beginning" as Kellan falls through avoided rotten boards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rusted library's rotten boards and skylight stars constrain climax choices, mirroring adaptive fear; seashell and projector integrate tactilely, charging final film-reflower image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to outwit via vulnerability tightens causally through call, reveal, and trap; agency forecloses Kellan's power with visible cost in his fall and mutual exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal reconfigures as "vulnerability is power" through seashell cipher and final shared watching; resonant ending image of steady voice answers composite-truth question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with perceptual bias (shaking as rehearsal mark) holds under pressure; sparse dialogue carries subtext in Kellan's "you never would have been Jax" retort.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dense, purposeful metaphors (breath arguing, rust constellations) propel rhythmically; minor overwriting in sustained figurative layering during confrontation dings propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Child's cast-seashell cipher for stunt-identity theft transforms betrayal trope ingeniously; trapdoor outwit from phobia-mapping feels inevitable and risks bold poetic compression.</comment>
