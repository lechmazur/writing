<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ruan's motivation to illuminate assumptions via rhetoric drives consistent micro-choices like looping inhales and targeted questions, earning the entity's faltering; contradictory impulses shine in the voice's "flat plane" vs. Ruan's prying "who makes the horizon." Mara's embodied thinning voice and uncoached breath add particularity. Final renunciation costs the entity its throne-like hunger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of loops and questions to RR closure: "the demon recognized its hunger as a door, not a throne, and loosened," with cost in thinning blue and incomplete possession. Orientation anchored early in chapel/Ruan/Mara. Lens holds cleanly without ambiguity; constraint of loops shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chapel as dimensional anchor constrains by "leaning its shoulder" and steadying weight, charging final "hush clearing like a lake at daybreak." Sensory hierarchy (hush purring blue, wind of receipts/rain) filters through Ruan's care, selective and vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent possession via rhetoric before completion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through question-tightenings like "If you own everything, what will you ask tomorrow," forcing entity pause and recognition with agency in Ruan's chiasmus/antithesis. Cost unmistakable in palette drop and uncoached breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of questions as commons vs. possessive flatness emerges organically from rhetorical exchanges, resonating in non-literal closure: "possession cannot complete where questions are a commons." Final image reweights prior loops/silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited focalization through Ruan's perceptual signature (thumb over vellum care, grammar sliding footholds) with rhythmic modulation under pressure. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven: entity's declarative flatness vs. Ruan's intoned anaphora distinguishes voices cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload in peak beats ("blue skittered," "grammar slide its footholds") borders coherence without muddle; minor strain dulls select lines. Zero loops/scaffold; rhythm varies with intentional anaphora. Varied syntax supports hush-to-clear cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Loop-pedal priest wielding rhetoric in dimensional-anchor chapel transforms exorcism trope into fresh rhetorical duel; risk of poetic compression pays off in Accumulative closure. Synthesis of silence-decoration and blue-hunger feels inevitable and bold.</comment>
