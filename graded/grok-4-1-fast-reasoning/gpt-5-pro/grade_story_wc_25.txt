<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's specific trait of reading footsteps and maintenance habits drive micro-choices like vent adjustments, earning the closure proof; motivation rooted in mother's lesson intensifies via storm pressure without internal contradiction. Otero applies sharp secondary pressure through wager. Final distribution of oranges reveals values hierarchy with quiet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whisper tactics builds to RR closure in courier's arrival and steel retaining the whisper, with felt storm cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Containers as micro-setting constrain and enable whisper propagation ("corrugated steel funneled breath"), charging final image of steel keeping whisper; sensory hierarchy (sounds over visuals) reflects POV expertise. Storm evolves causally, mirroring internal patience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide via whispers before dawn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pitch adjustments and map refolds narrowing options; agency in hearing "tiny thank you" forces gate opening with patience cost legible in charged air. Protagonist alteration proves gentleness under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of whispers enrolling surfaces emerges organically from failed shouts vs. successful vents; Gemini coin reprise reweights twins/voices duality without statement until earned post-closure line, which slightly tells but integrates via oranges. Resonant final image avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (footsteps lean/pause, metal moods) biases noticing; rhythmic compression modulates with storm intensity, stable first-person. Sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven (Otero's bellow vs. narrator's thread of voice).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "zodiac coin, scored with tiny stars and oily"); figurative pattern (sound as rider/river) taught early, coherent in peak beats without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or drift; propulsion matches scene rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound physics in container maze with aurora storm transforms whisper/shout trope; risk in lyric acoustics heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via mother's iron-listening legacy. No derivative echoes.</comment>
