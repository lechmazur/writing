<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in unlearning the "respectable tremor" to signal rebellion, earning the final pocketed shell as future tool with inspector cost; embodied via heartbeat tuning and locust cupped palm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure ("the new silence took root"); orientation anchored by ~100 words (sky-bridge, orchard); cost legible in "tomorrow... inspectors" foreclosing easy return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via statues' tracking "eyelids that clicked" forcing hushed play, charges final ring with "joints blooming shy moss"; selective senses (fog stitching, granite veins) filter through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) deepens accumulatively as statues swivel to signal back, narrowing to consonance; agency in "thumped the request," cost in loosened knots risking city response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of tarnished wonder emerges via orchard's settling "like a field deciding wind," reweighting mechanical control without statement; final "heart to lead" resonates prior images non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "count measures by the scatter of sparrows"; rhythmic modulation peaks at "rails rose... earth breathed," stable single POV with lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("levers complained;... stamp stalled"); minor metaphor density in peak ("groan like pages") risks slight overwrite but pattern-consistent; no loops, varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin signaling heart rhythms to free policed orchard transforms steampunk tropes; risk in poetic prose heightens stakes, inevitable "tarnished wonder" from particulars.</comment>
