<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anya's methodical hope manifests in concrete micro-choices like painting glyphs and ledger-keeping, with contradictory endurance against the smoggy city; visitors' recognitions force value-revealing actions. Final palm glyph earns her renunciation of despair with embodied cost in persistent tending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visitor proofs tighten solitary painting into practiced faith. Charged Poise closure in palm glyph reconfigures hope as pulsing vow, cost legible in "keep faith" amid city mutter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlight pooling in bristles and path across floor constrain daydream rousing and charge final glyph. Greenhouse terracotta and smeared neon filter through Anya's hopeful bias, evolving with vents inviting pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving kindness—deepens accumulatively via ledger of gifts, narrowing doubt with micro-costs like thyme coins. Escalation coherent under textural lens, though single tightening subtle; agency in brush-tending forecloses isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kindness via lost languages emerges organically; final glyph offers non-literal answer, reweighting fragments into breathing practice without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like saffron and gloves avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("vowels traded for bread") modulates rhythmically; stable single POV, no leakage. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in "Welcome" whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; coherent metaphors like "lantern wrapped in tea cloth" propel without muddle. No loops; purposeful lyric figs enhance textural drive to closure glyph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moon-tipped brush rousing lost alphabets transforms magic trope into inevitable kindness proofs; risk-taking in textural accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
