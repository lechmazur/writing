<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of rapture and shadowed cost act vividly in freeing the fledglings; final renunciation earned by causal build, with "thin line of cold remained inside me" embodying felt price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density tightens from instrument awakening to sparks/syllables, yielding Charged Poise closure in promised vigilance; cost legible in "thin line of cold" and instrument's chill.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and instrument constrain choices (tracing stars, combing night) and charge final image of resting brass; sensory filter (ink/comet tails) biases via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through star-tracing to syllable-sparks reversal narrowing options; agency in unlocking yields on-page cost of internal cold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of freeing ideas from fear emerges organically via fledglings' wax-sealed beaks to patient return; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, embracing shadowed complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical signature in star-dust perceptual bias modulates rhythm with pressure (short sparks sentences amid longer arcs); stable close-third POV, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; minor metaphor density in peak freeing ("sparks were... syllables, remembered stardust stitching") risks overload but stays coherent/pattern-taught; no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh premise fuses astronomy with stifled creativity via stardust mechanics; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, synthesizing to inevitable "patient feet" return.</comment>
