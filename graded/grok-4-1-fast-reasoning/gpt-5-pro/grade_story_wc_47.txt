<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in reluctance to speak publicly ("old reluctance lift then settle") earned by grafting actions; interiority particular and embodied throughout, with Miri applying gentle crucible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building patterns (drip to moss mapping) to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "fear without breaking its stem," reconfiguring public bravery into private practice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via drip-guided paths and rack-grafting, charging final pendant image; sensory hierarchy (honeyed hush on skin, moss breath) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting wounds) deepens accumulatively through visitor exchange, narrowing to endurance over publicity; cost felt in stem-breaking risk, agency in micro-choices like proffering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing emerges organically from particulars (pendant bribe to metronome), resonant non-literal close in "hush so honeyed the lens cannot manufacture it" reweights confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measuring storms by their shadows") rhythmic under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, stable first-person with lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative coherence (velvet greens, glistening grammar) pattern-taught, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data center as mossed reckoning space transforms confession trope; risk-taking in lyric voice heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via drip-to-harvest arc.</comment>
