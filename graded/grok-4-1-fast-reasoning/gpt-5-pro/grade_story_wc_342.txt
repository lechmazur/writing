<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority ties face blindness to motivation via "I never saw my father's face after the accident; it became a blank noon," earning the endurance of giving the building "a face I can know" with personal cost; contradictory impulses in "craft and my curse, my solace and my compass" act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from safe discovery to painting, landing CR closure in "The library is no longer a room but a portrait of days before faces," with cost legible in demolition hush and unsaved building; oriented early, no waiver needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tree trunk library and coin constrain choices (e.g., "coordinates hidden in the recursive coils" guide strokes) and charge final image; sensory details like "wood, warm despite the cold" evolve tactilely through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish sky-portrait before demolition) signaled early tightens via coin-map deepening, forcing trade-off in "quicken without hurriedness" as siren tests; cost felt in foreclosed haste, agency in painting pulses with wall's limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sky/limits emerges organically from coin's "wandering stars" to final "horizon where none is expected," reweighting faces/rooms without moralizing; child's drawing subtly charges backstory without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ceilings breathe," "gray that lives in breath before thunder") biases noticing toward boundaries/weather; stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically under closing pressure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short "Siren tests its throat" amid longer lyric lines); high density in graphite rubbing beat, but minor figurative density ("dust blooms like night") risks slight overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's coin-map sky in doomed tree-library synthesizes fresh premise organically; risk of lyric compression heightens stakes, transforming tropes into inevitable "room births itself" reconfiguration.</comment>
