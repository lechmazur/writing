<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete, poetic embodiment ("sew grief into nets," "hauntingly optimistic" shown in hearing "openings sing"); contradictory optimism amid fracture drives micro-choices like sewing seam with tender reversal; earned change in emergence with town's shy hope as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chalk paths to sewn seam ("stone parts with shy gratitude") to chamber tremor, culminating in RR/CR closure where lighthouse shines inward along walls, reconfiguring ruin to reverence with conceptual cost of tuning broken precedents.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (salt/ochre hush, wind's "cool palm," stone tremor like "heart deciding to trust") filters through POV's poetic bias; labyrinth constrains choices (niche fit, grooves for pages), charging final orchid bloom across stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carve path from ruin to reverence) signaled early, tightens texturally via payment of attention at fork to tremor resolution; agency in sewing/listening forecloses rigid rules, with legible cost in "shame gratitude of a child waking without a cry."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of broken precedents as tunable instruments emerges organically from particulars (cracked rules, sewn seam, rough book); resonant CR in "lighthouse without a lamp" promise and final "palms learn them," reweighting premise without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("each corridor sings a note," "orchid solace unfolding"); rhythmic syntax modulates with intensity, stable single POV; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at shine closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied openings, purposeful rhythm); minor figurative density in peak seam-sewing ("river of pitch and linen") but pattern-taught without muddle; no loops, clean syntax supports choir-like cadence to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms labyrinth quest via poetic weaver sewing sleepwalk paths and lightless lighthouse into inward shine; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from "nets that float" to "new song needs every quiet shard."</comment>
