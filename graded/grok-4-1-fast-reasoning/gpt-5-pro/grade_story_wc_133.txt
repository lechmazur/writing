<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solitary hunger vs. communal painting) act simultaneously in the exchange and mural beats; final renunciation of "nothing" for brooch earned by prior micro-choices like following the brooch. Interiority concrete and embodied ("ribs ring like struck brass," "eyes burned with haggard awe"). Mara applies crucible pressure via story-for-place deal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from brooch discovery to map haul-up to mural, culminating in Charged Poise RR where rain on painted lines reconfigures island's flood relation with communal cost (scaffolds, shaking hands). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (tidal island, painter post-wars). No lens ambiguity; persistent brooch constraint shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal mud, eelgrass, causeway gutters, chapel cistern constrain path and choices (brooch aligns with runnels; low tide reveals, high tide enables songs). Final image of rain on mural charged by chapel wall micro-setting. Sensory selection POV-biased (painterly: "feral fresco," "ochres ground from brick").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh meaning via work) signaled early, tightens accumulatively: brooch narrows to rain trails, map deepens to communal braid, forcing endurance trade-off (insomnia yields to children's chatter measuring hours). Cost legible in "hands shook with old nights" during peak mural. Agency in following/exchanging; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of meaning threshed from tidal experience emerges via brooch-map-mural braid; final image ("rain crept down the painted lines... teaching us") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting natural convergence over machines, with counter-reading in haggard awe's cost. Subtext in Mara's laugh and brooch return avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct painterly perceptual signature ("tide slid back like a tired lung," "circles that met like raindrops colliding") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from wry opening to compressed awe at cistern ("seam of light rose... uncoiling"). Dialogue subtextual and idiomatic (Mara's "Do not dress it up"); stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "I turned the brooch... a thin drip led inland again" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm/read-aloud propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught (rain threads/ribbons/current), coherent without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-wars rain cartography and painterly convergence transforms eco-tropes via brooch geometry and tidal braid; risk-taking in accumulative lyric progression heightens stakes (hunger vs. flood memory) without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight: brooch-map-mural arc organic to premise.</comment>
