<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scholar's reticence contrasts stubbornly with actions like humming into crystal and testifying, earning the climax choice; interiority concrete via "pang at the word court" and embodied in tracing ivy. Minor abstraction in emotions like "weathered innocence" slightly distances peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via echo density building to CR closure ("library becomes a garden of ears"), with cost in testimony risk and custodians' lowered eyes; orientation anchors in first line, single scene coherent. No orientation debt; persistent crystal constraint shapes final return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library shadows, beams/plaster, ivy constrain echo mapping and testimony staging; recurring crystal as micro-setting charges closure reprise. Sensory hierarchy (sonic over visual) biases via scholar's ear for growth; evolves from dawn hush to noon sharpening without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove silent growth) signaled early, textural escalation via echo shards to testimony tightening; agency in crystal use forecloses doubt with custodians' reaction as felt cost. Minor abstractness softens visceral price at "wooden coin" summons.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of uncorralled cultural growth emerges via echo/ivy particulars, reweighted in CR ending image without moralizing; subtext in "authority is a blunt instrument" braids silence as garden. Final "pocket of patient rain" resonates non-literally, charging prior hush motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via sonic bias ("meadow of replies"); syntax/rhythm modulate from hushed expansion to testimony compression. No head-hopping; purposeful elision of dictionary era taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("suspended hush") propels textural lens; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops obscuring closure. Dense figuratives ("whisper dressed in its own echo") cohere without muddle, though minor paraphrase in growth patterns ("pauses and leaps") touches non-peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sonic crystal decodes silence growth post-dictionary fresh angle on language evolution; risk in lyric mosaic of shards heightens stakes to testimony poise. Inevitable hindsight synthesis of hush/crystal/ivy transforms library trope organically.</comment>
