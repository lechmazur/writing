<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hope guarded via "wistfully pragmatic" while hands act patiently) act in scene; final endurance of shared vulnerability earned by lock-picking micro-choice and net adjustment, with cost in "protect my hope so it can stay."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from petal drop to light river in stairwell; Charged Poise closure in final rosebush touch reconfigures hush to harbor with conceptual cost ("tooth will rust someday, but tonight...").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight and tar roof constrain choices (light source, anchor net); recurring rosebush and tooth charge final image ("thorns shine... stitches that hold").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to instill light tightens texturally as padlock yields and Theo steps into spill, forcing trade-off of guarded hope; agency in patient oar-rhythm motions forecloses isolation with felt relational cost in residents' responses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of hush becoming harbor offers non-literal answer to instilling steadiness, reweighting vulnerability without moral; emerges organically from light-gentling actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (hush as fog listening, light as milk/river) and rhythmic control (oar repetitions modulate tension) under pressure; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual (Alvarez exchange polishes bannister).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphor pattern (light/river/hush consistent, no muddle); propulsion varies rhythm without loops, peaking in "light finds the mouth, slides down."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardener's mirror-net and gauge-tooth lockpick transforms light-sharing trope; risk-taking lyric compression inevitable in hindsight via harbor callbacks heightening stakes.</comment>
