<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the "laugh betrays me, coming early" pulse that risks drawing the gyre closer yet enables steering, earned through family-taught laughter as oil; final logbook entry marks visible endurance cost, feeling "older and lighter."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from instruments' invitation to gyre pivot and beam braiding; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly in "We do not drown; we drink," reweighting storm-reader premise with town/polllen cost felt in shaking lighthouse and parched fields nourished.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass wick and spiraled glass constrain choices (unspool in brine, trace fractures); recurring ozone/library paste charges final logbook image, sensory hierarchy (fog/salt hands, wind-tugged coat) mirrors POV priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to guide gyre tightens via laugh betrayal narrowing options to wick-rune intervention; agency in tuned laugh and wheel-turn forecloses drowning path with legible cost in "docks groan, roofs rattle," reweighting under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of storms/readers hooked by joy-light stories emerges organically from clippings-shadows mapping beam to gyre; final "gyre leans back...scattering pollen" offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting post-newspaper rituals without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in physics-tide fusion ("bending it through total internal reflection") and rhythmic modulation (short peak sentences amid lyric flow) heighten pressure; stable first-person POV with no leakage, elisions (grandmother stories) anchor present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "I go to the lamp and unspool...scratching runes" advances action/character); minor overwrite in peak gyre-braiding metaphors risks coherence but pattern-taught from outset holds propulsion to closure without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse physics-magic hybrid transforms tropes via newspaper-shadow beam steering storm as reader; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from prophetic laugh seed.</comment>
