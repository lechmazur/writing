<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied senses (palms to trembling panes, pulse swallowed by shard); contradictory impulses in bearing the gap while aligning echoes drive micro-choices. Final endurance earned by prior struggle with prism's scars. Minor slip: overt articulation of proof in closing lines borders diagnostic, but embodied in thistle-hope image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard-fitting to retro-alignment, culminating in Charged Poise RR as beam replies to flare with felt cost of halted wheel and survived alignments. Orientation anchored early (Kera as custodian, post-collapse ruins). Closure cost legible in "halted, snagged on years" and re-inhale rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (humming glass, salt nettles, star halos) filters through Kera's retrocognitive bias, constraining climb and calibration. Pavilion recurs to charge final hum toward landfall. Micro-setting (prism cradle, copper thread) shapes pivotal mending beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend to prove meaning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via beam's shimmer-failure and retro-deepening that narrows to old rhythm. Agency in wheel-turns forecloses forgetting with on-page cost (gap borne, cautious heart-leap). Escalation coheres under lens, charging flare-cadence reply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coincidences braiding purpose emerges organically from shard-trade, star-paths, and flare-answer; final rope-image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and echoes invites ambiguity on meaning's proof.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (notes as constellations, time as shallow water) stable in close third; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure (groaned wheel to flexed beam). Purposeful lyric compression taught early via pavilion song, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-task (e.g., "wheel halted, snagged on years" advances cause/emotion). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative coherence (whale-engine, river-braid) pattern-taught without muddle in peak beam-flex.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse lyricism with retrocognition and hush-shard transforms beacon trope; thistle-hope inflection risks bold tone-shift that heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from boy-trade to flare-nod.</comment>
