<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via poetic embodiment like "heart is a coastline rewritten by storms"; micro-choices (tying thread, projecting, writing own obit) reveal values under pressure. Final endurance to stay earned by causal buildup. Minor abstract diagnostic slips in motivation phrasing slightly dilute embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density tightens from thread/projection to seeds/shoots stitching map. On-page CR closure ("absence grows intimate with mercy") reconfigures healing premise with conceptual cost of migration. Orientation anchored early in garden/quay; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shadowed autumn garden, thread, fog-beaded galley constrain choices (tether for projection, planting site) and charge final image (shoots curling around thread). Sensory selection (bronze leaves scissoring, salt fog) POV-biased and purposeful. Micro-setting evolves causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping healing geography) signaled early, deepens via Mira's request/projection/letter into cadence shift at seeds. Agency in endurance/staying forecloses return path with felt relational cost (husband's non-return). Minor abstractness in stakes legibility prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing as migration emerges organically from thread-seeds image arc, reweighting absences without moralizing. Final shoots as "green handwriting" offers non-literal resonance to central question. No tidy binaries; complexity in "staying does not halt travel."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lyric diction ("gulls sound like hinges," "knives breathe iron"); consistent first-person stability, no leakage. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Mira's request evokes ache). Rhythmic control modulates pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.5</comment><grade>Purposeful lyric density propels via varied syntax/rhythm; no loops, high info per line (e.g., "leaves scissor down, bronze on slate"). Minor figural density borders overwriting in projection beat but coherent/voice-motivated. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obit-writing via "projecting presence" transforms grief tropes into map-stitching arc. Thread as evolving conduit risks bold lyric structure heightening stakes organically. No derivatives; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
