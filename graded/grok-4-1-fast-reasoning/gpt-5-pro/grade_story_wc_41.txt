<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Precognitively forgetful trait drives micro-choices like chalking self-instructions obeyed later, earning final obedience to future self with embodied cost in evaporating knowledge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as marking/recording patterns densify to amphitheater CR closure; wave shifting arrows delivers legible cost in "knowledge evaporating before the forgetting even arrived."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and sculptures constrain choices (erasure prompts markers) and charge final "tape bloomed with gray light"; sensory hierarchy (sounds over visuals) reflects prophet's auditory stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture aging's sound tightens via fogged paths and wave complication, forcing endurance; cost unmistakable in shifted arrows and premature loss foreclosing perfect capture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of aging as "leaving without stopping" emerges organically from tape/echo images, resonant CR in final harbor hearing reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sounds as tides/echoes) and rhythmic modulation under fog pressure; stable single POV with purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, no loops; minor simile density in peak recording beat purposeful for textural lens, but slight repetition of driftwood phrasing nudges from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of junkyard prophet and fog garden transforms aging trope via auditory capture; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable CR harbor image.</comment>
