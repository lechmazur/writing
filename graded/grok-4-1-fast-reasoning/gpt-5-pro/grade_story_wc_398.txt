<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentinel’s renunciation via burned letter earns nurturing role, shown in embodied thumb stain and micro-choices like soil libation; traveler’s confession to call traces credible arc under pressure. Minor abstraction in “intersubjective understanding” avoids peak deduction as dramatized via parallels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from confession to letter share to call, closure as Charged Poise in traveler folding letter and leaving with “new breath,” cost legible in libation “oath to listen” and sentinel’s solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (gravel scuff, soil scent rising “spicy”) constrains choices (pouring site, road approach) and charges final vines “lodge small claims”; recurring pavilion evolves with lamp extinguish.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mismatch) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via parallels and letter to call agency; cost visible in “weight bends their bridge” and soil pour foreclosing silence hoard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mismatches theme emerges organically via pruning/trellis metaphors, resonant non-literal close in “storms can become music” reweighting destiny without moralizing; ambiguity in celebration lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (“breeze that changes a cluster’s mind”) consistent in first-person, dialogue subtextual (“Try spending them”) advances with distinct idioms; rhythm modulates to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vineyard-patterned figurative language taught early, varied rhythm propels; minor template cadence in persuasion motifs (“persuades,” “persuasive”) touches non-closure beats only (−0.4 non-closure cap).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentinel as metaphor-weaver transforms advice trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens quiet closure without gimmick.</comment>
