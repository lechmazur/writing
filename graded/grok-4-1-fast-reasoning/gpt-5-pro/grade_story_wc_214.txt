<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief-broken ribs driving job for "light" lifting) act in scene; final teaching of crew is earned via prior vulnerability-sharing, with cost in exposing "soft belly."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mop to meteor rush; RR closure ("they canceled the dismantling") lands on-page with cost (deadline foreclosed, season granted).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station antennas ("patient vertebrae") and lantern glass constrain choices (mopping rails, passing glass) and charge final image of breathing sky; selective sensory bias fits janitor's perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (station endurance via care) signaled early; textural escalation peaks in "surge" rush forcing crew's stance crystallization, with agency/cost in tracing persuasion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-strength emerges organically via ribs/maps; final "breathe with the sky" reconfigures prior surrender-patterns without moralizing, reweighting "flourishing stillness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (cosmos in grit) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens from hush to thrum under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in crew exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (stars/breath); no loops/scaffold dull closure, though metaphor density risks slight overwrites mid-beats but pays off accumulatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor premise synthesizes neglect/science/care into fresh frame; risk of lyric compression heightens stakes, with lantern/maps as inevitable charged turns.</comment>
