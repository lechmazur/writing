<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to reclaim courage post-leash break drives micro-choices like kneeling and humming, with contradictory fear/patience embodied in "breathe smaller so as not to scatter" pawprints; guides apply pressure through teaching; earned change in dog's return and leash-free walk seals internal arc without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (stars, pawprints, lullaby) builds to Charged Poise closure in dog's shoulder press and star-lit descent, reconfiguring panic into patient welcome; cost legible in "panic tramples tracks, while quiet lets them rise"; orientation anchored early in ferry inlet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and cliff stair constrain indirect arcs and vigil patience, charging final "stars on my card cool like shells"; sensory hierarchy (conch-hum, bruise twilight) filters through protagonist's tidal perception, evolving causally with fog and night.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover dog via courage) signaled in guides' dialogue tightens accumulatively through fox shadow and pawprints reversal, narrowing chase to welcome; agency in humming lullaby forecloses pursuit with cost of "thorn-crowned and trembling" wait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patience over force emerges organically from indirect routes and vigil, reweighted in final leash-free walk without moralizing; subtext in star lanterns and shed snake skin charges counter-reading of loss as renaming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice ("sea sigh turning inside my ribs") with tidal perceptual bias stable in single POV; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("panic tramples tracks"); rhythm modulates from ascent tension to closure poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful patterns ("indirect routes") propels via varied rhythm, but minor metaphor density in ridgeway beats ("braid of heath and wind with veils") risks slight overwriting without obscuring fox/pawprint turn or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mythic ferry quest transforms lost-dog trope via star stamps and twilight vigil into fresh synthesis of courage as gentle arcs; risk-taking in lyric compression inevitable in hindsight at dog's sniff of constellations.</comment>
