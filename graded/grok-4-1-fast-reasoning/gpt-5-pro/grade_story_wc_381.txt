<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation roots in humility, embodied in micro-choices like "cupped his hands over the flow without touching," earning the final renunciation to "keep watch"; contradictory impulses (avoid prying yet alter flow) act simultaneously without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to Charged Poise closure at "terrestrially cosmic click," reconfiguring prophecy with conceptual cost of sealed meanings; orientation anchors early, one tightening via wing-turn suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Brook and reeds constrain tactics (grid on water, naming intervals), charging final "gentled current"; sensory hierarchy (gaps in cricket/frog songs) reflects summoner's priorities, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early tightens texturally when "syllable rose like mist" meets "hush received it"; agency in turning wing forecloses completion with ongoing vigilance cost legible in resolved watch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of patient silence over impatient answers emerges via particulars like heron lifting "as if agreeing"; final image of ordinary haven reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of unsearched doors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "faint creases formed a star map of earthly silences"; rhythmic modulation heightens hush density, purposeful elision of prophecy details paid off in reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: no loops, metaphors cohere (velvet hush to cool gold cauterize); varied rhythm in peak "turned it once, so the reflected stars changed their lanes" avoids overwriting via pattern-taught lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms summoning trope via origami silence-map against coded prophecy; risk-taking in paradox ("terrestrially cosmic") heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
