<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Heartbroken reaper's interiority concrete and particular, with embodied grief ("ribs vibrate when grief leans in"); motivation to name fears drives micro-choices like hesitating on "Not Leaving"; final naming of own fear "Enough" earns change with visible cost of shared heartbreak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tape density builds naming pattern to Charged Poise closure; folding atlas with "lexicon burning" reconfigures fears with felt cost of responsibility; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory's dome, prism, and dusk light constrain choices (tilting prism swarms dust); atlas page as micro-setting charges beasts' naming; sensory details POV-filtered (cold stone echoes breaths), evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of naming fears signaled early, accumulates via tapes to deepening of own fear; agency in unspooling, writing names forecloses fog with cost ("echo of sacrifice...held me responsible"); lens-consistent tightening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming to thin fog emerges organically from naming beasts then self; final "lexicon burning" offers resonant reconfiguration without moral; subtext in promises/beasts invites ambiguity on sacrifice's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in grief-tinged metaphors ("frost on eyelids"); first-person stable, rhythmic modulation heightens intimacy (short sentences in playback beats); no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (mica dust crystallizing) taught early, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion, peak clarity in "named it Enough"; minor vehicle density coherent under voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper myth with audio-projection naming beasts transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable to "lexicon burning"; particular details like "dog-headed fish" anchor originality.</comment>
