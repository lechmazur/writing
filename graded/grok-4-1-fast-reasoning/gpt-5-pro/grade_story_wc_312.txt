<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nera's contradictory impulses (guild rejection vs. naive belief) act in scene via drop-counting under doubt; final endurance of leaving bell earned by "old rules crumble," revealing flaw-value hierarchy with patience cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from drop observation to aligned ringing; Charged Poise closure in "seam stitches" and rising shapes reconfigures cosmic absence with undeniable patience cost on "pendulum of patience."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's weeping seam and slag-glass dawn light constrain bell-tuning choice and charge final "arch weeps" image; selective sensory hierarchy (drops over horizon) mirrors Nera's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of imbalance signaled early tightens accumulatively via drip-sync deepening to ringing reversal; agency in clapper drop forecloses hasty fix, cost legible in Aro's "empty and full" hands and no-cast season.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lukewarm sufficiency emerges from particulars like "tepid feels like the one temperature water never resists"; final bell image non-literally reweights "failure" premise with small-scale resonance, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in drop-as-metronome bias sustains close third POV; dialogue subtext (Aro's "shrine to failure") pursues goals, voice modulates rhythmically under rising hum pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in counting beats; coherent metaphors (drops as "second arguing with gravity") taught early avoid muddle, no loops dulling "note travels like fog" climax clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious "wet arithmetic" magic synthesizes fisher lore and cosmic fix; lyric risk of drip-pattern heightens stakes, transforming tropes into inevitable "small... clapper" closure without gimmick.</comment>
