<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization excels in tutor-narrator dynamic forcing gentle micro-choices like speaking a truth to the building, revealing narrator's growth; interiority embodied via "faint comic ache in my molars." Minor slip: tutor's revelation feels elegantly omitted but lacks one contradictory impulse under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; single rooftop scene orients by ~50 words, builds to CR closure in promise and "seal's impression cooling on my wrist" with conceptual cost of ongoing commitment. No orientation debt; pattern taught early via sealing demo pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting charges closure: rooftop garden "exhaled," meteors as "punctuation lesson" constrain timing and mirror linguistic theme, filtering through narrator's perceptual bias. Recurrent basil, tiles tactile and lived-in, evolving with stamps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning buildings' language) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via speaking back—"my apartment pretends to be temporary"—forcing renunciation of isolation with felt relational cost in building's sigh and promise. Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "agreed upon lies" emerges organically from seal demos and final "truths... dressed as the gentlest lies," reweighting premise without statement; resonant CR in wrist impression ties particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (buildings as grammar/vowels) biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, dialogue subtextual ("Do not rush"). Stable first-person, no head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax ("meteors stitched quick seams"); no loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors—linguistic vehicles consistent. Figurative density purposeful in lyric mode, charges closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost tutor, seal-stamping buildings, meteor grammar transforms trope of urban alienation; risk in nonlinear reflections heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in "borrowed authority."</comment>
