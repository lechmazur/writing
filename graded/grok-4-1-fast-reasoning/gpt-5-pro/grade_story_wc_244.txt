<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary: Mara's contradictory impulses shine in "desperately jocular" smile promising breakfast amid chaos, earning her elusive endurance with felt cost as she's "seen only by their needs," close enough to love without correction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rumor chains to queue catalyzing solace market, delivering CR closure in ledger note "This is the moment when the story changes" and rock-to-ivy handoff, reweighting isolation with conceptual cost of polite anarchy's threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station anchors selectively (flood-drowned timetable, tracks spared), mirroring internal states; recurring ivy constrains final rock placement, charging closure image with slow green patience-testing breath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure loneliness via logistics) signaled early, escalates texturally via rock rumor tightening to community market; agency in spreading dare- rumor forecloses isolation with legible relational cost, though no micro-turn sharpens further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity curing loneliness emerges organically from trades/ledger/rumors, resonating in CR final image of rock glowing via "teamwork of lonely people," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual bias (rumors "like birds," rock "like a whisper adjusting its coat"); stable third-limited POV with rhythmic modulation under elusive pressure, elisions taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (e.g., "hammock" of favors); figurative saturation risks slight overwrite in descriptive peaks but coheres via pattern, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms moon-rock trope into rumor catalyst for "polite anarchy" community, inevitable in hindsight from logistician premise; bold lyric risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
