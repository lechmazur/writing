<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses—steal light vs. recognize future self—act simultaneously in the recognition scene ("My jar flickered like it recognized master and apprentice"), earning the final renunciation with visible cost of not capturing the portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to CR closure in the shared listening ("We listened together, cheek to metal") where self-recognition reconfigures the theft premise with conceptual cost of redistributed choices; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station's "tiles greener" by moonlight and "brass service door" constrain the pivotal choice, charging the final image of exhaling station; sensory details like "cut stems and station metal" filter through thief's savvy bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing illuminated choices tightens via reflection reveal narrowing options to stay/miss train; agency in unscrewing jar and leaning to door forecloses theft path with legible cost of "delayed courage."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light-forged choices emerges organically from particulars like moonbeams gilding "raggedness," resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing: "the you was me" invites ambiguity on self-theft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with perceptual signature ("light made everyone briefly their truest story") modulates rhythm under pressure; stable POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "moonbeams pooled around his laces, like minnows testing a river mouth"; minor metaphor density in peak recognition beat slightly risks coherence but pattern holds without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical light-thief in mundane station yields inevitable self-encounter twist grown from flower codes and reflections; risk-taking in poetic causality heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
