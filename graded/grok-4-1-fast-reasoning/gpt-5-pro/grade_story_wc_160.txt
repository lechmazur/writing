<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses shine in "math and mercy arguing," compelling the final harmonization choice with visible cost in steadier heartbeat. Mentor backstory anchors reflection to present via envelope, tilting choices without flattening pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing in reflections ("encrypted compassion") avoids peak deduction as embodied in actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early breathing motif to Charged Poise closure in "machinery and mercy kept time together," reweighting premise with felt cost of learned listening. Orientation anchors firmly by amphitheater arrival; resin-chain discovery tightens as single meaningful deepening. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices via breathing rhythm dictating schedule, charging final image; "chain quiver against my wrist" exemplifies tactile integration mirroring internal states. Sensory hierarchy (warm drafts, slatted light) reflects machinist's priorities without tourist catalog. Recurring volcano lung motif evolves causally, no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harmonize values signaled early escalates accumulatively through resin decoding and gate test, narrowing options with trade-off in bat flows vs. orchards. Agency in analysis/presentation drives deepening; cost legible in council's softened arguments and farmer's nod. No abstract stakes or coincidences resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of compassion-through-engineering emerges organically from particulars like resin pattern matching chain, reweighting in final "slyly heartfelt metronome" without moralizing. Subtext in silences (council tempers drop) invites ambiguity on fairness calibration. Protagonist arc inextricable from question, no Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of breaths/gears; rhythmic modulation peaks in "tremble...tightens the fit." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("how the schedule was chosen"), advances plot via goal pursuit. Stable first-person with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "scrape a film...revealing tiny beads"); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax propels via fragments like "I tremble." Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("stone lung," "fossilized waves") purposeful for pattern, no muddle at closure. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machinist decoding mentor's resin code in breathing volcano transforms engineering trope via "listening to rocks breathe." Risky lyric structure heightens stakes coherently; no derivative echoes, bold premise commits fully without hedging.</comment>
