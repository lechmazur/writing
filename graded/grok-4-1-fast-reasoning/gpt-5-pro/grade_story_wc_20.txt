<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied contradictions like "names fall heavy... heavier than steel if guilt is the flux," driving micro-choices in alchemy; final renunciation of miracles earned by causal buildup of regret and method. Contradictory impulses act on-page in weighing safety as misnamed love.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sorting ash to forging disc, tightening to Charged Poise closure in "press it warm against my wrist" where cost of imperfection/hatred crystallizes. Orientation anchored in opening line; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Foundry's steam, sparks, rain constrain crafting choices and charge final image ("rain takes its first small drink from the seams"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (alchemical priorities like "slag-light"). Micro-setting as anvil/metal evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem via balance) signaled early, deepens texturally through forging beats narrowing to honest disc; agency in "hammer the coin... inlay the cracks" forecloses miracles with legible cost of failure-map and accepted hatred.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption as "joining that makes memory and metal agree" emerges organically from particulars, resonant in final disc image reweighting premise without moral; complexity in "stubbornness, when loved, sometimes names itself back."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct alchemical perceptual signature ("names alloy with deeds") and rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure; stable first-person with purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative saturation ("luminous regret that burns without consuming") borders overwriting in dense beats (−0.4); no loops, strong read-aloud rhythm, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi-alchemy-loss transforms tropes organically; bold lyric risk in "balanced alchemist" frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via coin-to-disc arc.</comment>
