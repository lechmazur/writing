<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene ("doubts pull him back, empirically ironic") leading to earned final humility and covenant; micro-choices like aligning tile reveal frugal piety under pressure. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in "hunger...not for bread or coin."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via alignments to Charged Poise closure ("ash shivered, then stilled...covenant sealed by attention") with legible humility cost in final image of reduced self. Anchored early; no orientation debt; persistent tile constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ceiling map and palace proportions constrain choices (aligning sums to claws reveals eyelid), charging closure (river meets tile's center). Sensory selection vivid and POV-biased (frugal gaze on "chipped lapis," "mica" spark).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covenant) signaled early tightens texturally via deepening (passage uncloaks, vow pledged) with agency; cost unmistakable in tile sacrifice and "man diminished into a method." Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "piety with proofs" emerges organically from particulars, resonant non-literal answer in final mirror reducing him to method against "encrypted devotion." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "keep the rest hidden."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (frugal economy in phrasing like "counting each item like coins") with rhythmic control; stable single POV, purposeful elevated diction fits astronomer's voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors purposeful ("histories...joining budgets") propel without muddle. Propulsion peaks clean in closure ("ash into mirrored night").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square piety in reimagined Babylonian interregnum transforms tropes; risk in poetic accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via tile's arc.</comment>
