<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to bridge wisdom feels rooted in daughter backstory and guild past, with micro-choices like using ribbon revealing contradictory gentleness under repair pressure. Kids apply secondary pressure via skepticism, forcing adaptation. Final persistence handing map earns change with ribbon's felt cost, but some reflective summaries slightly abstract internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to repair beats toward Charged Poise closure in "bellwater giggled... remembered fruit" and map handover, reweighting breaches with orchard's honest thirst. Orientation anchors early at north door. One tightening via leak's weeping narrows options; cost legible in ribbon darkening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cathedral orchard vividly selective—smells of leaves/sap/wet stone, fruits thudding—constrains repair via rafters/pipe proximity and bag tools. Recurrent pipe/roots mirror internal states through action. Final drip to soil charges image, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend pipe, impart wisdom) signaled early, tightens texturally as repair weeps despite wire/washers, forcing ribbon trade-off. Kids' brittle arguments add coherent pressure; agency in adaptations culminates in map's seasonal handshake with visible ribbon cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of breaches vs. organic growth emerges via orchard imagery and vows explanation, reweighted non-literally in kid's whisper "promises get heavy" and leak's taught accent. Final image resists tidy moral, embracing ambiguity of wet ribbon as gained speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with tree/leaf diction reflects mender's perceptual bias; stable first-person focalization biases toward generational roots. Kids' dialogue natural/subtextual ("fined questions"), distinct idiom advances plot. Rhythm modulates with repair intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "It still wept, which is how repairs confess" advances character/prose). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (cracks running, saplings shrugging) without muddle in peak repair. Minor density in opening reflection but purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard-breaching cathedral and quartz-eye mender synthesize fresh premise; deciduous vows transform contract trope via tree logic. Risky lyric compression feels inevitable in map/ribbon close, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
