<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation as "conscience for hire" compels micro-choices like chime translation and shard offering; Mara's internal conflict embodied in "throat moves when futures test their weight" and cloak release forces relational change. Final shard handover earns credible endurance with felt porosity cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as chime sequences and object interactions deepen nuance stake; single scene oriented by ~line 10 ("breezy lighthouse at dawn"). Closure as Charged Poise RR in shard-into-ledger and lighter cloak image reconfigures certainty with undeniable emotional cost, legible in "careful permission to be porous."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse with chimes constrains choices via wind-activated "coded clicks" and dawn light through shard charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (wind drafts, sea breathing) reflects POV priorities; micro-objects like cloak and mirror evolve tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's signing as "knife" for quay demolition) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via two chime sequences narrowing to conditional plan. Agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses simplistic certainty with on-page cost in lighter cloak and open doorways; cost unmistakable in "honor memory, staged walls."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of protected vulnerability emerges organically from particulars like taped shard and chime "conversation"; subtext in silences and implications avoids morals. Final image of "practicing sincerity... slowly, sincerely insincere" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without statement, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature ("questions like lanterns, hooded"); voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, prose as character in poetic compression taught early. Dialogue sparse but subtextual ("what I am really selling"), natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping, diction biased to narrator's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "She raises it, and the dawn falls in, painting her cheek with sea"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language pattern-taught from opener, coherent without muddle in peak beats like cloak unhook; syntax propels via varied openings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Conscience for hire" premise freshly synthesizes doubt-rental with wind-chime method, transforming introspection tropes via tactile objects; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established particulars; bold voice commits without retreat, earning +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
