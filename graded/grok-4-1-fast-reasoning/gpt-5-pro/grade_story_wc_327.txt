<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene (surrendering personal names for communal via diamond's appetite), earning the final transformation as instrument with visible cost in copper-veined fixation; interiority concrete and particular (quiet bruise of promise, cracks as libraries). No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing; flaws (trust in failures) complicate choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from bird-guided touches to name-surrender and copper integration, landing Charged Poise RR at "Now I speak as an instrument... into whoever listens next" with undeniable conceptual cost (personal erasure for language's survival). Orientation anchored in opening line; one tightening via curse's escalating appetite suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Towers, tunnel, and bone constrain choices (palm/diamond placements per bird curves) and charge final image (copper vines fixing diamond in bone); sensory hierarchy (textures to sounds) filtered through storyteller's bias, vivid yet selective. Micro-setting (flock shadows on bone) mirrors internal curve toward surrender.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue fading language) signaled early, tightens via diamond's thirst demanding names ("I let go of my first kiss...") forcing trade-off endurance; agency in surrender forecloses personal identity with on-page cost, coherent under Accumulative lens. Minor abstractness in initial promise slightly mutes early visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice for cultural continuity emerges organically from particulars (bird-grammar, name-eating curse, texture-to-voice), reweighting via final image of carried language without moralizing; ambiguity in curse's "grammar" (appetite not malice) lingers productively. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of memory's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (textures as intentions, silences as commas) and rhythmic control modulate from quiet awe to peak thirst/surrender; single POV stable, voice as "copper-veined storyteller" biases noticing (friction becomes voice). Lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Cracks are libraries" advances character/world/prose); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds, figurative pattern taught consistently without muddle in peak (diamond thirst). Minor register elevation in spots ("grammar of turns") borders opacity under stress but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of synesthetic language-rescue (birds as syntax, diamond devouring names) feels inevitable, transforming tropes (cursed artifact, dying tongue) via specific risks like vein-wire; bold lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
