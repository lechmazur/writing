<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contemplative glassblower's interiority shines through embodied micro-choices like mouthing breaths while holding the bookmark in teeth, revealing contradictory stubbornness and mercy; final endurance of crafting bells earns closure with visible cost of isolation. Traits shown via actions, not labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from frost-sweeping to three bells, with melting drips as cadence markers tightening to Charged Poise RR in final image of steadier hands mirroring questions as home; orientation anchored early ("abandoned control room...studio"), closure cost felt in persistent ruin-work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Control room's gauges, drips, and cold constrain fire's shyness and shape glass curves; recurring bookmark and intercom charge final buoyant bells over dead mic, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy (drips as metronomes) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting inquiry domes escalates accumulatively via generator cough and ice sheets, forcing endurance choices like singing to machine; cost legible in "pledged not to abandon" and continent-crossing, charging final promise without resolving to tidy win.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared heat vs. hoarding emerges via particulars like bell over intercom answering "Who benefits when heat is hoarded"; final mirroring puddles/hands offers non-literal resonance reweighting inquiry as home, with ambiguity in strangers' note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in dramatic self-narration ("Cue the oxygen") and biased noticing (drips as "kindly teachers"); rhythmic control modulates from weighty to buoyant, stable first-person with no leakage, prose as character in contemplative syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (glass as "stubborn mirror," drips as "slow metronomes") integrated into action; minor paraphrase loops in "thawing" recurrences purposeful for pattern but slightly overtax closure image. Varied rhythm propels without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glassblower in control-room studio transforms isolation trope via thawing parallels and narrated rituals; fresh synthesis of craft as inquiry sanctuary feels inevitable, with risk in lyric endurance heightening stakes organically.</comment>
