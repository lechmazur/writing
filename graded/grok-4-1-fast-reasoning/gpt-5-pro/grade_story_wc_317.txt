<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Proprietor's motivation to safeguard innovation drives planting the seed and designing the Seed room, with embodied receptivity (lantern on wet stones) revealing character under developer pressure; minor summary of ethics dilutes peak choice intensity but doesn't undermine earned community shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mystery mail shards build density to Charged Poise closure in final letter and seed-protected future image, with conceptual cost legible ("Forgive the distance"); mosaic shards taught early via poetic transitions, orientation anchored by brook in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brook and lanterns constrain choices (niche planting) and charge final breathing image; sensory specifics (moss, sweetly rotten spray) filter through POV urgency, evolving with events without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (brook/innovation vs. developers) accumulates via mail arrivals and seed growth, tightening when pendant evokes Mae, forcing orthogonal tactics; cost felt in indirect play over confrontation, visible in community lung moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of play/indirect protection emerges organically from seed tactics vs. direct petitions, resonant in final image reweighting certainty with flow; no moralizing, ambiguity in Mae's distance lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (puzzles as weather systems, receptive hum) sustains first-person stability; rhythmic modulation (short hush phrases amid lyric swells) heightens pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric repetition (hush, spiral) taught early, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors cohere (pressure to release) without muddle in peak seed-sprout dawn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape room as defense via corpse flower/seed mail transforms developer trope through orthogonal play; risk in mosaic lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Mae's spiral.</comment>
