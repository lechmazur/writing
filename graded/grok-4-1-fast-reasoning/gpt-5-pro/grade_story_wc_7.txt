<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chef's motivation rooted in tasting memories drives planting with embodied cost (bartered grandmother's rain); Kye's arc from sanctioned blandness to tears forces relational choice. Internal conflict in pruning grief acts simultaneously with hope. Minor epiphanic summary in Kye's line ("arranging is how I will refuse") slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from unlocking to sprouting via sensory patterns; closure as Charged Poise in seed's eye-opening shoot and rebellion vision, cost legible in traded memory and tears irrigating brain. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains via pruning skeletons for light access and shattered panes threading planetary braids into cathedral; recurring glass/swept constellations charges final ritual circle. Sensory hierarchy chef-specific (tasting sweat as childhood). POV bias filters ruins as recipe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant seed for memory rebellion vs Quiet Diet) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Kye's arrival and alignment peak forcing micro-choices; cost felt in tears and pruned grief foreclosing erasure path. Escalation via density to broth-sharing climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion emerges via flavors coaxing synapses, not slogans; final image of bowls in circle reweights ruins-to-beauty without moral state. Subtext in Kye's tears layering grief/joy; ambiguity in word-spreading like bread invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV stable first-person with perceptual signature (tasting as primary sense); voice modulates rhythmically from simmers to planetary chords. Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (Kye measures danger, chef hands shears). Minor register elevation consistent with wise idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences at sprouting); density high, metaphors purposeful for textural lens. Minor overwrite: stacked figures like "braid their light... long spines... patient geometry" in alignment beat borders coherence (-0.4). No loops, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-tasting chef smuggling seed for synaptic rebellion transforms dystopian trope via flavors/biology poetry. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight; seed reprise heightens stakes uniquely.</comment>
