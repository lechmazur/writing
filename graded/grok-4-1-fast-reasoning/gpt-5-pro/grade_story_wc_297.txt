<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied contradictions shine in "anxious elation, a trembling joy paced by fear, as if I am both the hound and the rabbit," driving micro-choices like pressing the maze to wrist; girl's scars force relational crucible without diluting focalizer's visionary flaws. Earned shift from bound isolation to threaded connection feels particular and costly. Minor abstraction in "covenant stitched" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure: "covenant slide into alignment like stars" reconfigures binding as interconnection with felt cost of ongoing threading. Orientation anchors early in glade/root imagery. Single scene tightens purposefully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Roots and glade constrain movement ("Movement here is not a step but a seam") and charge final image; sensory selection (sap murmurs, moths geometrize) filters through visionary bias, evolving with events like paths waking under grass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill eclipsed covenant) signaled early, texturally escalates via deepening imagery to crosswind possibilities, narrowing to scar-linking agency with legible wound-cost; girl's arrival complicates without resolving. Minor abstractness in "intersection of dreams" slightly mutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden covenants emerges organically from scars/maps/oaths, culminating in resonant non-literal answer: "we become what we were promised" reweights early arrivals with internal shine, no moralizing. Complexity lingers in binding's ambiguous freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (trees mutter, sap remembers) biases all noticing; stable first-person modulates rhythm with intensity, e.g., short "Both" dialogue carries subtext. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax/openings, high density in peak ("welts converge, a bell rings"); figurative overload risks minor muddle ("shadow cheated time" strains logic), docking from 9-band without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic ecology transforms tropes (eclipse covenants) via scar-maps and root-threading; risky lyric risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "step into the shared wind without taking a step."</comment>
