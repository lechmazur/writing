<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's embodied interiority shines in bellows stitched to ribs and breath controlling aperture, revealing contradictory impulses (shallow vs. full breaths thinning/blooming image); friend's subtle pressure via synced breathing earns relational shift. Final realization of love as breath-attention feels compelled by prior micro-choices. Minor abstract epiphany phrasing ("decode it by breathing again") slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image-density build from foggy setup to synced breaths forming salted-paper nebula; orientation anchors immediately in viaduct/box. Closure as CR ("storehouse is breath, key is to spend it in attentive kindness") lands on-page with conceptual cost of prior abandonment reweighted. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (fog in stones, whisk sparks as comet, vines breathing) filters through artist's priorities, constraining choices via arches/weeds framing image. Micro-setting of box/tear charges final viaduct-leaning image. Environment mirrors internal softening without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unused love's storehouse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening breaths revealing woman/kettle, narrowing to synced exposure foreclosing blurred past. Agency in diaphragm-widening bears cost of "aches to flow" made light. Climax sync forces stance crystallization under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unused love pooling in breaths emerges organically from particulars (cooling tea, droplets as forgiveness code), reweighting abandonment premise via CR without statement. Final image of prints teaching others to breathe offers resonant, non-literal answer. Lingering ambiguity in healing-without-owning embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature in light/breath metaphors; voice rhythm modulates from foggy indirection to lucid realization. Minimal dialogue ("purpose plainly") natural/subtextual. Lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "breathing" recurrence propelling via syntax variation; no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (tear softening to nebula). Rhythm breathes with scene (short sentences in sync beat). Minor figurative density in peak ("pliable filament") stays legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura/breath-bellows with steel-wool sparks transforms spiritual-art trope into inevitable CR on love-as-attention. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes via patterned elision, fully committed to foggy-lucid vision without hedging.</comment>
