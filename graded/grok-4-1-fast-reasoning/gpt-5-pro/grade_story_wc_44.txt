<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Budding scholar's motivation rooted in curiosity drives deliberate micro-choices like polishing lenses and scratching runes, earning renunciation of theft; contradictory impulses peak in confession to Archivist, with embodied relief ("light weight leaves my ribs") as cost. Internal voice particular, flaws in impatience balanced by hands that "remember better." Final patience with "teeth" reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup rituals to model vision, culminating in CR where shadows' path reweights premise with humility's cost ("refuse to take"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene progression spirals coherently to legible before/after in final page-writing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating isle pressured by shadow-fuel altitude constrains prying choice; brass floors, lacquered pods, ring pathways tactile and lived-in, charging closure image of copper ribbon. Sensory hierarchy rune-scholar biased (tides licking boots); evolves with steam-breath ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows' noon path) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Archivist warning to model-building, narrowing to respectful witness; agency in rune-scratching forecloses theft with felt cost (isle steadies, ribs lighten). One deepening vision reconfigures knowledge under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loops/returns emerges organically from spirals, ouroboric model, shadow-teachers; final image ("humility is the shortest circle") non-literal CR reweights seeking without resonant moralizing. Particulars like pods' equations avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spiral diction, rune-biased noticing ("prayers whose last words are rounds"); stable first-person, rhythmic modulation peaks in vision ("drawings of my own future hands"). Archivist dialogue subtextual, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring loops; purposeful repetition ("closing loops") taught early, no loops/scaffold dull closure. Minor metaphor density in rituals coherent, not overwriting pivotal model beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-fuel, spoon-bent reality, loop rituals transforms fantasy tropes; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable CR from rune particulars without retreat.</comment>
