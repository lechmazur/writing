<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in storm reflection ("redemption had refused me or... waited inside a jar"), earning final selfless promise with visible cost of revising past flight; interiority particular via jarred sounds embodying wistful service. No unearned epiphanies or label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound harvests densify to storm cadence shift and morning CR closure ("jar named Kin"), reweighting self-doubt with conceptual cost legible in final beach walk; orientation anchored by loft/dawn in first graph, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dune fox and leaking loft constrain storm bracing and jar choices, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (sounds over sights) POV-specific, selective like "sand whispering... restless coins," mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via translation) signaled early, tightens via storm memory deepening knowledge/cost of mother's vow; agency in bottling/giving jars forecloses isolation path, cost felt in "quiet revision" though minor abstractness tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sound-bridges emerges implicitly from jar exchanges culminating in "Kin" jar reweighting cheap rhymes as dynasty heartbeat; resonant non-literal answer in final walk avoids moralizing, complexity in wistful solitude-to-kinship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (language as "wet from breakers, dries into bridges") modulates rhythmically under storm stress; stable first-person with purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "lightning wrote its crooked essay" doing image/atmosphere/pressure; varied rhythm survives read-aloud, minor metaphor density in reflections coherent and pattern-taught without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound-jars transform vagrant trope into fresh synthesis of memory-capture/redemption, inevitable in hindsight via fox/bookend dawn; risky lyric accrual heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
