<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotions (squinting as "truth through pain") and contradictory impulses (panic vs. pattern-seeking via counting); final endurance/acceptance of boundaries earned by causal micro-choices like key on petcock. Father's influence anchors traits without dominating. No label-speak; flaws like ritual dependence complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drift pattern breaks accumulate density, leading to CR closure ("clocks... measure the changes we can bear") with conceptual cost of accepting frayed edges. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via "eminently peculiar" leap steadies via agency. Cost legible in final acceptance image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station mechanics (floats, filaments, petcock) constrain choices (key adjustment) and charge closure; fjord/horizon razor edges filter through professional POV, evolving with clouds. Sensory hierarchy vivid (wet pluck vs. ticks); micro-setting (brass, key) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix drift/understand time) signaled early, escalates via peculiar leap and doubt, tightening through counting/agency to Charged Poise (station contents, accepts grief). Cost felt in patience sharpened; one decisive deepening narrows to endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time as boundaries emerges organically from particulars (horizon knife, clocks quarrel); final CR reweights premise non-literally ("sharpen patience") with lingering ambiguity on merging. No moralizing; resonance from shepherd guidance motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (musical metaphors: "held note," "sang numbers"); rhythm modulates pressure (short counts vs. flowing hush). Stable single-POV; purposeful compression taught early, paid in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; metaphors coherent/patterned (knife edges, choir). Minor density slip in reflective chains, but no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion; purposeful overwriting serves texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydraulic station solitude with time philosophy; transforms tropes (inherited duty, quiet night) via razor/knife ingenuity. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from fjord-to-hearth arc.</comment>
