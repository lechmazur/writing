<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to debunk rooted in observant traits drives micro-choices like reassembling letters, with contradictory impulses peaking in the empathetic final decision to omit names, earning renunciation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries build density to CR closure: holding the diamond reconfigures myth into engineering truth, with conceptual cost legible in "truth rearranges a life"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via letters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stillpoint pool where "dust fell straight down as if on strings" constrains investigation and charges final dust-building image, with sensory details (ticking trees, shivering bark) filtered through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debunk miracle) signaled early tightens texturally via stillpoint entry and letter revelation, forcing agency in diamond handling; Klay's "what I would write" crystallizes stance with opportunity cost on truth-telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. comfortable lies emerges organically, resonant in diamond's "milky eye" reweighting curse to disorienting honesty without moralizing; final request "leave the names out" answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct first-person voice with perceptual bias ("miracles make me itch") modulates rhythm under pressure; Klay's dialogue carries subtext ("faith runs deeper than fallout"), natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative language ("leaves like polished armor") varies rhythm without muddle; no loops or scaffolds, propulsion peaks cleanly in closure image of building dust.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc orchard as dust-net via flawed diamond harp transforms miracle tropes; risk in poetic sci-fi texture heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via letter payoff.</comment>
