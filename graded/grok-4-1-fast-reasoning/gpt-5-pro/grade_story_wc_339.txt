<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular ("grief made its proofs in salt and pressure"); contradictory analytic/grieving impulses act in scene via wire untangling and globe glances; final renunciation of globe earned by layered discoveries with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via tape decode and ticket reveal to CR closure ("the math forgive me finally") with conceptual cost legible in globe release; orientation anchored early in library; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and embodied (books "spined like fish," globe's "trapped bubble trembled"); snow globe as micro-setting constrains glances/actions and charges final image; underwater decay mirrors internal release without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify letting go) signaled early, tightens texturally via message/ticket deepening knowledge/options; agency in decoding/release forecloses clinging with felt cost in "second heart" thump and upward drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of surrender emerges implicitly from particulars (Morse "LET GO TO LIVE," ticket stub); final globe image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in personal absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in oceanic lyricism ("fins brushed...silt and memory"); stable first-person with rhythmic modulation under pressure; sparse radio dialogue natural/subtextual, advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("teasing wire from wire until the knot remembered it had edges"); minor figurative density in opening ("sailed ripping") but consistent/voice-motivated without muddle; no loops, varied rhythm to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dive archaeology, Earhart frame, and globe/ticket as letting-go vectors; risk-taking in sustained lyric compression heightens stakes; turns inevitable from library particulars without template echoes.</comment>
