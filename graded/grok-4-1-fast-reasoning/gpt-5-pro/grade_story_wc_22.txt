<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation to reclaim the battlefield roots deeply in consistent traits like bird-reading and dead-language speaking, compelling patient micro-choices like pod placement; interiority shines in embodied grief via "scent fells him to quiet tears" with veteran. Minor abstractness in emotions ("harmony is a patient sentence") avoids full contradiction in peak serenity, but voice specificity elevates. Final veteran exchange earns endurance with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in bird-ledgers, pod rituals, and garden progress toward CR closure: "the garden will sign its name where the battle wrote noise" reweights war-to-peace with patience cost legible in "misread a trill, the seedlings sulk." Orientation anchors early ("blooming jetty at twilight"); one tightening via veteran crystallizes stakes without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains choices via bird-mapped "buried iron, salt veins"; twilight "pulls the harbor narrow" mirrors internal "narrow vastness" and charges final image. Sensory bias (bird cries as "paragraphs," guano as "ink") filters through coachman's priorities; coral-crushing integrates action with post-reef specificity, evolving causally to "powder...into grammar for roots."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclaiming battlefield) signaled early, escalates texturally via misreads ("seedlings sulk") and veteran encounter narrowing to shared planting; agency in fertilizing/assigning pods forecloses waste path with "grammar punishes" cost. Veteran beat forces stance crystallization under lens; one deepening suffices, cost unmistakable in tears and "bruises we no longer carry."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of peace as "submerged concord" emerges from particulars like reef-to-fertilizer cycle and bird annotations, reweighting war remnants without statement; final image answers reclamation question resonantly via "wings and oars sharing a pace." Subtext in pod "rosaries" and dead tongues avoids morals, embracing ambiguity of "patient sentence, mostly commas."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("birds wrote paragraphs," "speak dead languages to them") biases noticing toward omen/grammar; rhythmic modulation peaks in terse veteran dialogue ("Plant it where you bled") with subtextual goal pursuit. Stable POV distance, voice as character via fragmented lyricism taught early; no head-hopping, elision pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines ("wheels sainted with pollen"); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion in short veteran beat. Minor figurative density ("hush that followed, I learned to listen sideways") risks overwrite in reflective stretches but patterns purposefully without muddle or loops touching closure; no scaffold, strong verbs propel to "ferrying us into tomorrow."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman-as-gardener using bird semiotics and dead languages transforms post-apocalyptic reclamation trope organically; risk in lyric elision heightens stakes via irreplaceable "grammar of what has fallen silent." Veteran cipher-pod turn feels inevitable from prior rituals; no derivatives, bold tonal vastness commits fully.</comment>
