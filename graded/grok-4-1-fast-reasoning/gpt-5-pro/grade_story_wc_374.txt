<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of doubt versus taste-pulled action act throughout, culminating in earned belief-with-testing at "I believed her, though a luminous skeptic cannot stop testing," with visible cost to skepticism. Naira applies relational pressure sharpening the central motive. Flawless embodiment via tastes avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via taste density building to CR closure at "I put the tin compass ring back on... tasting the future," reweighting skepticism with conceptual cost of endless next promise. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt. Pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bluff spine constrains convergence choice, charging final image; tastes as micro-setting evolve with pressure. Sensory hierarchy (taste-dominant) reflects POV bias perfectly. Aurora/forest details integrated into action without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn weather carriers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via taste shifts narrowing to convergence release under lens; cost legible in duties lifted but next direction pointed. One decisive deepening at flavor-map sufficient and agency-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonant non-literal answer emerges at ending image of afterglow direction, reweighting memory/duty theme from priors without moralizing. Particulars like taste-promises build complexity organically. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct taste-perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation under pressure; Naira's dialogue subtextual and idiomatic. Stable first-person with no leakage. Experimental compression legible and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density purposeful with taste-pattern propulsion, but figurative overload in climax ("flavors locked... clicking its teeth") borders coherence slip without obscuring closure. No loops; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor scaffold in repetitive tasting stems contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taste-sensing world, weather-memory carriers, forest ballots transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens stakes inevitably. No derivatives; irreplaceable ingenuity in flavor-map.</comment>
