<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in shift from "ledger lined up like seed flats" to "plan that was more like a prayer," with embodied humility (leaf on boot) earning the final renunciation of control. Micro-choices like opening channels reveal values under storm pressure. Theo's presence forces relational micro-turns without overwhelming single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations densify to gale test ("trellis shivered but did not split") and night reconfiguration, landing Charged Poise closure where "leaf decide[s] where the next shelter belongs" reweights mastery premise with humility cost. Orientation anchored early (nursery, storm season). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis constrains gale action ("held the posts," "moss had stitched seams") and charges final image via proximity lesson. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: drip lines, glistening veins over generics. Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (predict/control vs. yield) tightens texturally in gale reversal, forcing endurance with visible cost ("count losses, still tuck seedlings"). Agency in releasing control narrows options, charging closure poise. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship emerges organically from leaf's path and trellis breath, culminating in resonant CR: "let the leaf decide" reweights premise without moralizing. Particulars (fern spores as "passengers") avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "awkward... honesty."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature lyrical/plant-inflected ("leaf curled like a listening ear," "wind had other syllables") modulates rhythmically with intensity, stable first-person. Theo's dialogue subtextual ("choosing routes toward survival or toward me"), distinct idiom. No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The linden by the gate laid a new page... glistened as if mapping"); rhythm breathes with scene. Minor paraphrase loops in reflections ("taught me") pattern-taught, not obscuring gale clarity. No closure artifacts or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nursery as "damp rib cage" transforms nature-lesson trope via textural leaf-tracking and gale poise. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without opacity; irreplaceable specifics (spores, coffee-ring sketch) feel inevitable.</comment>
