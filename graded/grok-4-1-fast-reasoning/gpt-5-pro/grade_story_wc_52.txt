<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses to contain without trapping act through carving micro-choices; final endurance earned by embodied loss (wrist ache line) with visible cost in shaped grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as carving density tightens to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "Loss does not become less, but it becomes shaped" reconfiguring options without erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring ash blank and sugar crystal constrain choices and charge final pocketed cage image; sensory hierarchy (dry green scent) reflects POV practicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harvest lessons escalates accumulatively via carving progress and kettle pressure; agency in endurance forecloses uncontained grief with on-page cost in shaped loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of practical containment emerges organically from carving and memories; final image non-literally answers "here and gone" via pocketed cage reweighting prior grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (practical lyricism, e.g., "terror is the bright flare in the straw"); rhythmic control heightens emotional beats without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful pattern (here/gone refrain) propels via varied rhythm; minor metaphor density in peak carving avoided muddle by consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-taming metaphor into grief-carving transforms widow trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via portable cage ingenuity.</comment>
