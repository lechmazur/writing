<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in "directed spontaneity" (loose plans vs. precise vials) act in scene, compelling higher-stakes whisper; final success earned by prior failed attempts with vulnerability cost in Lio's secret. Interiority concrete via embodied images like "stain my palm gold." Lio's pressure via touch and concise speech reveals relational crucible without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via vial mixes and laps to whisper-triggered bloom, delivering Charged Poise RR where "presence compresses, warm as held breath" reconfigures coefficients with conceptual cost of revaluing fear/trust. Orientation anchored early ("ember nexus at twilight"). Single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus and reactor constrain choices (lay on grate, open iris); nautilus spine charges final "dimming like a yawn" image. Sensory hierarchy poetic yet selective (steam "stitches into velvet," hush). Plaza evolves causally, mirroring internal density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture presence density) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via recalibrations to secret-whisper climax narrowing options; cost legible in "numbers... like promises" clinging and past evaporation's felt weight. Agency in mixing/touch drives under lens; moral calculus in "scientifically romantic" resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of presence's mass emerges organically from vial mixes and laps; final "joy has the heft of a carefully placed stone" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in Lio's whisper charges ambiguity of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("spirals remember"); rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short breaths at hush). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You brought the cobalt vials"), advances via secret. Stable single POV, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("reactor accepts... soft scald"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Metaphors consistent/pattern-taught (density as "bead, like rain"), coherent in peak whisper beat. Minor figurative density purposeful for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical physics (presence as measurable mass via reactor/nautilus) transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric prose heightens stakes, inevitable in "city feels sturdy underfoot." No derivatives, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
