<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in archivist's mentoring amid own irreversible exile, embodied in "I walk backwards when nervous" and final held stillness; contradictory impulses act in ritual choices. Girl's defiance via sneakers and shrug reveals values without stereotypes. Final endurance earned with visible cost of personal exile persisting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jar arrival through tea geometry to hinge glyph, yielding Charged Poise closure in brother's unfolding and archivist's sachet sweep. On-page cost legible in "my own exile was not yet reversible." Orientation anchored early in library shards; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurrent jar, mirror shard, and tea bowl constrain ritual choices and charge final annotated lectern image. Sensory hierarchy (warm jar, dust script, coughing dust) filters through archivist's perceptual bias. Spatial choreography coherent in aisle unlock at playground hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reversible exile signaled early, escalates via tea hinge tightening options to memory challenge; agency in annotations and speaking to shadow forecloses non-forgiveness path. Protagonist endurance crystallizes stance with legible cost in brother's return versus archivist's stasis. Accumulative deepening driven by ritual micro-choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Combative tenderness emerges organically from "argued kindly with the corridor" and "arm wrestle charged with mercy," reweighting exile premise in final ledger annotation without moralizing. Resonant answer in archivist mentoring others' hinge amid own locked door. Particulars like hinge glyph avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in glyph-seeing ("slivers of sight like spiteful petals") and rhythmic modulation under ritual pressure; dialogue subtextual ("exile is a corridor that can be walked both ways"). Stable first-person with purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at shadow grin alignment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "steeped tea... waiting for the leaves to settle into an answer"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language consistent in lyric pattern, no muddle in climax jar-lightening beat. Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shard-archiving and tea geometry transforms exile trope into inevitable ritual logic; bold poetic voice risks lyric density heightening stakes without gimmickry. Final "walls argue back and open" inflects premise non-obviously from prior particulars.</comment>
