<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory doubt ("doubt gnawed") acts alongside forging actions in dives; final charm sacrifice earned by prior micro-choices with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build via dives/pattern-matching to RR closure; legible cost in "dropped the loop into the crucible" reconfigures engine/meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Statue pockmarks as "constellations" constrain pivotal matching choice; acid vat forces underwater work, charging final mapped craters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjure meaning/save craft) signaled early, deepens via fissure to agency-driven sacrifice under accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in charm forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from mending actions; final "break itself became an artery" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("pockmarks became a sky his fingers could read"); rhythmic lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; purposeful dive pattern repetition builds texture without loops; figurative coherence in "kintsugi intentions" enhances peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acid-sea gears, charm sacrifice, pockmark ratios transforms tropes; kintsugi mechanics inevitable in hindsight, risks lyric compression coherently.</comment>
