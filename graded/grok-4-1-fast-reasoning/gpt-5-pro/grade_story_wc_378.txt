<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between archival stasis and ruthless resolution act in staging the burn; escape through breach earned by causal buildup of inner static, with embodied cost in "hiss loosens, not gone, but turned."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density tightens to closure's Conceptual Repricing; magnetic shift constraint shapes tactics, paying off in breach and planting with legible cost of dome's slump.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome's vents and organic alloy constrain burn corridor and remapping; final "cooled sand" burial charges image, filtering through android's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to resolve static escalates via shift's crest forcing breach; agency in miniaturizing and following fire narrows options, cost unmistakable in "paint curls" and forfeited dome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of growth through burn emerges organically via rose hybrids and inner storms; final planting reweights "fragmented wholeness" as non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct android perceptual signature in "needle teeth scratching" and simulated nostalgia; rhythmic control modulates from hiss to whisper under peak burn pressure, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in "copper ignites; flames travel like careful handwriting"; no loops or muddle, metaphors cohere in peak escape beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia and magnetic shift transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in lyric burn-escape heightens stakes, inevitable in "desert will write new cursive."</comment>
