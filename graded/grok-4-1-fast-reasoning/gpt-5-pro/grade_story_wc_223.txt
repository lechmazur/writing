<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses (tempted to perform but harvests small) act in scene, with final permission nod earned via scar-anchored reflection tilting present choices. Custodian's ruthlessness shown in pruning flourishes. Closure renunciation of past scripts carries visible cost in unbinding cord.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: walking patterns accumulate voices into ribbon, tightening to grief migration with conceptual cost in "teach it to migrate." Charged Poise closure in nod as "sentence and pardon" reconfigures role. Orientation anchored early in gallery/interregnum; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concentric tiles constrain walking choices; dome breath "smelling of iodine and smoke" charges voices' emergence. Recurring marble bench/chessboard anchors spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy reflects historian motive, mirroring internal migration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (historian of gestures) signaled early, deepens via voices braiding "ribbon I could touch" narrowing to grief's weight. Agency in unbinding cord forecloses scripted past with felt scar-cost. Escalation accumulates under textural lens to charged final words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory's choreography emerges from walking particulars, reweighted in calluses spelling HOME without moralizing. Final lantern image answers rebuilding question resonantly. Subtext in small sounds vs. grand collapse avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (small gestures, breaths as weather) modulates rhythm under pressure. Sparse dialogue subtextual ("Walk BEGIN"); POV stable, elision of past taught early and paid in steps. Diction reflects embodied survivor mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines like "braided into a ribbon I could touch" advance image/character/pressure. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (phosphoresce, sleeping vein). Propulsion clear to lantern closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gallery tiles as alphabet summons nomadic memories in interregnum, transforming survivor trope via walking method. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable penumbra/chess map inflections inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
