<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—preserve via mute gestures vs. risk of speaking like failed keepers—act in arranging hives and ellipse walk; final bow as earned renunciation carries visible cost of carrying weight without translation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from box opening to ellipse tracing as cadence shift reconfiguring covenant; closure's Charged Poise lands on-page in ghosts matching footsteps and softened heat shimmer with legible cost of unspoken burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring hives constrain choices as parentheses for box and evolve via ghosts along channels; scorched wasteland charges final image by slackening in response to ellipse, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to preserve unspoken tightens via deepening realization of covenant's breaking by speech, forcing mute endurance; cost unmistakable in bearing box "like a heart" after ghosts lift veils.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unspoken covenant emerges organically from combs as "viscous archive" and gestures' "scorch halos"; final "hives clicked yes" reweights listening over speech without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "hush between sounds" and selective noticing of scents/pressures; rhythmic texture modulates stillness to brief clover taste under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in lines like "brittle combs sealed with something that was almost honey and almost voice" propels without loops; figurative coherence peaks in "looped sentence whose grammar was breath and dust."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Beeswax-sealed box as breathing light and combs as unspoken archive transform ghost trope into fresh synthesis; risk of lyric ellipse heightens stakes in covenant retieing.</comment>
