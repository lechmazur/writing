<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veiled dreamer's cautious exuberance embodies contradictory impulses effectively through veil muting leaps and heart "tame and wild"; motivation to find unspoken words drives micro-choices like timing pulses; final responsibility earned without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of delays/patterns tightening to CR closure at ledger ("I was responsible for the second"), reweighting timeframe paradox with conceptual cost legible in looped delivery; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist/reeds constrain path via propagation delays; watch as micro-setting enables door entry when "outbound and inbound pulses met exactly on the reversed tick," charging final endurance image; sensory selection purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find/learn unspoken words) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through cipher obedience to entry/writing, narrowing options with patience cost; agency in documenting/timing forecloses naive certainty, charging paradox.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken meaning via delays emerges organically, reweighted non-literally in "speak by waiting...navigate by delays" realization; final letter loop offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mist timings ("fog...like handwriting erased and rewritten") and rhythmic modulation sustain single POV; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/scaffold; metaphors coherent and purposeful ("lanterned spine"); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion matches scene without overwriting in peak entry beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of delay-cipher navigation and self-authored time-loop transforms trope of mystical quest; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at ledger paradox.</comment>
