<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chaplain's motivation to transform apology into deeds drives micro-choices like crafting the heart and forming a concrete parole plan; internal conflict between mercy and trust earns the final renunciation of sermons with visible cost in sustained work. Mara applies relational pressure via questions that force clarification. Minor reflection summaries slightly dilute embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dialogue and repair density deepens stake from broken heart to ticking apology, culminating in Charged Poise CR where chaplain's report reconfigures as action plan; cost legible in "foreclosing" abstract praise with deeds. Orientation anchors in first paragraph; single scene causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain/storm and shop tools constrain repair choice and charge final image of thinning storm mirroring redemption; selective sensory hierarchy (ticking rain, glowing hush) reflects chaplain's perceptual bias toward mercy metaphors. Micro-setting (loupes, springs) guides actions tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem Hector via heart/action) signaled early, tightens via Mara's questions and repair success forcing plan crystallization; agency in chaplain's tactical shift to apprenticeship shows deepening under lens. Escalation coheres accumulatively; on-page cost in deeds over time unmistakable, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of deserving trust emerges organically from heart repair mirroring redemption, reweighted non-literally by final ticking lullaby and Mara's line equating intention to action; ambiguity lingers in forgiveness's reception. Protagonist arc inextricable from conceptual shift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (light/storm as mercy gauges) distinct and biased; dialogue subtextual (Mara's "how do you decide" pursues goal, reveals character idiom). Rhythmic modulation under realization builds to poised closure; no head-hopping, compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "Mara touched the broken tooth... smiled as the storm thinned"); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax embodies calm intensity. Minor figurative density ("dust itself remembered lullabies") risks coherence in opening but pattern-taught; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes chaplaincy, clockwork apology, and repair shop into inevitable redemption metaphor; risk-taking in poetic machinery/heart conceit transforms tropes, heightening stakes via irreplaceable "second opinion" frame charging closure organically.</comment>
