<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final protective act in lantern room earned by prior reticence and observant accumulation; contradictory reticence (warm observation vs. silence with Doyle) acts in scene without alternating summaries. Embodied emotion peaks concretely in "luminescent ache." Doyle's presence forces micro-choice of silence, revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of letters/stones builds to Charged Poise closure where jar's glow reconfigures automation threat with conceptual cost of intangibles preserved vs. archived. Orientation anchored early ("Briar Neck, haunted lantern room"). No shards; continuous window with legible reflections under BRR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lantern room constrains final choices (climbs after flicker, builds on floor); sea glass/stones as micro-settings charge closing image, mirroring internal ache through tactile use. Sensory selection POV-biased (panes "remember heat," tide's "cursive"). Details evolve causally (dusk pear/salt to moon through panes).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve ache/safety vs. automation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via letter density to final bottling that forecloses museum path with felt cost ("keep its promise from being put under glass"). Agency in stacking/oiling seals renunciation. Moral calculus between human breath and metal math legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of bottling human ache against mechanization emerges organically from letters/stones/images; final jar offers resonant non-literal answer ("light bottled out of breaths and hands") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in Doyle silence and sea glass reprise carries ambiguity of loss. No tidy resolution; ache lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("read the water, the gulls, the seams") biases details warmly; rhythmic modulation peaks in lantern room compression. Doyle dialogue natural/subtextual ("after the lamp flickers out"), advances stakes. Stable distance; no elision or hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers texture/pressure (e.g., "glowed with a luminescent ache" recharges motifs). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (lights "die like people," glass "green as old hunger"). Zero scaffold in peak closing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via letter chain as "phosphorescence," culminating in jar-lantern ingenuity; risk-taking in lyric accumulative voice heightens stakes of intangibles. Non-obvious synthesis of stones/letters/oil feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold tone sustains singular vision.</comment>
