<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the parley—Mara's commitment to unflattening records clashes with Esteban's plea for mercy—earning the final promise with embodied cost in the "aching" resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from diary touch to debris experiment to decryption, landing Charged Poise closure in "the past stopped shouting and started humming," with retrocognitive pain as felt cost on the exact final reading beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon doubles the debris cipher and charges the starlit final image, constraining decryption while mirroring internal tension; debris as micro-setting guides the experiment's tactics from above.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth in tension) tightens via parley revelation and debris arrangement under Accumulative lens, with agency in crate-lowering and promise forcing trade-off; cost legible in gondola rocking and tourniquet vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of frictional truth emerges organically from debris grammar and diary's betrayed names, answered non-literally in the humming past and star-confessions, reweighting righteousness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lines like "truth was a muscle and pain was how it learned to move" modulates rhythmically under stress; dialogue subtextual in Esteban's confession, voice coherent and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "debris messages settled into their patient grammar") propels without loops; minor metaphor density in retrocognition beat coherent and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of zeppelin archive, shore cipher, and retrocognition transforms discovery trope; risk in nonlinear visions heightens stakes, inevitable in debris-mirror payoff.</comment>
