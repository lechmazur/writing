<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in cautious hope amid ruthless tricksters, embodied in micro-choices like recruiting the team and handing headphones to the provost; final endurance of ongoing vigilance earned by prior preparations with felt communal cost. Interiority concrete and particular, no epiphanies unearned. Flaws balanced by genuine struggle against cosmic probes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from riddles to scaffold interference, pattern break at tricksters' squeal and dissonance wave, RR closure in dawn node vacancy filling with breath—cost legible in "healing is slower than harm." Orientation anchored early in midnight shift. Single scene coherent, lens unambiguous at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Studio smells of dust/coffee/solder, grimed charts, tower hum constrain choices (predict node, shape pulses) and charge final image of folding charts as sun rises. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (signal frost, subsonics in ribs/teeth). Atmosphere tensions ethereal/cosmic with gritty tech realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit tricksters fueling division) signaled early, escalates via scaffold under dissonance/breakers/provest—agency forecloses aggressive paths with cost in tripped breakers and "slower than harm." Accumulative deepening reweights communal pressure into conversations. One tightening sufficient, cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of leverage through listening emerges organically from scaffold disrupting power plays; final image of barricades loosening into conversations offers non-literal resonant answer to division vs. bridges, reweighting "ethereal grit" without moralizing. Subtext in images like mold/bruised fruit avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tricksters' "thin frost," "vacuum for boots") biases noticing toward signals/breaths; rhythmic modulation peaks in "room vibrates in our bones," stable first-person. Provost dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping, voice as character under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors consistent (spine-tower, river under floorboards) taught early, no loops/artifacts/muddle in climax squeal/breaker trip. Rhythm varies read-aloud, sentence variety supports beats. Zero scaffold in closure hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio tech vs. cosmic tricksters transforms tropes via subsonic scaffold and charts; risk in poetic voice heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in "make them notice their own breath." No derivatives, bold premise integrity.</comment>
