<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Translator's interiority is concrete and particular through embodied lens use; motivation to honor histories compels micro-choices like angling light over canvas. Elder applies relational pressure via probing question. Minor slip in overt articulation ("grief often arranges itself like weather") borders diagnostic but doesn't flatten peak discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via lens revelations (harbors, door, journal) to Charged Poise closure where market shifts and lens warms as "elusively tangible sun." Orientation anchored early in market/rooftops. Cost legible in "city catch[ing] on its own past."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (wind bells, cobalt hands, rescuing smoke) filtered through translator's bias toward hidden details; market ropes constrain movement, lens as micro-setting charges final image. No white-room; choreography coherent in stall actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor histories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through deepening discoveries narrowing to journal's "we stayed." Agency in repeated lens tilts; cost felt in emotional release ("ropes easing") but lacks sharper trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked labor emerges organically via named workers (Risa) and final "paths suspended"; resonant non-literal answer in "tide within a tide" reweights translation's cost without moralizing. Subtext in silences like elder's tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with distinct perceptual signature ("languages that caravans of light whisper"); stable distance modulates rhythmically under discoveries. Elder dialogue natural/subtextual ("what language I seek and why"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy revelations amid lyric flow); purposeful figuration taught early fits lyric mode. Minor deduction for two exact repeats ("hidden details in paintings," "elusively tangible") bordering loop in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical-realist translation via lens/paintings transforms trope of lost histories; risk in nonlinear reflections heightens resonance without gimmickry. Ingenious door-in-painting turn feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
