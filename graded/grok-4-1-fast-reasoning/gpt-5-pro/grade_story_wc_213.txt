<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Credibly curious trait embodied in rope-tension reading and sensor work drives internal conflict between oath and schedule; final renunciation of siren test feels earned with visible cost of potential backlash.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as microclimate details build to Charged Poise closure in "threw the switch to standby"; cost legible in foregone test and mountain's "shrug" reconfiguration sparing the tower.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sanctuary's rime powder and rope veins constrain zero-hour choice; sensory hierarchy via professional POV (anemometers, thermistors) charges final sway image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of listening vs. noise tightens via glue-dry wait and rope-hum cue, forcing agency in muffler/standby switch; cost felt in insulted-sky risk and bypassed ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-over-spectacle emerges organically from rope-as-witness actions; final "quiet crown the day" reweights hush as safety without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ropes hung like pale veins" and biased noticing of fiber hum; rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "zero hour" echoes and varied syntax propels under pressure; no loops dull "bell rope's clean, unstartled sway" closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of siren-testing via rope-microclimates transforms weather tropes; risk in lyric hush heightens stakes, inevitable in wind-braiding final image.</comment>
