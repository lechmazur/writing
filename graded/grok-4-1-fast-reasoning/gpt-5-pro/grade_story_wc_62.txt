<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship embodies grandmother's guidance concretely, pressing the shoulder in the first blow and culminating in her poem-advice to loosen the braid, earning the final carving choice with inherited patience as cost. Interiority particular via poem-recitals into leaves and ribbon translations, avoiding stock epiphanies. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously, tilting toward endurance over agonized conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon-tying builds braid density across voices, pattern break in untying ("loosen the braid, to let it fall open so the gaps could glow") delivers Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of endless grief in the receiving stone and return promise. Orientation anchors immediately in greenhouse/carver setup. Single scene coheres without shards or transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains via stalks/trellises for ribbons and fogged panes mirroring breath, charging final supper amid benches and radiant butterfly cloud. Sensory hierarchy meditative: creaking ribs, misting drops, damp lungs breathing approval. Butterflies evolve from gold roofs to charred leaves, mirroring grief arc without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape collective grief) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via intersecting ribbons and heaviest evening query, forcing untying renunciation with ongoing-loss cost legible in "no edge" and return vow. Townsfolk notes deepen without resolving. Agency in obedience forecloses tidy finish, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-braid emerges via particulars (ribbon crossings, poem coordinates), reweighting in final loosening where gaps glow, offering non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in spectral pauses and butterfly shivers invites ambiguity of endless renewal. Protagonist arc inextricable from collective voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice distinct in perceptual signature ("air itself lifted and folded"), modulating rhythm with meditative pauses and thunder blows. Compression taught early via poem-recitals pays off in closure image. No dialogue; POV stable, no elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels: multi-job lines like "sorrow grows where life insists on staying" integrate setting/motif. Rhythms vary read-aloud, syntax meditative yet propulsive; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak untying beat. Minor overwriting in stacked vehicles ("gentle thunder, a private storm under glass") but voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving as ribbon-braided grief in butterfly-greenhouse transforms tropes of loss into thundering calm renewal. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via poem-mentorship braid. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
