<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in "lotus-hearted ache" and micro-choices like selective copying of notes reveal contradictory impulses under mediation pressure; motivation rooted in own wounds earns final endurance of partial truths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from decoding to coral-sealed agreement; Charged Poise closure in "we all remembered" reconfigures stakes with cost of folded truths legible in "not every truth heals."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brain coral as micro-setting echoes grooves in notes and constrains reflection on stormpaths; charges final image when shown to auntie, recognizing encoded shore.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mediating Sifa's fate tightens accumulatively via decoded notes mapping safe handover; agency in selective translation forecloses full disclosure with felt cost in shared anxieties' mercy search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translation as graft emerges organically from cast decryption and coral reprise; final "graft holds because it drinks from both roots" resonates non-literally, reweighting wounds without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tidal/reef metaphors biases noticing to patterns under stress; stable first-person voice modulates rhythmically without slippage, supporting lyric accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (tides, reefs) propels via varied syntax; minor overwrite in decoding beat's stacked images ("ink run into blue veins") slightly dulls propulsion but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of cast as encoded map transforms conflict mediation trope; risk-taking in lyric decoding heightens stakes, with coral's shore encoding feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
