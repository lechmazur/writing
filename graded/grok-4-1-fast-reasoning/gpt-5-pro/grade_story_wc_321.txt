<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels in embodied sacrifice at closure—"I feel my feet thin into wake"—earned by resilient positivity and internal conflict between personal desire and civic duty, with the other self mirroring traits to heighten pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly to Charged Poise closure where narrator becomes "permanent transient," cost legible in "my name become the gap between whistles"; orientation anchored early via ferry routine, no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spectral grotto and starlight reflections constrain ritual choices, charging final image as "stars slide closed"; sensory weave (lapping water, glowing water) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fix vanishing ferry escalates texturally via pattern density in hourglass to single "road of light," forcing renunciation with agency in nodding and releasing knot; risk "one of us will be chosen" charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of heroic routine vs. personal arrival emerges organically from ferry specter and timeline merge, resonant CR in final bridge of motion reweighting sacrifice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tidal metaphors and echo diction sustains under ritual pressure; radio dialogue natural/subtextual, braiding voices intentionally at climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative patterns (echo ropes, star sieve) propels accumulatively, rhythm varies read-aloud; minor density overload in pattern-knotting beat slightly dulls peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry magical realism and timeline hinge transforms tropes via deckhand rituals; risk-taking in poetic structure heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
