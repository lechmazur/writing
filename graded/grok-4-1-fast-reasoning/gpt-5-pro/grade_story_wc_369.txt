<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation's tender stubbornness clashes beautifully with mundane role in micro-choices like scooping dream dust, earning hands-repaired realization; embodied ache in knees grounds ethereal interiority without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from ledger seams to roof query; Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in trees' "they hold them until we return," reweighting sorrow with patient-holding cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Trees' "green radiographs" and moonlight resealing constrain roof asking and charge bark-alignment image, filtering through maintenance bias; sensory mica-dust underfoot integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to query trees deepens texturally from pin-triangulation to sextant-tremble, narrowing to voiced ask with patience-drip cost; fragile-hour breath forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sorrow-to-soil degradation emerges implicitly via twig trade and "map would hold," reweighting healing premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct "interior weather" signature persists in storm compression ("pin... silver syllable"), modulating rhythm without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density propels via varied rhythm in "sound triangulate me, one vertex," coherent metaphors like "beaded curtain" untouched by overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sextant-to-sorrow-meter synthesis transforms maze tropes into tender tree-query, risking lyricism that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
