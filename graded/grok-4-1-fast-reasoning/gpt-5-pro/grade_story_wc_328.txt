<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in rubbing arrowhead for song amid bitterness and the sedimentality pun embodying laughter to avert breaking; final vow earned by causal buildup of micro-choices like scraping branch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density from phone static to pollen orbit to figure's emergence; Charged Poise closure in "cover metamorphose into a vow" with conceptual cost of arrowhead as tongue reweighting options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underground garden's dangling roots and orbiting pollen constrain choices (scrape willow for sparks) and charge final image (palm on soil promising compost); sensory selection reflects POV's plant-patience bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to trace harmony for Marko/city signaled early, escalates via agency-driven density (whisper to phone, pun) under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in self-forgiveness via "stupidest pun" and foreclosed bitterness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness-to-joke emerges implicitly via pun catalyzing shiver/figure; final cryptid charge "teach them to laugh where it hurts" resonantly reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "earth itself was a drum" and modulated rhythm under stress (short pun beat); stable first-person with purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops; figurative pattern (song/weave/hum) purposeful without muddle in peak pun moment, though heavy metaphors slightly thicken propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of pun as cosmic key unlocking cryptid harmony; bold risks in arrowhead-tongue payoff feel inevitable, transforming folklore tropes through lived frostbitten specificity.</comment>
