<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the machine climb ("hands wet and shaking... improvise a bridge"), earning final renunciation of certainty with shop's out-of-phase clocks as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fire-compass pattern builds density to CR closure in shop ("clocks... wrong just long enough to be right"), cost legible in foreclosed predictability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Slick ledge and cavern ribs constrain climb choices; luminous algae and corridor map charge final breathing-city image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pattern pressure accumulates to force improvisation at machine, narrowing certain habits with embodied risk ("fear thinned"); minor abstractness in early stake signaling tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Water clock and compass reweight timekeeping premise non-literally in final shop image ("not schedules, but cadences"), resonating without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Watchmaker perceptual signature shines in "screws became couplers, wire became tendon," rhythmic control holds under stress without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "water teeth engaged the wheel with patient bite" propels without loops or muddle; varied syntax breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Water-clock-as-metronome transforms artifact-quest trope into rhythmic CR; mosaic risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
