<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chef's ability to taste memories drives embodied conflict, clenching jaw at "the mason spoke at last, not words but a clean swallow without grit," earning final transformation without epiphanies. Contradictory impulses act in wrapping hands versus tasting ice; boy adds light crucible pressure. Exceptional under single-POV defaults; 9+ test met with scene impulses and causal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pools to pavilion cooking, closure as RR in "city felt less breakable" with tasted pains as cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words ("desert fortress after rain"); continuous arc fits defaults, no shards penalty. Waiver: disorienting dream opener pays off in final kiln-breath quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coral pavilion constrains cooking choice and charges closure steam "like banners after a siege"; sensory hierarchy chef-specific (petrichor/taste over sight). Details evolve causally (ice melts to brine); 9+ test met with object shaping final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sandpaper grief) signaled early, textural escalation via memory density ("tasted the siege... mason's silence") narrows to subsume choice; agency in ladling broth forecloses raw pain with jaw-clench cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending; 9+ test met with agency-driven deepening and page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of contagious grief transformed via tasting/cooking emerges organically; final recipe image ("Bring what you cannot say") resonates as non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars like ice "mineral of omission" build ambiguity; 9+ test met with reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (memories as flavors/weather); rhythmic diction modulates ("mouth began to flood") without slippage. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Stay"); 9+ test met with signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in cooking beat ("ladled in date sourness... bitterness loosened"); minor figurative density in descriptives ("slick filigrees") without muddle or loops. Rhythm varies; no artifacts dull closure "hands met hands, and no storm leaped."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, touch-grief, desert-ocean heresy feels inevitable; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes. Coral pavilion transforms tropes organically; no derivatives.</comment>
