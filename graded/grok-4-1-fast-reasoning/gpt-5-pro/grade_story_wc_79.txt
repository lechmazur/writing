<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied dread ("mouth taste of copper and prayers") driving micro-choices like whistle motifs; motivation roots in teacher's loss and intensifies patiently. Quietly driven trait constrains actions without overt conflict. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in revelation beat prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from maps to hexagons, culminating in CR closure ("knowledge stings and steadies") reweighting loss as safer waters with conceptual cost in "sunwashed dread like a cautionary map." One tightening via whistle alignment opens gate without force. Orientation anchored early in city/turtles/gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting vividly specific and purposeful: turtle shells as "furrowed desert" constrain stepping and whistling, charging final image of "pattern languages, each step a respectful echo." Sensory hierarchy via cartographer's pattern bias; barnacles/ropes evolve with rust/movement. Environment shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (question watchers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via whistle routes tightening to revelation/deepening that reweights expedition's loss with stinging cost. Agency in blowing/adjusting notes forces city movement and touch. Price legible in "cadence woven into backwash."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of maps as "songs humbly listening" emerges organically from pattern motifs shifting loss to integration; final image offers non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence/glare implies complexity of watchers' truths. Resonance from particulars like reed and shells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "pattern languages of light and sway"; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short notes in whistle progression). Stable single first-person POV with no leakage; purposeful compression taught early via maps pays off in hexagons.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sunlight sheets the back of an elder turtle, its shell ridges blazing like a furrowed desert" advances setting/action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Minor dense metaphors cohere via pattern motif without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Core premise of turtle-city/pattern communication fresh and synthesized organically; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes via watchers' abstract answer. Irreplaceable details like whistle/shell grammar transform tropes inevitably.</comment>
