<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lys's motivation to unmask the pretender intensifies through concrete micro-choices like seasoning lines with omissions and dipping the ink pellet, earning the climax line-drawing with felt cost to the pretender's history. Interiority embodied in perceptions like tannins biting paper; gardener's humility mirrors Lys without convergence. Minor flaw: pretender's traits vivid but secondary to Lys's arc, no deep contradiction shown in his final bow-out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of messages, pauses, and rune shifts build to on-page RR closure when Lys draws the line, sundering lacquer with legible cost in flaking signet and coughing books. Orientation anchored early in library and Lys's role; no debt. Structure coherent as one drifting scene; pretender's emergence from ledger shadow pays off pattern without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library as micro-setting constrains via shifting corridors and rune, charging final hum and stirring constellations; sensory details like ink puckering page and starlight bowls filter through Lys's priorities. Details evolve causally (corridors shrug loose); spatial choreography clear in mosaic guidance and ledger reveal. Environment mirrors internal truth-unveiling without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through message pattern to gathering and ledger confrontation, narrowing options via rune-timed pause; Lys's agency in cracking ledger and drawing line forces pretender's reconfiguration with visible cost (smile falls, signet flakes). One deepening sufficient; moral calculus in preserving dust over smooth narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth's bitterness vs. revisionist gloss emerges from ink vs. lavender erasures, dust knowing true names; final jarred signet as "Seasoning for future recipes" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting pretender's "improved story." Subtext in omissions and hovering letters; no moralizing, ambiguity in his graceful exit lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close to Lys stable, perceptual signature in constellation/dust metaphors biases toward subtle unravelings; voice modulates rhythmically with pressure (short sentences in shift: "The air thickened, stars arrested"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I have improved our story"); no head-hopping, elisions taught via pause pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Lys dipped the iron gall ink pellet in a bowl of starlight and drew a line through his title" advances action/image/theme); rhythm varies read-aloud, purposeful "graceful collapse" recurrence without loop. Minor figurative density in climax risks coherence (−0.3), but pattern-taught and closure clear; no scaffold or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drifting library as living archive where history edits physically via ink/rune; risk-taking in accumulative poetic structure heightens stakes of revelation without gimmickry. "Pause of shifting constellations" as timeframe ingeniously constraints tactics; no derivative echoes, inevitable hindsight in ledger minnows-to-bones turn.</comment>
