<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via embodied sensations like "thrum...in ankle, wrist, and teeth"; micro-choices (mending trough, brushing queen) reveal values under pressure, earning final endurance of carrying thrum onward with conceptual cost of unseen repetitions. Contradictory impulses subtle in testing vs. passivity, but hierarchy clear. No unearned epiphanies; voice specific to slow potter's perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via tests and braids to CR closure—"the sum of every time someone made a small repair...harden like glaze"—with undeniable conceptual cost of deferred outcomes. Orientation anchored early ("abandoned beekeeping oasis"); single scene coherent. Final image reconfigures premise with felt pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: mending trough with slip uncurls leaf; lantern glass/object-as-setting charges braids and final bowl placement. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (sun patterns, clay slip); phototropic oasis mirrors internal discovery. Wasteland/hives tactile and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand resistance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through tests narrowing to hour-specific braids and realization; agency in rituals forecloses forgetting with cost of unseen repairs. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in pulse accord. Subtle but legible under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resistance via "gentle repetitions" emerges organically from tests/images, resonant CR final image reweights without moralizing—"light turning kindly toward me." Particulars (Azra's bowl, mended trough) shift meaning; ambiguity lingers in phototropism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("slow enough to hear clay explaining itself") biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from observation to pulse crescendo. Stable first-person; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light like threads tugging at my wrists" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Figuratives purposeful/consistent (braids, glaze); no loops, scaffolds, or muddle in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phototropic kindness/fractured timelines via lantern glass transforms wasteland tropes; bold lyric risk (braided light as timelines) heightens stakes inevitably to CR. No derivatives; voice/setting cohere singularly.</comment>
