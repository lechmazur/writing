<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to discover beauty in the incomplete compels the rise after the snap and feather gift, earning closure via relational endurance with embodied cost in wet trousers; secondary boy/father apply pressure through vulnerability without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, kite snap inciting beat accumulates via mending intervention to charged poise RR closure where uneven kite rise reconfigures imperfection with felt conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reeds snag kite and serve as launch mast, constraining choices and charging final applause image; sensory details like "drizzle threads the warp" filter through poet's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of beauty in incomplete tightens accumulatively from snap blank to harmonized mend forcing trade-off of perfection for uneven rhythm; cost legible in kite's "laughing like a boat with one oar."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection's beauty emerges via feather's second life and final braid image reweighting prior observation without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("curves like a question") modulates rhythm under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via "work with this"; stable first-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwriting in snap beat ("sound blanks, as if the lagoon clamps its tongue") slightly muddles propulsion without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Feather-to-tail synthesis transforms kite trope via poet's lens into fresh imperfection cadence; risk of lyric mode heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
