<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Characterization excels in concrete interiority and micro-choices like whispering to bark under power falters, revealing hierarchy of values with endurance cost; motivation rooted in studious restraint compels persistence. Contradictory impulses (urge to shout vs. counted breaths) act in reflective shards, earning final renunciation of drama. Flawless under single-POV defaults, no safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dawn routines to power stutters, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("bind another sheaf... for the day the town remembers") with legible cost of fragile isolation. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (kiosk, bonsai maze post-silence). One tightening via faltering lamp reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and fluorescent hum constrain choices (walk paths to steady, chart variations) and charge final image (pages ferried leaf by leaf). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: sap fragrance over valley silence. Micro-setting (kettle, wind chime) integrates tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve time textures vs. encroaching silence) signaled early, escalates texturally via lamp stutter and maze gestures narrowing to endurance agency. One deepening (falters force whisper to trees) forecloses restoration fantasy with felt cost of "fragile hours." Closure Charged Poise reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of merciful invention emerges organically from charting hums into gilt-edged stories, resolving in resonant non-literal image ("handwriting waiting") that reweights loss without moralizing. Subtext in petal curls and dew refraction invites ambiguity on grief's patience. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light as confetti, hum as throat) biases noticing toward textures; rhythmic prose modulates from restraint to charged poise. Single-POV stable, no elision; syntax reflects mind under hush. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "charts peaks of memory, troughs of forgetting"). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor figurative density in peak ("sentences scarcely louder than grass") borders overwrite but pattern-taught, no loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes stationer with bonsai post-apocalypse into inevitable textural drive; risk in lyric endurance heightens stakes via invented histories. Fresh inflections like lamp-filament memory transform tropes organically, no derivatives.</comment>
