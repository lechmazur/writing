<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent motivation as shadow-conductor compels endurance with felt cost in final shadow role; interiority poetic but embodied in storm-attuned perceptions; minor slip in simultaneous contradictory impulses, more declarative than acted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure ("keep the strings visible"); cost legible in "someone must sit with the storm"; orientation anchored early in observatory/storm; one tightening via vault shadows reconfigures allegiance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico recurs to constrain cutters ("hummed like a whale skull") and charge final image ("spidered but standing, blue light smearing"); sensory hierarchy visionary-biased (lightning as "indigo ladders"); spatial coherence clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape dawn vs. council) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to Kestrel's halo burn and vault deepening that turns crowd; agency in threading shadows forces trade-off (I remains shadowed); cost visible in burn and batons-as-rain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of variant allegiance from shadows emerges via particulars (relic coat, lullabies), resonant non-literal answer in "shadows not as chains but as blueprints"; ambiguity lingers in "blinking is all change needs."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thunder that smelled like pennies," "lightning stitched silver seams"); rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable first-person POV with no leakage; purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm passes ear test; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("cracked moon," "paper storm crane") strains slightly but doesn't obscure closure; no loops, purposeful phrase returns ("fragmented radio frequencies").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-prophet myth in gritty storm-tech world transforms tropes; risk-taking voice heightens stakes (prophetic breakage); inevitable hindsight in Kestrel's rise from riddles.</comment>
