<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ilya's courtly mischief and cryptic explanations at the collectors' confrontation compel pivotal choices, earning the group's endurance; narrator's guard over defiance shows embodied contradiction in facing the Notice. Entomologist's subtle aid applies pressure without headcount blur. Closure renunciation feels motivated by prior sparks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from plant patterns to insect chaos, tightening at collectors' arrival into CR closure where shadows and pollen reprice taxable thoughts with humility cost. Orientation anchors early in greenhouse. One meaningful cadence shift suffices; collectors' retreat as Charged Poise lands on-page with conceptual cost in "owing only humility."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains via low heaters, mantises as "green knives," and vines into letters, charging climax chaos; gourd seed recurs to orchestrate ants' ellipsis on Notice. Sensory hierarchy (wet soil, hum) reflects defiance urgency. Recurrent objects mirror internal bloom, guiding choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of untaxed thoughts escalates accumulatively via Notice to collectors' incursion, narrowing to plant/ant shadow defiance that forces retreat trade-off. Agency in annotating with stems shows moral calculus between compliance and chaos. Climax cost legible in retreating "faces realized the math"; one tightening fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of "grammar for bodies under tariffs" emerges via petal arguments and root ledgers, resonating in final unbilled thoughts without moralizing. Sunflower shadows reweight premise non-literally. Subtext in vine ropes/tangles invites ambiguity on counting blooms; protagonist arc inextricable from defiance question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature ("ribs like slatted sunlight") biases toward pollinator fluency; poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure rhythm. Ilya's cryptic idiom distinct in dialogue like "annotate this with stems." No head-hopping; diction modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short chaotic sentences at collectors); high density in images like "moths rehearsed on the glass like tiny drummers." Minor overwrite in metaphor density ("candle in a storm," "nerves trying to whistle") during climax slightly muddles without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxable thoughts into plant semiotics transforms tropes via gourd metronome and shadow sentences; risk in converging chaos heightens stakes legibly. Premise implications followed without retreat, inevitable in hindsight via petal defiance.</comment>
