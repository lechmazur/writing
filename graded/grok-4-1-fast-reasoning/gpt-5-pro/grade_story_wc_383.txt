<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic's contradictory impulses—listening despite skepticism—act simultaneously in unsleeving the glass and questioning "Must I let you loose, or must I become the door?", earning the closure transformation with embodied cost in bones ringing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via resonance density building to RR/Charged Poise closure; "I open... Reina walks through me" reconfigures stance with legible conceptual cost in fear-nesting chord left behind; anchors clear by first stanza, continuous scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet garden and glass bell constrain pilgrimage to heart and archive aisles, mirroring internal quarantine; shell-as-micro-setting charges final niche placement, with sensory selection (breathing hedges, shivering marrows) biasing through keeper's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quarantining vs releasing memory signaled early tightens via shell-face revelation and vine-message "release, remember", forcing agency in arch placement; cost unmistakable in "solitude kept stiff furniture" yielding to passage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-to-independence emerges organically through resonance particulars, reweighting quarantine rule to "practice kindness" in dissolving sign; final image non-literally answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in resonance-noticing ("lattices carry meaning") and rhythmic modulation (short pressured lines at "I open"); stable first-person POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "vines, each leaf a tongue" advances setting/pressure/theme); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, coherent metaphors without muddle; no loops, minor figurative density pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quarantined echo/memory in surreal garden transforms tropes via resonance logic; bold lyric risk in "bones ring" and door-becoming heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
