<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses—oath to mercy amid steel arms and patrol risk—act in the climax confrontation, earning the leader's stand-down with visible vulnerability cost. Interiority particular via tessera visions grounding empathy. Leader's past-future depth adds crucible without headcount bloat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density from tessera visions builds to Charged Poise closure when patrol stands down, reconfiguring threat via renaming with felt risk cost in "he stares at my hands, sees the glass, thinks blade." Orientation anchored in opening plaza/ash. Single scene with taught past shards coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tessera and stepping stone constrain choices (visions enable renaming) and charge final warming image. Shattered sky/plaza rubble vivid, sensory selective (warm coldness settles between ash and wind), POV-biased toward memory cracks. Evolving details mirror internal states without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy vs. punishment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via leader's past vision narrowing options to renaming confrontation. Agency in kneeling/offering crystallizes stance with on-page cost (punishment hunger). Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges via renaming acts/images, final "I name the blue shard a bell... keeper of soft armored rooms" resonant non-literal reconfiguration of premise without moralizing. Particulars (figs, mother story) yield complexity, countering ledger mercy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (cracks as syllables, sky as peeled fruit) biases noticing toward renaming patterns. Voice rhythmic, modulates with pressure (short sentences in patrol arrival). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via mother's story evoking warmth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "sharp enough to make memory bleed" advances object/atmosphere/motif). Rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (plaza breath holds, time braid). Propulsion peaks cleanly in patrol beat without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognitive tessera enables renaming power in post-fire world, transforming tropes via cyborg empathy arms. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in patrol recognition from past shard.</comment>
