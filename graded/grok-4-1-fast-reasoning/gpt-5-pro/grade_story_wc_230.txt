<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rational forager's suspicion vs. virus-truth compulsion acts in eye trials ("words poured clear... edges rounded"), earning burial choice with cost of unaided trust; crew confessions reveal values hierarchy without diluting POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as relic acquisition, trials, and courier return accumulate density to CR closure (eye "tucked beneath a truffle bed"); orientation anchored early in ravine; cost legible in self-reliant "fractured grace".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains (roots for truffles, cables sway in storms) and charges final image (mycelium studies eye); sensory hierarchy (brine-slick leaves, drips) mirrors internal softening without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Safety stake signaled early tightens via eye's success then courier demand, forcing renunciation agency; under accumulative lens, density forecloses relic path with felt cost in "circle holds with fractured grace".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of merciful truth emerges via circle softening ("bark instead of knives"), final image reweights relic-dependence as unsustainable without stating moral; ambiguity in mycelium's "humble study" lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("methodical about spores... prizing clear evidence") biases nature filters; rhythmic prose modulates from rational logs to charged poise, stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "sentences that carried truth without cutting" layers voice/atmosphere); metaphors cohere in nature pattern without muddle; zero loops, varied rhythm charges closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of virus-truth world, relic-eye, and mycelial closure transforms tropes; risk in poetic rationality ("rational as rainfall") heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
