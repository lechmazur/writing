<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular ("stoically sensitive to the hairline tremors of silt and memory"); contradictory impulses act in scene via measured preservation against erasure; final endurance as "listening notation" earned by lineage of watchfulness, with embodied cost in "callused hands."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through note-placing ritual to Charged Poise closure ("I have joined its memory"); cost legible in final image of ongoing rowing as "steady ember"; orientation anchored early ("firm shore surveyor... drowning edge").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains choices (tide drops "to the waist of the columns" enables access); selective sensory details (steaming fissures, algae pennants) filter through POV bias; recurring columns/ledges charge final image of "drowned rehearsals."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve dreams vs. tidal erasure) signaled early, deepens via ritual acts under Textural lens; agency in micro-choices like prying seams forecloses passive measurement; cost felt in tide's return praising/erasing, shaping final commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence/presence emerges organically from note-placing amid columns' "interlaced absence"; final image ("interlaced absence we stitched will hold firm") reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of perpetual vigilance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("tide's mind is archival"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity (short sentences in actions like "I pry... wrest"); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "Paper crinkles within mortar beds, a small heartbeat sealed under weight"); no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful in lyric mode, charging closure ("work glows unseen like coals under river glass").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor as dream-archeologist in ritual preservation; bold lyric risk heightens stakes (notes vs. water's rewrite); final reconfiguration ("less man than listening notation") inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
