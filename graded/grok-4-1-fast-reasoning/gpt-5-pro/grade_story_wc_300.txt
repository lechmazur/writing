<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses peaking in the "heartbeat of a hesitation" where doctrine tugs against radiance-led action; final crowning choice earned by prior shell-reading causality with protocol cost. No stock phrasing; flaws like isolation complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from offerings to shell-reading to crowning RR (Charged Poise) with legible cost in empty tin and protocol break; orientation anchored early in descent/caves; single scene coherent, no ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain via dim lantern for hearing hush/crystals and stalagmite climb; charges final image as "mountain wore its new circlet"; sensory hierarchy POV-biased (radiance over seals), evolves with light-softened cracks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protocol vs. dissolve walls) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shell revelations to hesitation-crowning agency; cost unmistakable in softened door/people emerging and inspector's empty tin ticking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of radiance acquiring hopes emerges organically via pearl/shell/crown; final "empty tin... rhythm the city might slowly learn" offers resonant CR reweighting isolation to potential connection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (hush, radiance over steel); rhythmic control modulates from hush to thrum under crowning pressure; stable first-person, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., pool "quivered with a tone"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative consistency voice-motivated in lyric mode, clear propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pearl-crowning synthesis of inspector role and hopes transforms bunker trope into fresh radiance premise; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from shell inward spiral to communal thrum.</comment>
