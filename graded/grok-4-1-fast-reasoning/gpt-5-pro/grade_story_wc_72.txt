<question>1</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Narrator's motivation to thread nuance into certainty drives micro-choices like praising the tin fish and asking the bishop to release the ampoule, with embodied softening ("it did not break me; it softened my edges") showing internal change; voice specificity elevates without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations density-build to CR closure ("nuance walked in... threading strength through structural weakness until it sang"), with cost in unbraiding certainties legible in final image; orientation anchored early ("I am the living statue with telepathy"); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Underwater garden's cracks and currents constrain telepathic threading ("thought travels here through structural weakness"), charging closure as "plants remembered how to sway"; sensory selection (rust choir, sharpened silt) mirrors POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (welcoming nuance) deepens accumulatively via revelation density ("cascading revelations... as rain"), forcing agency in threading ampoule to bishop; cost felt in softened statues and released certainties at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of strength-through-weakness emerges organically from particulars (fissures as flutes, collapses as avenues), reweighting premise in final image ("rebuild... by listening") without moralizing; foxglove memory complicates care's misjudged dose.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tide hears me think like a choir of rust") stable in first-person POV, rhythm modulates with pressure (short incisives amid lyric swells); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies (long threads to sharp praises), density high, but minor metaphor churn ("threading... tugging... braided") and synonym loops on "revelations" dull peak slightly without obscuring closure; no scaffolds or artifacts in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue reviving drowned city via foxglove memory and weakness-flutes transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "city hummed... door unlatched."</comment>
