<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices like trembling hand and false starts reveal contradictory steadfastness under pressure; motivation rooted in father's death compels patient endurance with visible cost in final nod. Partner's pressure via signs and flinch forces her tactical resets. Minor abstraction in "oaths" fraying dilutes peak embodiment slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush builds density to "stifled buckle" capture, closure as Charged Poise in fob's ticking proof reconfigures gullibility with survivable cost on final shoreline walk. Orientation anchored early in market and fob. Single scene causality tight, no slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pier groans and eels constrain tactics (horn discourages bolt, hush truce); sensory hush layers (gull yawns, hook squeals) charge final "salt stayed in me." Micro-setting fob/pier mirrors internal fray. Specificity filters through her runner's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust break) signaled early, escalates texturally via multiplied false starts narrowing his mask to flinch; agency in stillness forecloses his bolt with boat horn complication. Cost legible in his "breathing unmoored" and her proof. One tightening sufficient, but minor abstract stakes in "future gullibility" softens peak viscerality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust's quiet wear emerges from hush gestures to "wore kindness until the last," resonant CR in fob holding "breathing door" reweights premise without moral. Subtext in signs and moonshine pour. No tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-centric noticing (nail collisions, buckle clench); rhythmic compression modulates with hush intensity. Sign-language as goal-driven action natural/subtextual. Stable first-person distance, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fob inhaled tiny collisions"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Purposeful metaphor pattern taught early avoids muddle, but minor synonym churn in "hush"/"stillness" loops slightly dulls mid-beats. No closure touch, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic-recording in silent market transforms betrayal trope; fob-as-shy-recorder and false-start erosion feel inevitable from opener. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes.</comment>
