<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in confessions ("I admit I documented... but never chained myself"), earning the endurance of tenuous renewal; distinct voices in sparse dialogue (Maro's joke, Keziah's widow tale) and embodied noticing (loaf's sesame whisper) reveal flaws under gentle pressure without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual layers build to Charged Poise/CR in final pocketed shell and seasonal vow, reweighting noticing into ongoing action; cost legible in "winter hardens everything" and "ability to notice together"; orientation anchored by ~line 5; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy, shells, tatami constrain gentle uncloaking choices per rules; final shell pocket charges image with restart cost; sensory hierarchy (cedar inhale, steam map) filters through noticer's bias, evolving causally (pre- to post-moon).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim sacred/ordinary vs. city forgetting) signaled early, accumulates through confessions' deepening (Maro's herbs, my delays); agency in visibility choice ("recloak... keep shells") crystallizes stance with official threat cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of active noticing vs. creeping subtraction emerges via particulars (planted crumbs, chalk/dew); final "action and attention stay married" reweights premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity in unfinished work without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in threshold-noticing ("every scratch... reports"); first-person stable, voice modulates rhythmically (short snip rhythm to confessional breath); dialogue subtextual/goal-pursuing (confessions test relief), natural idiom distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "snip, lift, thank, return" propels rhythmically); figurative pattern (uncloak, breathe) taught early without muddle; minor repetition purposeful for texture; no loops, clear propulsion to dew-edit close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla care/ritual transforms resistance tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes (gentle rules vs. officials); inevitable hindsight in chalk/dew revising name mirrors theme organically.</comment>
