<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied rituals like nesting jigsaw edges and tethering hair, revealing contradictory impulses (step through vs. preserve orchard). Final renunciation of self-passage earns closure choice with felt cost of tethering. Minor abstract summary in "Distance... stacked between two names" slightly dilutes embodiment without touching peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from silence fragments to frame humming, bead sliding through threshold (DC via sister's return reconfiguring hush into warmth). Closure lands on-page with patience cost ("seasons later... feeding lantern oil and patience"). Pattern taught early (jigsaw edges as threshold), no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bamboo whispers, moonbeams stippling fabric, and orchard's fruitless branches constrain choices (toll sensed, staying to preserve grove). Amber bead as micro-setting handled tactilely, charges final image (sister wearing it, smelling of rain). Sensory selection (clicking bamboo as "bones learning laughter") mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message across impossible distance) signaled early, deepens texturally via frame assembly and bead dispatch narrowing options (self vs. proxy). Escalation in "shimmer stood... urging her to thread herself farther" forces trade-off, with visible cost (tether, seasons of waiting). Minor abstract stakes phrasing holds from 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bridging silences through ritual emerges from particulars (jigsaw knives parting hush, bead ferrying breath), reweighted in final embrace (silence ferments into warmth). Resonant non-literal answer: "no longer raveling" recharges prior layers without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with weaving/thread perceptual signature consistent, modulating rhythm in peak ("breathed in, breathed out"). Stable single POV, no leakage; patterned elision (whispers into frame) taught early, legible at sister's footfall. Diction reflects spinner's idiom (unspool, bobbin) under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stoically sparkling" evokes bead's agency twice effectively). Varied rhythm, but minor overwrite in metaphor clusters ("knives... soft knives that parted hush") risks coherence in mid-build; no loops touch closure. Propulsion strong, ear-test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: jigsaw edges as silence-threshold transforms separation trope via rummage-sale specificity, inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes (latent sacrifice tugs). No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
