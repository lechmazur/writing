<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority via donor heart as "startled bird" and contradictory grief/hunger on silk map; dye master's pressure forces micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Final shift to "harbor" earned by causal buildup of heart's echoes. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wing demo to silk map to final path home, landing Charged Poise/CR closure where narrator's "fabric warmed" reconfigures heart-as-story-magnet with integration cost. Orientation anchored early in tea house arrival. One tightening via heart's "change stride" suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring wing and silk constrain choices (hold wing, read impressions) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (light skittering, stone-noon taste) reflects dye master's priorities. Spatial choreography clear via tether posts and slate. Environment evolves with sun trails crossing lines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnetize stories via new heart) signaled early, tightens texturally through deepening realizations (hearts "tuned to echo"); agency in listening/holding culminates in renunciation of lantern for lens with felt donor-laugh cost. Pressure coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of bending attention via "difficult angles" emerges organically from wing/silk demos, reweighted in final "harbor" image answering central question non-literally. Subtext in dye master's silences and implications avoids morals. Complexity lingers in donor integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light/sun trail motifs modulates with intensity; dialogue subtextual (e.g., "Your new rhythm is loud") pursues goals. Stable first-person with clean free indirect style. Rhythm compresses purposefully under realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Color lives in structure" advances theme/prose); varied syntax/rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or artifacts. Figurative coherence in wing's "breadthwise event." Propulsion peaks at silk words appearing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of transplant heart as story-collector with dye master's iridescent demos transforms introspection trope; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes via wing's viewer-dependence. Inevitable hindsight via sun trails home.</comment>
