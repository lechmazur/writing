<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to read scars evolves through embodied pain ("pain salts the floor with stars") and contradictory impulses (cutting vs. listening), culminating in an earned renunciation of cruelty with visible cost in the consensual elm wound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds from fern's map to ivy's demand and elm's yes, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where the scar "opens like a book that stays intact" with felt cost in the shared breath and lent miracle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower's roots, ivy, and elm constrain choices (must "read us first") and charge the final image ("windows glitter like healed skin"), with selective sensory details like "green rain" voice mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim miracle tightens via plant demands forcing consensual cut ("pocket knife kiss its bark"), with agency in tunneling and micro-choices narrowing options; cost legible in "sap rises like a sigh" and foreclosed cruelty path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reading scars without opening emerges organically from coffee rings to bark visions, reweighting premise in final image where memories "hold, because reading is not tearing"; no moralizing, resonant ambiguity in intact book scar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice with perceptual signature ("tables never lied") modulates rhythm under stress (short sentences in pain/tunnel beats); stable POV, purposeful compression taught early, elisions paid off in plant telepathy payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("meteor hush," "scar...like a parenthesis") varying rhythm without muddle; no loops or scaffolds, propulsion clear in sequence from rings to roots, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants and scar-reading transforms tropes via grounded lyricism; risk in poetic mode heightens stakes, with displaced miracle's organic logic feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
