<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's reckless idealist traits shine in soothing roots with lullaby despite bristling spines, embodying fiercely gentle contradiction; brother's laugh regrafting earns change with scar acceptance cost. Interiority concrete via thumb-tracing fissures. No unearned epiphanies flatten peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from roots' resistance to orchard-as-loom revelation; closure as Charged Poise in regraft and pledge lands on-page with legible scar/pledge cost ("let the roots read me"). Orientation anchors early in catacomb orchard. Lens holds seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots snaking bones constrain choices (catch ankles) and charge closure (pears exhale, threads fall); pear tree grafted into skull mirrors internal mending. Sensory hierarchy poetic via POV's tarry syllables. No white-room; lived-in tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to mend brother's destiny tightens via offering inlaying method, narrowing to scar acceptance; under Accumulative lens, density reweights with roots reading failures. Agency in scribing on bone/root forces trade-off. Cost visible in pledge never bargaining alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bartered destinies theme emerges via grafting exchange, resolved non-literally in orchard-as-loom where hunger asks kindly; final card cooling reweights prior fraying love. No moralizing; ambiguity in scars lingers authentically. Protagonist arc inextricable from mending question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature ("inlaying meaning everywhere fissures"); single POV stable, no leakage. Dialogue subtextual (Keeper's "barter more or complain"), goal-driven. Rhythm modulates from tension to resolve without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (stitching/breathing/grafting) taught early, propels via varied syntax; no loops or scaffolds dull closure ("his laugh ran clear"). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pears trembling. Zero muddle in regraft beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard market transforms bartering trope via inlaying on bone/root/air; fresh synthesis of debt/memory as living architecture feels inevitable. Risky lyric fantasy heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
