<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's anosmia roots concrete interiority and micro-choices like "map emotional terrain by rhythm and pause," earning the refusal to remove the screw; midwife's pride-fatigue reveals through embodied jaw-set; Master Isidor pressures via ledger nod without headcount blur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from stutter-drip to steady "forgiveness" Charged Poise; orientation anchors shop/POV by line 5; single scene causality intact, screw history as persistent constraint shapes tactics to closure cost of retained flaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Glass throats," "fogged dome," and "condensation stripes as rain script" constrain occluded repair choices and charge final tuned flow; morning fog micro-setting mirrors emotional hush, tactile drip hierarchy POV-specific without sensory checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix sans removal) signaled by midwife's whisper, tightens via "birth went wrong" nod forcing adjustment trade-off; lens escalation via deepening stutter-to-steady with history's felt cost; agency in wire-ease forecloses erasure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stitched time-quilt emerges from particulars like screw's "shrine" and "drops... like forgiveness," resonant non-literal close reweights stories-in-pauses without moralizing; subtext in shared breath-ripple avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias ("memory making a picture without odor") stable first-person, rhythmic modulation peaks in repair; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Time for a first cry"); no head-hopping, diction POV-lexicon apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in "exhale to fog... draw circles and lines" advances action/atmosphere; varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (water as speech); zero loops/artifacts, propulsion aligns with textural lens to mercy-image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Anosmic aromatherapist repairing clepsydra via birth-screw fuses healing tropes into fresh emotional terrain-map; risk of poetic compression pays off in inevitable "tiny applause" reconfiguration.</comment>
