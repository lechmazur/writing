<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in wrist scar and brother Fen intensifies through ritual micro-choices like ear-to-bark listening; embodied patience in "kneeling until the knees forgot complaint" reveals character under pressure without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to map print ("three silver lines that crossed near a ravine"); Charged Poise closure in tucking map and trudging east with "soft oath" carries felt endurance cost of years northbound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard constrains choices via hoarfrost gloss and snow grid-clearing, charging final image where "orchard seemed less dead"; body as micro-setting in frost-lashed stillness filters POV urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map Fen's heartbeat tightens via braided pulses converging on eastern rim direction; protagonist agency in flash-paper flares forces trade-off of remaining starlight, with physical kneeling cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembered light/heartbeats emerges organically from ritual particulars, reweighted in final "braid of heartbeats tightened into a road" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to waste/not-wasted via printed warmth on bark.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical sensory bias ("pulse could draw a road if trusted"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to aurora unfurl, with stable third-limited POV and purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "thread of safekept starlight bleed into the channels"; minor overwriting in stacked figures ("milk, but colder, pooling... winter riverbed") slightly muddles one peak beat but pattern pays off without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pulse-alchemy and starlight jar transforms quest trope into inevitable ritual cartography; risk-taking in textured hush heightens stakes, with heartbeat-map premise feeling non-obvious and closure-charging.</comment>
