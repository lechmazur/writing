<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied grief ("skin sings with luminous torment") and contradictory impulses (polish for patrons while own dreams circle refuse); final endurance earned as shadow returns, revealing balance-seeking motive with felt cost in transformed torment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from routine polishing to crane release; on-page RR closure ("my runaway shadow arrives, bearing the weight") with conceptual cost in reweighted light/loss knot, anchors clear by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (tea raked as steam into hull-cups, opal dew) constrains choices like path ascent/descent; recurring lanterns/opals charge final image, mirroring internal glare without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fold grief for shadow/Lio recovery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via keeper's thousand-crane theorem narrowing options; agency in folding/release forecloses untransformed grief with legible lighter/lower cost on basilica path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief into buoyant wings emerges organically from particulars (crease wing with grindstone-tingling finger); final CR reweights premise ("living is the art of folding brightness") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (brightness cuts as sorrow without edges); stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically under grief-stress, keeper's brief speech contrasts idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("polish, polish") propels via varied syntax; minor figurative density in peak ("shoal becoming a firmament") coherent but borders overwrite, no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream-gem recording and grief-cranes transforms loss tropes; risk in lyric ascent/descent frame heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via shadow's tender return.</comment>
