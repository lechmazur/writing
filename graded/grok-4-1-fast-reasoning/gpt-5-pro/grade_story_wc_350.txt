<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied traits like "hands smelled like brass and paper" root motivation in consistent empathy, driving micro-choices like pocketing the weight; councilman adds crucible pressure via glove discovery. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly undercuts peak agency, but final endurance feels earned without idealization. No diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of languages/sounds tightens from rumor to choir assembly; orientation anchored early via tower/elevator. Closure as Charged Poise in "bridge arced... children tested it like swallows" reconfigures silos into passage with felt sweat/lullaby cost. One meaningful deepening via councilman's glove unlatches refusal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via catwalk/plumb line and charges final image with clock's "soft cuckoo... blessing"; sensory hierarchy (brass smells, grain syllables) filters through Mara's choral bias. Atmosphere tensions hush with "creaked" grain ache; spatial choreography coherent in helical stairs to span.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate elevator into bridge) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via councilman's "no" to glove/joining under lens; agency in signaling choir narrows options with sweat cost. Pivotal tightening at "lifted a beam with us" forces crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of voices/seeds traveling emerges organically from grain talks/languages braiding into bridge; subtext in "no is a beat... beats are doors" invites ambiguity without morals. Final image "measure... by how many crossings hold" non-literally reweights hoard vs. passage, inextricable from Mara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "voice folded a room the way wheat bows"; rhythmic diction modulates from hush to "gears clicked like castanets." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("glove lay under bin three"); experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("climbed the helical stairs, pendulum shivering"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in stacked figures like "siloed organ, hoppers winded like lungs" risks muddle in mid-beats, but no loops and closure image clear; varied syntax supports poetic cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of talking elevator/choral languages transforms storage trope into passage via particular bridge-building; risk-taking in lyric grain-voice heightens stakes. Fresh angle inevitable in hindsight from "hello hello" multilingualism to "puente, bridge, mitawa, ours."</comment>
