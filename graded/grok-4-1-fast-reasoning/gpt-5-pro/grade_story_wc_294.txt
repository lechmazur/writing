<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses (line vs. inevitable circles) act in scene through bill placements and kid exchange, earning final walk with visible cost of perpetual orbit; interiority concrete and embodied in "polished calm" under memory pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught shards (father/startup/train) tightening to CR closure in "hold a polished calm and walk through the markers"; cost legible in final image of dark-carried train acceptance, orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned train's rust/wood/straw constrains choices (taping bills to doors/chair), filters via POV's marker obsession, charges final image; river dusk evolves with action, micro-objects (tin, bills) as setting alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover circling paths via markers) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through startup/father parallels to renunciation; agency in leaving bills forecloses isolation with felt loneliness cost, no reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of territorial orbits emerges organically from bill motifs shifting to "saints of paper," final CR reweights premise without moralizing—"greeting whoever waited" resonates as non-literal answer with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (loop-obsessed noticing) biases details character-specifically; dialogue natural/subtextual (kid's "thinking car" indirection); rhythm modulates from calm reflection to charged poise, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("paint peeled in scrolls") woven into action, varied rhythm propels; minor figurative density in reflective beats but coherent, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber geofences to train bills transforms tropes via "territorial markers"; risk-taking in lyric shards heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from circling pattern without derivatives.</comment>
