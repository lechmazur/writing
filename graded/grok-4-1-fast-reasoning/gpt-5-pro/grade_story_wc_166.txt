<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied motivation shines in "tides inside my bones" and micro-choices like dancing "where his gaze is not"; contradictory impulses act in solo-to-shared dance, earning watcher's palm-offer with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from solo practice to shared verse; Charged Poise closure in "harbor no law can close" reconfigures fidelity with exile cost, gaps constraining tactics page-wide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's gravel "remembers shoreline" and satellite passes constrain dance timing; twilight pools charge final dawn "tribunal" image, sensory details (brine, leaves) mirroring internal tides.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of forbidden verse tightens with watcher confrontation, agency in gap-dance forcing his doubt; deepening converts opposition, cost legible in his glove removal and shared exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of inner tides vs. decree emerges via gaps/silence ferrying syllables; final "step into our chosen night" non-literally answers without moral, reweighting ban through luminous scars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct tidal perceptual signature ("breath before a crest breaks") biases noticing; rhythmic syntax reflects dance cadence, dialogue subtextual in "forgets to speak" and quiet question.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "heel falls exactly where his gaze is not"; varied rhythm, coherent tide metaphors avoid muddle, zero loops even in peak dance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tide dancing post-nostalgia ban synthesizes fresh resistance via dust-speck verse; poetic gaps-risk heightens stakes, inevitable in "wings fledge, not to leave but to arrive."</comment>
