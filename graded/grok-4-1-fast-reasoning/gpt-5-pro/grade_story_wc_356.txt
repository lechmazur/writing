<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's olfactory sensitivity embodies motivation, driving micro-choices like swaying-platform planting and breath-guiding; internal endurance of village frowns earns final shared lesson without epiphanic overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds scent-layers and seasons to RR closure in "the crowd breathed with her, learning how a body could move without fleeing"; cost legible in stench confrontation, constraint in sway holds through.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Swaying platforms constrain hardest-sway planting choice; evolving smells from "whisper of mold" to "pepper, yeast, figs" charge bloom image, sensory bias via POV perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake of serenity-teaching via stench tightens through vigil to ceremony burst, agency in cedar-baskets positioning forces collective endurance with social-tolerance cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flower's "stench... divided into parts, until a small path appeared" reweights motion-premise non-literally, emerging from scent particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Olfactory perceptual signature ("nose could read weather, memory") and rhythmic hush-to-burst modulation sustain single-POV intimacy under bloom pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, varied syntax propels from "wildflower hush" to "burst... rank and huge"; purposeful metaphors consistent, zero loops or muddle in peak ceremony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corpse-flower serenity-lesson in treetop sway synthesizes fresh, stench-confrontation risk heightens stakes organically to village-body reconfiguration.</comment>
