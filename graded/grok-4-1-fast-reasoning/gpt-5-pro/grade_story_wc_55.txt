<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between singing dream and revered silence act simultaneously through embodied micro-choices like "stroked its lip the way the tide strokes a pier," earning final renunciation of ringing the bell with visible emotional cost in the reunion ledger entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from forecourt phrases to tremor-lengthened tone, delivering Charged Poise closure in "I bore it, as one bears a memory," with conceptual cost of transformed listening reweighting the premise on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choices by lending "s's and sh's" as guide for finger-stroking, charging final image; selective sensory details like "droplet wrote on it a barely visible line" mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dream-peace under hush tightens via density increase to "tone walking as if on snow," forcing gentle endurance that forecloses disruptive ringing; cost legible in "rusted into a lullaby" realization altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-moving-river emerges implicitly through particulars like rain-script commas, offering resonant non-literal answer in final bearing without moralizing; epiphany earned via struggle, reweighting hush with undeniable acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("every storm dragged music to the threshold") biases noticing toward hush and breath, with rhythmic modulation under pressure; purposeful compression taught early remains legible to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("a tremor answered, so soft it could have been imagined"); purposeful repetition of "hush" and "gentle" taught as pattern without loops, no figurative muddle in peak tremor beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock scribe crafting mercy-mathematics transforms silence trope through irreplaceable particulars like fused-sand bell; bold lyric risks heighten stakes in glacial hush premise without gimmickry.</comment>
