<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses shine in the untangling scene, where actions reveal stubborn resolve against "fogbones," earning the final vocational shift; minor diagnostic phrasing like "vocation again" slightly abstracts peak motivation without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via image density building to resonant reconfiguration in the beam's "measured kindness" crowning the lens, with legible cost in foreclosed "walls close in"; orientation anchored immediately, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse micro-setting constrains pivotal untangling via "shutter ropes braided with nets," charging final image of "room seemed to open inside her"; sensory hierarchy (fog, dust sentences, storm harp) filtered through artist's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redesigning sight escalates accumulatively through descent and knot-naming under storm pressure, agency in "gently, naming each loop" narrowing to beam release with felt internal cost; one decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honoring fragmentation emerges organically via tarot map and lighthouse metaphor, resonant non-literal answer in final portraits as "constellation of tides" reweighting ache without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("dust bodied itself into sentences") modulates rhythmically with pressure, stable single-POV distance; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and rhythmic phrasing, but dense figuratives in climax ("heart thudding... fog listened") border overwriting without muddle; no loops, clear cause/effect in untangling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot-as-map guiding lighthouse repair transforms artist-block trope, with bold risks in synesthetic imagery heightening stakes organically to inevitable closure reconfiguration.</comment>
