<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Repairman's "wilts near dishonesty" trait concretely constrains actions, as knees soften at constable's smile and room blooms post-elders' admission, earning final compromise choice with visible cost to his respect for oaths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening to Charged Poise closure: elders amend oath after light return, reconfiguring balance with conceptual cost of "honest compromise hammered thin like leaf"; orientation anchors early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber and midnight town as micro-settings constrain via sound-filaments guiding entry and lamps' fear-stakes forcing mending; recurring drum/tether charges final image of light settling "like oil that smells of apples."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates accumulatively via density shift from bruise in harmonics to hinge-mending reversal under constable pressure, forcing renunciation of non-interference with on-page cost of potential wilt and oath tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of honest renewal amid entropy emerges organically from rust covenant's admission and light's return, with final image resonantly reweighting decay as "what returns to breathe holds time more gently" sans moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward harmonics ("vacancy shaped like a note") and modulates rhythm with pressure; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "turning a page underwater") propels without loops, though occasional figurative stacking in descriptive beats borders overwrite; closure image clear and rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repairman mythos with rust oath and "mending what isn't torn" transforms entropy tropes, risking poetic conceit that heightens stakes via irreplaceable sound/light logic to inevitable tinkersong close.</comment>
