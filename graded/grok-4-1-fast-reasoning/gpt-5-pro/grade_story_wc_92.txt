<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional single-POV interiority with embodied contradiction ("fear tries to giggle" vs. "calmly inventive") driving micro-choices like quill use; final shift to "also a hinge" earned by prior causality with visible cost in softer vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final image ("city turned quietly on that hinge"); cost legible in subtle revolution's risk vs. shout; orientation anchored early ("luminous fort at twilight"); one tightening via wheel activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial and archive seam constrain choices (patrol avoidance, seam press); quill holder as micro-setting charges final image; sensory selection (metal "stuttered") POV-biased and purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via blackout density to light-spread cadence shift narrowing to subtle permission; agency in inventive fix forecloses violent path with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet permission emerges organically from particulars (doors opening, hands as lanterns); final image reconfigures light/magistrates without moral, reweighting prior hush with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (metal anthropomorphized consistently) with rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable first-person POV; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative language in most climax sentences ("light tasted the room first, polite at the lips") borders overwrite without muddle; no loops, strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic revolution via speaking metal and quill-bridge; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight without derivative tropes.</comment>
