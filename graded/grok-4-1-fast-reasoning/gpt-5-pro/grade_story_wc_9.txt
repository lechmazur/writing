<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied, with contradictory joy/dread braiding into micro-choices like tracing the palm-doorway; final promises earn change via prior time-wasting flaw, with visible cost in foreclosed hours.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to card-spread reservoir and cloud-gathering; closure as Charged Poise in palm-resizing pour, cost legible in "widening, as if making room for the fist" with promised sacrifices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory selection purposeful (pine honey as warning/prayer) and POV-biased; glade/clouds constrain path-stepping choice, saucer charges final pour-image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover lost time) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via card-reveal to promise-costs filling saucer; agency in gathering forecloses carefree hours, cost felt in specific trades like "an hour without a phone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time-repentance emerges organically from hand-traces and minute-catching; final baby-hand overlay resonant non-literal answer to perplexity braid, reweighting abundance illusion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (onyx blacker than needles) modulates rhythm with pressure; purposeful compression taught early, stable distance pays off in choked-beauty closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, metaphors coherent/patterned (crack as healed scar); minor overwriting in glade-beats borders density excess but serves lyric propulsion without obscuring pour-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy-time-harvest post-birth transforms trope via saucer-minute physics; risk in cloud-ravine path heightens stakes, inevitable in handprint-palimpsest hindsight.</comment>
