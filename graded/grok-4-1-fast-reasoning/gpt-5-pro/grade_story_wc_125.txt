<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in choosing poem over map trade, earned by prior ethical playfulness and layering motif; escapee and visitors apply crucible pressure without voice convergence. Interiority concrete via "pockets of ash" and rope's "bright fatigue."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to hush-filled closure (rope straightens, second thins); on-page Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (foregone map sight for layered time) legible in "rope shudders, pulling on years." Orientation anchored early in grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto, whale mural, and rope constrain choices (rope through ribs releases); starlit cliffs and sea hum charge final "mobile sky of knots" image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific (tender static, clay ribs).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture via impossible choices) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in hush/grotto deepening and poem trade that forecloses blind travel; agency in knot-braiding/endurance crystallizes stance with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of layered time emerges organically via rope/whale evolution, resonant non-literal answer in "texture of time... mercifully various"; ambiguity lingers without moralizing, reweights escapee's "perfect... moment."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("highways hum," "star pit") and rhythmic modulation under hush pressure; first-person stable, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("show me... second").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rope straightens, pointing as a diviner points"); no loops/artifacts, figurative language pattern-taught early in lyric mode, propels to "road calls like a conch."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of energy beings, time-prison, and poet's knots transforms escape trope; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable in "patience with passionate subtlety" closure.</comment>
