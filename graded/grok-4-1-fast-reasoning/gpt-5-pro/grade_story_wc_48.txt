<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene, as admitting the storm's quieting to the girl reveals mercy as erasure, compelling the closure choice to solemnize parting with earned forgiveness and visible cost in shaking legs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of cameos tightening to nexus opening "like an eye," delivering Charged Poise closure via kneeling and truth-telling at the circle, with grief/gratitude cost legible in the braided surge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring seashell constrains choices (holds star/knot, pressed to ear) and charges final ring image; mist and pages evolve causally, mirroring internal states through tactile wading that narrows to shore.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to collect hopes escalates via cameo pressures and deepening wade against current, protagonist agency in placing fragment forecloses erasure path with on-page cost of "legs...shaking" and braided emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of shell ringing reconfigures "against the current" theme non-literally, answering how to solemnize via lanterns released upstream, emerging organically from cameo particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (vines as cursive, pages as fog) with rhythmic control modulating from swirling hush to stillness; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but dense figurative layering in nexus peak ("wolves of ink padded the margins") borders overwrite without muddle or loop, preserving closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bold surreal synthesis of writing as river/nexus transforms abandonment trope, with cameo hopes and shell ring feeling inevitable; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
