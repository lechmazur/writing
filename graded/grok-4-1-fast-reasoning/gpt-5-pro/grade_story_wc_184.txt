<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like tracing braid then checking pulse against pendulum swing, reveal hierarchy of values; motivation intensifies credibly to compel reconfiguration. Minor over-articulation of traits ("warmly methodical") borders on label-speak but doesn't flatten pivotal rope beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via pattern matches (rope to seal) tightening to cadence shift at bell's "clarified hour"; on-page RR closure (door retires into brick) with conceptual cost of restored "stuck week" legible in dust path and vellum relaxation. Orientation anchored early; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mechanism room micro-setting constrains choices (gears leaned into, thrum against forearms during reconfiguration) and charges final image; sensory details (metal/dust breath, fibers remembering hands) filtered through archivist's pattern bias. Body as setting (pulse vs. swing) elevates pivotal alignment beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve schedules' contradiction) signaled early, deepens via braid-map realization narrowing options to reconfiguration; agency in "tightened and loosened in sequence" forecloses misalignment path with felt cost (door "finishing a word"). Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of naming absence emerges organically from particulars (fables curl like smoke, space around facts); final image (door retires "when clarity takes the air") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moral. Rope motif shifts from ceremonial to mechanical map, charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("patterns as if they are weather for the mind") and rhythmic control (varied syntax in peak reconfiguration) heighten pressure; single POV stable, voice modulates from "warmed my hands and thoughts" to "steady and warmed by the bell's echo."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "braids formed a pattern I knew from the archive's margins" advances plot/character); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, minor "checked/traced" repetition purposeful in methodical buildup. No loops or muddle touch closure bell-ring beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival pattern-reading into clock-tower puzzle transforms magical-door trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via rope mechanics without obscuring clarity or closure. Inevitable hindsight from seal-rope braid match.</comment>
