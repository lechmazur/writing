<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's quietly rebellious trait compels persistent drumming and consent despite blur risk, with embodied contradictions like "auroral sorrow, beautiful and breaking." Interiority particular via synesthetic perceptions (metallic/sweet air). Final endurance earned by prior micro-choices, foreclosing self-clarity with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from shy garden phrase to lagoon flicker to memory collision, tightening via consent ("tapping yes") into Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early in garden/clinic. Cost legible in "outline blurred" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's frequencies respond to drumming, constraining tactics (benches quiver, railings throb) and charging final "gentlest gold" fade. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (tastes brine/electricity under stress). Micro-setting (lagoon ripples) mirrors internal entanglement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (braid memories for Jonah) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to hour's shared joy then thinning sparks, narrowing via consent trade-off. Agency in drumming/knuckles drives deepening. Cost unmistakable in "we might wake neither in flesh but as a chord."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared dream's cost emerges via particulars (thorns snag unrealized days), reweighted in final lantern image without moralizing. Subtext in rhythm-promise vs. blur friction. Resonant non-literal answer: oxygen for frail dream over fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sounds bloom terrains, weather in skull) biases toward rhythms/memories. Voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose as character in drumming syntax. Lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in varying rhythms (short punchy consents amid lyrical swells); purposeful metaphors cohere (aurora drowned in basin). Minor overwrite in opening petals/thoughts simile stack, but pattern pays off without obscuring peak collision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-drumming entangles memories in responsive garden, transforming sci-fi trope via rhythmic rebellion. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in "drumming tomorrow on ribs." Bold, non-obvious premise commitment.</comment>
