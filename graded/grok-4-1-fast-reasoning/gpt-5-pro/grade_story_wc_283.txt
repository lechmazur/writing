<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to "spin a prophecy into raw possibility" roots in childhood listening and drives micro-choices like cataloging buttons, culminating in earned collective shift; contradictory impulses between individual practice and "bigger story" act in scene without abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build density from buttons to spiral-echo revelation to collective turning, landing CR closure where "a seam opens" reprices prophecy with collective cost; orientation anchored immediately in warehouse/cliffs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Honeyed light, shelves "like ribs," canyon echo jar constrain choices—unsealed to flare memories—and charge final warehouse image as "heavier and brighter"; tactile handling of buttons/hourglasses evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake against surrender tightens accumulatively via pattern hum to echo's "withheld sentence," forcing protagonist's bell-ringing agency; cost legible in wary town response and path's opening as shared trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shared wisdom emerges organically from buttons' "ledger" to collective stitching/turning, repricing prophecy as "thread we can keep choosing"; final image resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cloth/time/sound metaphors ("sand is a choir") modulates rhythmically under pressure; single POV stable, sparse dialogue ("how I knew") natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors, but minor overwrite in climax ("sound empties... striking the spiral") slightly muddles propulsion; no loops, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Buttons-as-constellations mapping prophecy reweave transforms folklore tropes into fresh synthesis; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in rain-road CR without gimmickry.</comment>
