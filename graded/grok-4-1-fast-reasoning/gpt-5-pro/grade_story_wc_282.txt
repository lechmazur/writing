<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional single-POV interiority with embodied emotions (thermal bloom of longing) and micro-choices under pressure (following sorrow despite fear), earning the final broadcast renunciation with visible personal cost; no diagnostic labels or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to chamber discovery and CR closure in threading the chord (reweights mapping into invitation with half-truth cost legible in final log); orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cave micro-setting constrains choices (tight elbow, surge) and charges final image via fossil alignment; sensory hierarchy (salt, peat, drips) reflects POV priorities without checklists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voicing unknown) tightens via chamber deepening (sorrow lane to chord), protagonist agency in pressing fossil forecloses safe metrics for invitations; cost unmistakable in surge weightlessness and logged half-truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of bridges across epochs/minds emerges organically from fossil-chord resonance, final image offers non-literal answer (map that speaks) reweighting particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sensory pressures, limbic heat) with rhythmic control modulating to peak stress (spinning with shadows); stable first-person, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (dripping language of intervals), varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffolds; purposeful lyric figures integrate without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hibernation world, sensory tech, and fossil bridges transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
