<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the scene, as the narrator catalogs thresholds ("a crab molting... a trust unspooling") instead of answering directly, earning the final agreement to "cross this mouth of water"; relationship with "you" as teacher forces micro-choices that reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through observations to Charged Poise closure in the tide turning and shared vow; cost legible in "risk the shore breaking" echoed to end; orientation anchored immediately in grotto and pools.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal pools and grotto constrain choices (e.g., "pools write their stories on its green glaze," tide "offered our ankles a cool vow"), charging final image of palm to wall and tide turn; sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stay/leave) signaled in "whether I would stay, or finally leave," deepens accumulatively via tangential catalogs narrowing to "I do not choose tonight, but I agree to cross"; agency in refusal/endurance forecloses direct resolution with relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transitions emerges organically from particulars like cicada and tides, reweighted in final "leaving is a form of arrival" without statement; resonant non-literal answer in scallop's edge and migrations in stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in nature-tinged diction ("light skimming barnacles," "night inch its own grammar") modulates rhythm with pressure; stable first-person with no leakage; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors building texture; no loops or artifacts, though minor figurative density in reflections taught early and pays off; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicling and jade cicada transforms stay/leave trope into textured time discovery; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
