<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation as tender bridge-burner compels choices like sharing scars, earning visitor's release; embodied via ribs' "map of old fires." Minor slip: visitor's "shame suffocates" borders label-speak without deeper contradiction shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to breathing ritual to departure's Charged Poise RR; cost legible in "hand fell from the hinge scar, and the room brightened." Orientation anchored early in sanctuary/starlight; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ash, starlight dust, doorknocker constrain ritual choices and charge final image of "rain over spent coals"; selective sensory weave (sound sinking, walls as lips) mirrors breath stakes without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching breath) signaled early, escalates via failed stays/tremor to agency-driven release; cost felt in Keeper's "old fires" and visitor's scar-drop under lens cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of care as measured blaze emerges organically via bridges/breath images, resonant in final "pulse I did not have to supply alone" reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows gathered like attendants") and rhythmic modulation sustain first-person lyric POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Show me how to breathe").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels with high density; minor overwrite in breathing beat's pervasive figures ("ladle striking a well," "surf...forgotten the sea") dulls peak slightly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ruin-as-school mentoring via ash/scar poetics; risk-taking voice transforms therapy trope, inevitable in "safe embers with stars" hindsight.</comment>
