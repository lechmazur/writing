<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory rage/patience tugs in sluice revelation foreclose rash action for colder strategy, earning final stance; watchman adds crucible pressure via key and siren without depth slips touching closure. Interiority concrete via sundial "second pulse"; micro-choices like rearranging scene reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from poling to crates to siren blast reconfiguring lies into public verdict; Charged Poise closure in "paperwork crossed town like a weather front" with conceptual cost of exposure undeniable. Single scene causality tight, no orientation debt; sundial scratches causal pivot legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Canal reeds, sluice gates, skiff constrain choices (aligning sundial, hauling crates); sundial charges final shadow "verdict across logo." Sensory selective via POV (radio static hush, loaf wrapper hunger); micro-setting lived-in without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose flood orchestration) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative lens: sluice scars tighten to foreman confrontation, siren publicizes with agency in restraint ("did not run fast"). Cost legible in foreman's lowered stance and neighbors' listening thread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of lies' architecture emerges via particulars (sandbags one side, siren parts); final "courage to name currents by their makers" non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in watchman's laugh "like rope sliding"; ambiguity in truth's limits lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sun writes marginalia") and rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences at foreman arrival); dialogue sparse/natural with subtext ("you still reading the sun underground?"). POV stable first-person, no leakage; voice poetic but legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (long poetic opens to crisp climax action); high density in "scratches matched ledger initials" multi-jobs. Minor figurative density ("heron landing, sudden and weightless") in revelation beat borders overwrite but patterns via light motifs without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial-as-compass transforms detective trope into poetic truth-seeking; serene upheaval tone risks lyrical compression that heightens stakes via canal constraints. Fresh synthesis of flood conspiracy and marginalia verdict inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
