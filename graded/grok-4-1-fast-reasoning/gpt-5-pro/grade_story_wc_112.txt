<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hale's motivation to prove sideways time roots in embodied past ("landed uninjured between seconds") and compels micro-choices like lever notch and easing back with restraint cost. Sera's questions force clarifying stakes without dominating. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak proof moment, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to nexus gathering, plane sketching dreams laterally. Closure as Charged Poise in "eased the lever back a breath... without the pull of his proof," reconfiguring options with felt restraint cost. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Xenobiology station and roost constrain choices (early safer, pin drifting nexus); gliders' tendons and chevrons on snow charge final settling image. Sensory hierarchy (hush, deep tone through arms) reflects Hale's priorities. Micro-setting (lever, lattice) evolves causally, mirrors internal tilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, tightens via lever pull yielding hatchling's tomorrow and bird's three-minutes-ago stir under Accum lens. Agency in adjustments narrows to gentle success; cost legible in eased lever foregoing full pull. Minor abstractness in signatures prevents higher band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gentle sideways dawn emerges via gliders' dream gradients and Sera's "care is the sharpest instrument," resonant in final thanks to flock. Returning "sideways" reweights premise without statement. Ambiguity in proof's cost lingers honestly; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (mechanic's rivet-wing hands, listens for sideways grain). Voice texture modulates poetically yet legibly, taught early; dialogue subtextual ("Early is safer... move like snow"). Diction/rhythm heightens nexus hush without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (long vowels, lattice kindles); metaphors consistent in lyric pattern taught early, payoff in angular river. Minor figurative density in proof beat ("light interference sketched... patient sliding echo") borders overwriting but doesn't obscure closure. No loops; varied syntax propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenogliders' dreams proving sideways time via holographic nexus transforms sci-fi tropes organically. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in nexus pinning; final reconfiguration ("thanked the flock for lending... sideways minutes") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
