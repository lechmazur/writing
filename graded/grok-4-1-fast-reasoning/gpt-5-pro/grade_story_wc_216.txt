<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to grasp time's texture drives concrete micro-choices like embedding messages and touching the capsule, with embodied contradiction in "ribs answered with a hopeful ache." Final stewardship realization earns closure via prior debt-paying buildup, revealing character limits without safety-hedging. Mara applies relational pressure as crucible, her urn fragment forcing the seam's unlock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garage-sale breadcrumbs to capsule opening and ribbon uncoiling, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where time reconfigures as "weave and grain" with cost of returning "borrowed coins." Orientation anchors early ("after numbers change meaning," "emerald silo beyond the rye"). No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in "silo felt suddenly timeless again."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "minutes taste like copper," "air...full of waiting, like a held chord" filter through POV's textural bias, constraining choices (urn fits warped seam in glassy tower). Emerald silo's "green light" and "watery heartbeat" charge final exhale of "old weather." Micro-setting (capsule as "grounded comet") mirrors internal nap/friction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) signaled early, tightens via urn-enabled opening and self-ribbon revelation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to debt-payment with "tender I could not replicate." Agency in pressing fragment and releasing coins forecloses survival-only path, cost felt in "borrowed heartbeats lining my ribs like foreign coins."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as textured stewardship emerges organically from ribbon's future-self instructions and coin-return, reweighting numeral-loss premise without statement. Final image ("walk home lighter, counting by touch") offers non-literal resonance to central question, charging prior garage-sale method with ongoing repair ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("textures and debts with a slower hand," "hours collect like dust") biases noticing toward synesthetic grain, stable first-person POV with rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in silo opening). Lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's "held chord" poise; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "It clicked like bone understanding bone, and the seam loosened"); figurative pattern ("tastes," "hums," "weave") taught in opening coheres without muddle. Varied rhythm propels to closure; zero loops or scaffolds, precise causality in sequential actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-numerical world via adjective-maps in garage sales transforms time-trope into textural stakes, with ribbon's future loop risking bold circularity that heightens closure ingenuity. No derivative echoes; premise implications (avoiding arithmetic) followed fully.</comment>
