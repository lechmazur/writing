<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—facing shadow's hunger yet offering kindness through stone and archive—act in scene, earning the final inscription with embodied cost in warmed palms. Shadow as foil applies relational pressure, revealing narrator's blind spot to shared grief via recurring hand in reels. Exceptional under single-POV defaults; motivation intensifies via micro-choices like pausing frames.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from catalog chime to shadow pouring yearning, culminating in RR (shadow bound to kindness) with legible cost in "palms still warmed by stone and the hush." Orientation anchored early ("blooming library above clouds...dusk"); one tightening via shelves quivering as shadow leans forward reweights stake without contradiction. Closure image reconfigures absence to preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>River stone as micro-setting constrains choices (tether against billow) and charges final image ("palms still warmed"), integrated tactilely with POV bias (mica like trapped moon). Sensory hierarchy selective: ozone/thunder narrows under shadow pressure; pollen release mirrors internal shift. Environment evolves causally (cloud floor tilts), guiding inscription without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catalog/soothe shadow's ache) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening (archive reveals hand's yearning, shadow gathers glints) narrowing to preserve hope over escape. Agency in screening reels and inscribing spine forecloses absence with felt cost ("weak thrum...iron tang"). Coherent pressure under lens forces crystallization in bound book.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-witnessed hope emerges organically from stone-reel circuit and shadow's lilac-named ache, reweighting loss via final image of flowering shelf/book without moralizing. Subtext in silence (no sound, only grain) and implication charges closure; ambiguity lingers in "griefs drift forever, but this one settles." Protagonist arc inextricable from preservation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer" filtering petals/ozone); voice texture modulates rhythmically from deliberate steps to held breath under stress. Lyrical compression taught early pays off legibly at closure; no head-hopping, inference matches knowledge (shadow's flicker as creek memory). Prose as character: syntax reflects poised witness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "It gathers glints from the mica, gathers dusk...gathers courage" propels via anaphora); rhythm varies read-aloud without loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherent/pattern-taught (blooming spines pricked by longings); no muddle, overwriting, or template cadence in peak (shadow leaning). Propulsion peaks in "pours its yearning into my open hands."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes dream-library with unbound shadows into fresh dusk-noticer frame; tropes (grief-shadows) transformed via shareable dreams/reels. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes (shadow's hunger vs. catalog), inevitable in hindsight via stone's circuit. No derivatives; bold petal-cloud setting coheres as singular vision.</comment>
