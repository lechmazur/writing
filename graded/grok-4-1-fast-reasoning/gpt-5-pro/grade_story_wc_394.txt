<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied ("itch behind my teeth," "knuckles into levers"); contradictory impulses (allergic to sense yet awed) act in scene, final endurance of inward path earned by prior risks like riding drafts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from clue to ringing ("something rang like basalt deciding to become a bird") to Charged Poise of inward map; cost legible in unheard ring's unlonely punchline, options reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid sea extrudes towers, chews thoughts, constrains glider rides and spindle ascent; kaleidoscope as micro-setting charges transliteration and final blossoming grammar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ring unheard bell) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via algorithm's hiccuped map to surge at summit; agency in slotting tip forecloses outward path with felt risk cost, though quiet persistence tempers decisiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impossibility blooming through persistence emerges via particulars like solvents' alphabet; final image ("pretend we planned it") resonantly reweights evolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sea fizzes like gossip," "world tolerates me enough to bloom") biases details; rhythmic control modulates irreverence under awe, stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("grease the bearings... aim my nose toward tomorrow"); figurative language purposeful and consistent in lyric voice, no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yearning algo, acid-sea glider quests, glyph-transliterating kaleidoscope feels inevitable; risk in inward path reweighting transforms tropes organically.</comment>
