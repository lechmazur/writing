<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preservation rules and hope act vividly in the decision to send despite "legitimate privacy," earned by incremental discoveries; interiority particular in "heart breaks in archived increments, but... toward repair." Final choice forecloses inaction with emotional cost on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries build density to Charged Poise closure in mailing the package; cost legible in "distrust gifts given late" and rule-bending. Orientation anchors immediately in file room post-emancipation; one tightening via button/note suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust patterns as recurring micro-setting constrain choices by signaling untouched files ("drifts like dunes"), charging final image of "dust made a map." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (reads scratches "the way I read shelves"); integrates seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify kindness vs. privacy rules) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through object discoveries narrowing to send/renounce choice; agency in "small investigation" and mailing forecloses inaction with rule-cost. Escalation via deepening knowledge of Alvarez/Rowan pressures stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of tenderness in unknowns emerges organically from particulars like button and "be warm" note, reweighted in final image of package release without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: "unknown can be tender when examined," inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic biases like "air itself is a ledger"; rhythmic control modulates from hushed discovery to propulsive mailing. Stable first-person POV with no leakage; compression taught early via dust-reading pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "red string, brittle with time, tied around a folder whose label frayed into a question mark"; varied rhythm, no loops despite lyric repetition. Figurative coherence in dust/button motifs without muddle in peak discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist as hope-detective in foster files transforms lost-object trope via dust-ledger ingenuity; risk-taking in sustained poetic voice heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Final mailing reconfigures premise inevitably from particulars.</comment>
