<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Neris's contradictory impulses—defunct revolutionary past versus custodial present—act in the tribunal choices, earning the final heart's revolt consideration with visible personal cost. Interiority is concrete and poetic, embodied in "touch its ache." Vark and judge apply targeted pressure without overwhelming clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard presentation to tableaux unspooling, tightening via second council scene that reconfigures dispute. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in judge's verdict and Neris's writing, with cost legible in "defunct heart considers revolt again" and Vark's grudge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and visible time constrain choices—storms force mirror-covering, seconds settle for shard activation—charging the final hush. Sensory details like "threads like bronze rain" and "walking seconds" filter through Neris's poetic bias, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine civilization) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Vark's counter and second tableau deepening knowledge/options. Agency in devising calibration forces trade-off, with cost in storm interruption and personal ache felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as craft versus decay emerges organically from shard scenes mirroring the dispute, reweighted in final image of "remorse could become architecture" without moralizing. Closing lines offer resonant answer: practiced breath devises future revolt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("eddy of chronology," "seconds walk like tame animals") modulates rhythm under storm pressure. Stable POV with poetic compression taught early, legible at closure; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic repetition ("burnished sorrow," mirror-covering) taught as pattern, propelling via varied rhythm. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors like "time strings itself like harp wires" slightly muddles one mid-beat but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, shard holograms, and revolutionary poetics transforms archaeological trope into ethical choreography. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, with shard's nursery origin reweighting decadence organically.</comment>
