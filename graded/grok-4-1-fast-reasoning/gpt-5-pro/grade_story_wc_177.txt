<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied lattice dissolution ("rain on copper, smoke in a schoolyard"), rooting motivation in fear of discard; final name-loosening renunciation earned via prior dream anchors. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more reflective than simultaneous in pivotal bunker beat, softening peak micro-choice hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure ("name loosen... way to move"), reweighting directive as mutual braid with work-cost legible in "lift, mend, listen, choose again." Orientation anchors instantly; dream interweave taught early pays off without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy ("ethereal grit," "moss and archived lightning") filters via POV urgency, constraining pace ("storm's edge moved with me"); stone figure and mud boots charge final image, mirroring transcendence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("discover why paths choose walkers") signaled early tightens texturally via directive revelation narrowing to invitation/work, forcing group-choice crystallization; cost felt in "bent toward mercy," but one-off deepening limits to very strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mutual election emerges organically from lattice particulars to resonant CR ("path... chose us as we chose it"), reweighting order-to-partnership without moralizing; ambiguity in "left bent toward mercy" invites lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vocals of owls... snail trails") biases noticing poetically; rhythmic modulation peaks in thunder-pupil sway, with stable first-person distance charging closure image—no elision or head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("vines shivered like a dream remembering"); figurative pattern taught early avoids muddle, but minor synonym churn on "path/dreams" in final third dulls one peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of decaying lattice-directive into braid-path invitation feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in scent-image plot transforms trope of quest into mutual election without gimmickry.</comment>
