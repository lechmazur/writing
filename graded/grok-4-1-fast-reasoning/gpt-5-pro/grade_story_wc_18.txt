<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iren's grounding in grief and work yields concrete micro-choices like aligning mirrors and offering the sextant index, earning the closure renunciation without trapping the dream. Contradictory impulses—capture by freedom—act in the synchronized breathing and testing scene. No stock phrasing; traits shown through counting apples amid rising mountains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fog/mirrors/breathing builds to Charged Poise closure where dream integrates via offering, reconfiguring orchard with felt cost in sextant sacrifice ("unscrewed the torn index...set it like a seed"). Orientation anchored early (Iren, orchard, fog). Single scene compression over nights legible; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fogged orchard constrains choices (rows as corridors, mud for anchoring) and charges final image (paths unroll, mirrors hold mountains). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: frost/sounds prioritized in breathing ritual. Evolves causally from thick to thinning curtains.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, tightens on third night via resistance/testing, agency in turning mirrors outward and offering index foreclosing trap-option with cost. Accumulative escalation via pattern break (bell sound, mirrors answer) reweights under lens; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of freedom-through-reflection emerges organically from breathing/mirrors erasing boundaries, final image ("mirrors held mountains of glass that sang") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting capture as belonging. No moralizing; ambiguity in dream's resistance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in boundary-erasing diction and rhythmic breathing cadence. Compression taught early (synchronized inhale/exhale), paid off in shared tempo with dream. Prose texture distinct: syntax mirrors fog-dissolving poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; purposeful repetition ("erasing boundaries") taught as motif without loops, rhythm varies (short clicks amid long drifts). Minor figurative density in peak ("river cupped in hands") coherent, no muddle touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirrors/sextant/dream in fog orchard transforms capture trope into belonging via textual geometry; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration ("sextant...now pointed to warmth") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
