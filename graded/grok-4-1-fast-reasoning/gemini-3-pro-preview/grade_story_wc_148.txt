<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to escape his father's curse is rooted in concrete traits like trembling fingers on the lattice and family derision; micro-choices like peering through gaps reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal conflict emerges in chasing hush amid ignored warnings, earning the escape renunciation of earthly bonds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as desperation density builds to on-page Decisive Change (dissolving escape), with conceptual cost in "rewritten its own ending" and ozone trace legible in final image. Orientation anchors Elian, lighthouse, post-storm by paragraph 2; single scene coherence perfect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse's "strange geometry" and fault-line physics constrain escape choice via lattice-flaw discovery; recurring copperlight charges final flare-swallow. Sensory selection (metallic stillness, ozone) reflects POV urgency, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape scapegoating) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening metaphysical desperation to hover/dissolve with foreclosed path (earthly tether). Agency in threading lattice to flaw narrows options; cost felt in guards' empty cell arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of cursed truth rewriting narrative emerges organically from ignored warning to labyrinth-threading escape; final silence reweights premise without moralizing. Dramatic irony (foreseen disaster) layers complexity, resonant in ozone lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fragmenting reality via lattice); rhythmic prose modulates from repose to flare eternity. Voice texture distinct in metaphysical diction like "neglected space," consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., shadow stretch to hum builds cadence); varied syntax passes ear test, purposeful lyric metaphors cohere without muddle. Minor overwrite in geometric flourishes doesn't dull closure flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-wolf curse with reality-fault physics yields ingenious exit via "scuffs on a narrow door"; risk-taking metaphysical dissolve heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from lattice seed.</comment>
