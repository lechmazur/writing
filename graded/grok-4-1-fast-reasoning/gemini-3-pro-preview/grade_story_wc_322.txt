<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in fevered traits compel higher-stakes weaving; contradictory rational vs. delirious impulses act in scene, earning the trapped realization as Earned Stasis. Final sacrifice feels particular, with micro-choices like pulling sinew revealing values. Minor slip in fluid memory of woman lacks concrete cue but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from weaving to fever spike, culminating in CR of pain as connection's texture with searing cost on page ("sinew thread snapped, whipping back against his skin"). Orientation anchored early in Penrose Atrium; one tightening traps him via his own patterns. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (heavy silence, humming air resonating in teeth, cold sweat) filter through fevered POV, constraining weaving choices; impossible triangle as micro-setting charges final rupture image. Gallery evolves causally, mirroring internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize illusions, discover texture) signaled early, escalates texturally via density increase to pattern break; agency in weaving forecloses escape with visible cost (trapped, seared skin). Climax bulge and snap narrow options undeniably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of real/unreal connection emerges organically from weaving particulars, reweighted in CR final image ("texture of connection was simply pain") without moralizing; resonant ambiguity lingers in sticky, hostile pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (fevered geometric obsession); rhythmic prose modulates from calm to fracture, prose as character in "rational enchantment" diction. No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught (visceral thread, violating geometry) without muddle in peak ("snapping bone" rupture). Minor density in opening metaphors doesn't obscure causality or closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fever architect stabilizing illusions transforms Escher tropes via biological sinew and rational enchantment; risk in textural build heightens stakes, inevitable CR feels bold and hindsight-earned.</comment>
