<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation intensely rooted in trauma drives micro-choices like weaving vines despite phantoms; final touch earned by prior struggle. Interiority particular via superimposed memories; embodied contradictions in euphoric dizziness amid regret. No safety-hedging, flaws compound isolation until geometric mastery confronts them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories and vines builds to pattern break at halo insertion, delivering CR closure where time's texture reconfigures premise with trauma's cost. Anchors clear by para 2 (Elian, bridge, trapped state). Single scene coherent, one tightening via distortion warping photos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains via supple vines twisted hyperbolically, charging final "braided bark" image; sensory hierarchy (twitching leaves vs. bleach-spotted rooms) filters through maze designer's bias. Atmosphere evolves causally from fog to ozone-thickened quaking. Micro-object (halo) tactilely lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (touch time to shatter memories) signaled early, escalates texturally via vibrations curling photo edges, narrowing to desperate shove with felt effort cost. Agency forecloses flat existence; deepening reweights to present's infinite expansion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of trauma as 2D vs. time's 3D weave emerges via disintegrating photos, final image non-literally repricing "rough, tactile architecture" with loss of past's hold. Resonance from hyperbolic knot's particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity in "beauty" lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with geometric perceptual signature (negative curves over regrets); rhythm compresses in climax cry, modulates intensity. Diction controlled, voice as desperate architect modulates without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short vibrational bursts amid lush weaves); no loops, metaphors cohere in hyperbolic payoff. Read-aloud rhythm peaks at "shivered like a waking god," breathing with quaking reverie.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of botany, sacred artifact, hyperbolic math transforms trauma tropes into inevitable texture revelation; bold risk in solo geometric ritual heightens stakes coherently. Premise feels singular, no derivative echoes.</comment>
