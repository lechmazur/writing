<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in traits drives patient decoding, shown in "ghost-like gentleness" over rough fibers. Interiority concrete via numbed fingers and philosophical lens, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a peak beat. Micro-choices reveal values with embodied cost, earning the harvest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to knot revelation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elias at Golden Wharf). Closure as CR in final image—"weight of the harvested truth"—reprices preservation with isolation cost, legible in "carried in the mind of one man."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: fulgurite reveals "energetic traces" amid cold-numbed touch and fog threat. Setting constrains via thickening fog obscuring work and rime-crusted hawser as resource. Final image charges with fog erasing "boundary between sea and sky," mirroring internal success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harvest seed signaled early, tightens accumulatively as fog deepens and pattern resolves in "triple-folded hitch." Agency in coaxing forecloses forceful alternative with felt cost in numbed patience. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fragile preservation emerges organically from knot-as-destiny script and weavers' intent. Subtext in "truth could not be forced; it had to be invited" layers ambiguity without moralizing. Final image reconfigures with resonant isolation, reweighting ancient methods' survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: world distorted through "lightning-glass" into hidden scripts. Voice texture maritime-philosophical, rhythm modulates from hush to wind sigh under fog pressure. No elision or head-hopping; diction biased to obsessions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate sense, action, revelation without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in "pattern resolved itself" climax. Figurative language purposeful (fog as "slow, grey tide"), coherent without muddle in peak decoding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scavenger trope into knot-diviner via fulgurite lens transforms maritime debris into destiny blueprint. Risk in abstract weavers realized through concrete patience, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes.</comment>
