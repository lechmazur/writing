<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's gentle weaving of truth through selective questions like "the shadow of his smile rather than the shape of his jaw" reveals contradictory impulses and compels the climactic blow; Elara's arc from trembling hope to hollow peace shows earned change with embodied cost in her scream and reaching hand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Oriented instantly in the gallery with Silas and Elara; accumulative/textural lens builds ritual density from grinding to powdering to drawing, culminating in CR closure when Silas blows the portrait as the rocker stops, reweighting preservation with her on-page scream-to-peace cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gallery's receding horizon mirrors memory's vanishing, constraining the ritual; rocker as micro-setting metronome charges climax by dictating the blow's timing, with dust swirling "like microscopic stars" into it as final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's stake for sanctuary tightens accumulatively through portrait formation, foreclosing holding-on via Silas's timed agency in the exhalation; cost legible in her gasp, scream, and "hollow peace" as options reconfigure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation's mirage emerges implicitly via ash ritual and dust dispersal, offering non-literal CR answer in Elara's realization—"the safety of holding on was the mirage"—reweighting grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable Silas-limited POV with perceptual bias toward ritual essence; distinct texture in rhythmic phrasing like "rhythmic crunch echoing," modulating to charged brevity at climax; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm—"creaks back and forth, a metronome"—propelling to climax; no loops or artifacts, though occasional elevated figuration like "somber marvel" borders overwriting but serves accumulative tone without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ritual premise of ash-scatter portrait in metaphysical gallery transforms grief trope into fresh, inevitable CR; risk of blowing the image heightens stakes organically, with porcelain mask and rocker synthesizing originality without gimmickry.</comment>
