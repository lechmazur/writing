<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's talent for acquiring abandoned hopes is concretely embodied in sensing survivor fractures and culminates in an earned release during the choral climax. Contradictory impulses—duty to seal versus connection—act simultaneously in the hesitation beat, compelling the crowning choice with personal cost. Minor abstract phrasing in epiphany ("dissolve the walls") slightly undercuts embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of shell confessions and pearl discovery builds to on-page Resonant Reconfiguration when crowning triggers light explosion, reweighting isolation with connection cost felt in Elias's weeping. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent. Closure cost legible in "his own soul...released," foreclosing sealed isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves, shells, and stalagmite constrain crowning choice and charge final image via refraction amplifying voices. Sensory details (breath misting, shell vibrations, pearl hum) filter through Elias's inspector bias, evolving with action. Micro-setting (stalagmite apex) guides decisive act without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify/seal vs. connect) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pearl's radiance deepening knowledge of hoarded dreams. Escalation peaks in hesitation beat forcing stance crystallization; crowning forecloses duty path with emotional cost in personal release. One meaningful pressure point suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of safety-as-imprisonment emerges organically from shell-confessions and pearl, reweighted non-literally in choral beacon image answering isolation premise. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing; final "openness of another’s spirit" carries conceptual cost without statement. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic pivot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sensing despair vibrations) biased to Elias's trade; diction/rhythm modulate from hush to explosive song effectively. Purposeful poetic compression taught early sustains texture without head-hopping. Minor register elevation in peak ("unadulterated connection") fits lyric aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; figurative language purposeful in accumulative build (e.g., "layer by agonizing layer"). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("dust motes," "heartbeat of a hesitation") dense but non-muddled; no loops obscure cause/effect. Slight scaffold in repetitive "darkness" echoes contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker inspector sensing hopes via shell-confessions transforms doomsday trope into emotional beacon premise. Pearl-crowning turn inevitable from established cave logic; risk in lyric hush-to-choir reconfiguration heightens stakes organically.</comment>
