<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between phobia and vow act simultaneously in scene ("Panic clawed...yet he forced his heavy boots forward"), earning the final endurance where phobia fuels survival; interiority embodied and particular without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (sensor confirms ghosts → slots gold fleck → keys override → Return completes); on-page Decisive Change at "The Return was finally complete" with legible cost in chronograph/tide turning and hull groan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (tidal currents snap umbilical, forcing scramble) and gold fleck charges final image as "singular point of reality"; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (phobia weaponizes silence, teeth vibrate from hum).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue before tide) signaled early, escalates via agency (override amid sensor scream/phase storm) narrowing options; cost unmistakable in pressure differential popping ears and "metallic shriek" forcing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of unremembered souls as data travelers emerges organically from Return (ghosts coalesce to cable pulse), resonant close reweights premise without moral ("they would be remembered...as travelers who found their way home").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (claustrophobia turns "dense silence" intimate torture); rhythmic control modulates intensity, diction biased (hush "in his bones," walls "inch closer").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line advances pressure/atmosphere); minor figurative density in climax ("ghostly storm," cable "black snake") purposeful without muddle, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medieval gold fleck calibrating photonic matter transmission transforms tropes; conceptual integrity commits to premise (ghosts as data packets), risk heightens stakes in phobia-calibrated climax.</question>
