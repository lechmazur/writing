<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Operator's motivation to mathematize emotion compels vivid personality shifts and the experiment's execution; Kael's embodied fear (head spin, trembling) reveals passivity under pressure. Internal conflict in Operator's rapid personas acts simultaneously during data influx.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ambiguity to psychic flood, culminating in on-page CR ("equation remains unsolved"; Kael hollowed, fragment dimmed, stars die) with legible conceptual cost of futile pursuit. Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Topaz walls vibrate and glow with feedback, constraining the psychic ritual and charging climax; pulsing halo shard as micro-setting enables contact and dimming. Sensory hierarchy (jaundiced light, humming) reflects Operator's lucid chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve emotion's math) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via disorienting phrases to transposed empathy flood narrowing Kael to agony; cost felt in "Kael screamed, but the sound was swallowed" and final hollowing foreclosing vitality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of futile emotional calculus emerges organically from stolen lives' chaos and cosmic erasure; final image ("Operator stood tall, vibrant... equation remains unsolved") resonantly reweights pursuit as vampiric endurance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalization with perceptual bias toward feverish chaos; voice texture (spiraling syntax) modulates with intensity, distinct in sparse dialogue (Operator's lullaby cruelty vs. Kael's tremble). No head-hopping; diction purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; metaphors like "silence of a loud noise" propel without muddle. Zero loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "tidal wave of sensation... thousand stolen lives."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress as psychic engine, halo shard, personality theft amid dying stars; risk-taking in lucid turbulence transforms mad-scientist trope into inevitable, cosmic void-chasing.</comment>
