<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation intensifies through embodied detachment and curiosity, culminating in an earned conceptual shift at the parasol discovery. Interiority feels particular, with loose grip on reality shown via trembling scenery perception. Minor abstract summaries slightly dilute peak contradiction in the final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via patient trawling building to CR closure: parasol tip reconfigures "sound" premise with legible cost (linear timeline resumption). Orientation anchors early in marina; one tightening via glinting object suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina vividly constrains trawling choices via jagged ice, slurry, thermal groans; sensory hierarchy (wind, scrape, glint) reflects Elias's auditory quest. Parasol as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (audible ending) signaled early, tightens texturally via failed groans to decisive cadence shift at "whisper of delicate things." Agency in persistent trawling forecloses deferral with felt cost (clinic journey). Minor abstraction in initial inertia slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of endings as textural shift emerges organically from trawling failures to parasol repricing, offering resonant non-literal answer in final wind-solace image. Subtext in fragile survivor avoids platitudes; complexity lingers in hollow curiosity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: reality as dissolving scenery biases noticing. Prose texture modulates rhythmically from methodical calm to crystallized poise; purposeful compression in reflective folds stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors touch closure. Rhythmic control peaks in "fold in patience smoothed out" line, integrating action and image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism with acoustic quest in disaster yields inevitable parasol epiphany; bold textural lens transforms death tropes via specific ice-bound salvage. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
