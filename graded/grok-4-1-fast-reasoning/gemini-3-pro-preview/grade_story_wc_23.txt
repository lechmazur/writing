<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to navigate loss is rooted in scars and embodied resonance ("sorrow of the flock passing through her own bones"), driving micro-choices like wedging the censer foot; endurance earns closure without tidy epiphany. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers from 9-band, but actions reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density swells from quiet phenomena to moon-peaked flood, tightening via phone coords and manual crank to Charged Poise closure ("ghosts were home... waiting for the moon to wane"); cost legible in "absorbed the excess heat... filter for the grief." Single scene, orientation anchored early, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze censer foot as micro-setting constrains choice (bridges circuitry, grounds energy) and charges final image ("hand still clutching the cooling bronze foot"); sensory hierarchy (frost breath, ozone/incense) reflects Elara's priorities, mirrors internal scars via "patchwork" motif without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (build corridor) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via moon zenith and "screaming" signals forcing manual stabilization; agency in crank twist forecloses failure path with embodied cost ("metal instantly grew hot... vibrating with the energy"). One decisive deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of human navigation amid mechanical ruin emerges organically from particulars (reverse ghosts, scarred maps/skin); final image reconfigures as resonant answer ("found a human function... peace in the dark") without moralizing, embracing loss's complexity via absorption cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("patchwork navigator... geography of loss"); rhythmic control modulates from heavy silence to "jarring, mechanical scream," purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens. No dialogue to judge, diction biased to Elara's topography lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("wedged the bronze claw... circuit completed"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds, figurative language purposeful (e.g., "lighthouse beam out of static") without muddle in peak. Minor elevated diction fits voice, no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral reverse migration, censer-conducted signal station, and loss-navigation transforms tropes; risk in lyric density heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Elara's scarred endurance charging "peace in the dark."</comment>
