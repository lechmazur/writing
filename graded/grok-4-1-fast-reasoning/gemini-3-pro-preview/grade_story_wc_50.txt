<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in traits drives micro-choices like peripheral focus and timer adjustment, with embodied stress in trembling hands; meaningful endurance shown in balancing intuition/calculus. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in the capture beat for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from process density to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Decisive capture ("metallic thud") reconfigures cavern with legible cost in "stripped of its ambient spirit and reduced to mere geology."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Marble cavern's geometry constrains reflection mapping and echo trajectories, charging final warp-then-dead image. Sensory details (mist, whirring, light shaft) selective via POV urgency; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (echo harvest) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through synchronization to agency-driven capture narrowing options. Cost unmistakable in cavern's death post-thud, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder amid chaos emerges organically from process to resonant final image of "custodian... into the snow." Non-literal reconfiguration reweights storage's conceptual cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (peripheral distortions, reflective bias); rhythmic modulation heightens capture whir. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors coherent ("vacuum for nostalgia") and pattern-taught without muddle in peak. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; varied rhythm supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes locksmith/memory-harvest ingeniously, transforming tropes via echo physics and timer inversion; risk in lyric process heightens closure stakes inevitably.</comment>
