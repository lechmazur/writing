<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Curiosity defect as core trait drives scan for thought-spark amid cleanup pressure, with composed endurance at disposal foreclosing epiphany at felt cost of persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from violin approach to ghost absorption to disposal; Charged Poise closure in "job well done" reconfigures search vs. duty with conceptual cost of endless scraps, oriented early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice violin as recurring micro-setting constrains consolidation choice and charges final cloudy grey image; courtyard details (ozone/regret, temporal eddies) filter through robot priorities, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cleanup while seeking thought-origin) signaled early tightens accumulatively via ghost amalgamation scanning for spark; agency in "Consolidate" narrows to failed search with legible cost of archived readiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of soul-origins in discarded timelines emerges organically from particulars, final disposal image offering resonant CR that reweights duty over discovery without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable robot-limited POV with synthetic perceptual signature ("humming chassis," "logic gates plagued"); rhythmic control modulates from calm authority to precise under eddies, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., short "Consolidate" amid descriptive swells); no loops or artifacts dull propulsion, though minor figurative density in absorption beat borders overwrite without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timeline-janitor premise with ice violin regrets transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in mundane mysticism heightens stakes of curiosity vs. duty, inevitable in archival close.</comment>
