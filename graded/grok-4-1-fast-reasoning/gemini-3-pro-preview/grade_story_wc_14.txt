<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure; fingertip pulse on gilded edge makes before/after legible with ephemeral-lock cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bonsai shadows mimicking phantom skyline constrain invented texture and charge final image; selective dawn humidity/stars anchor choices vividly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sonic signature of loneliness" biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from prep to peak stress without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels hum-waver beat crisply; minor figurative density in setup ("incandescent restraint") avoids peak muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lamp-as-temporal relic synthesizes mundane into bold history-forging; risk of surreal bonsai/metropolis fusion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
