<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's truth compulsion creates contradictory impulses in critiquing Kael's desperation while delaying via riddle, earning the stasis of revelation; Kael applies relational pressure. Final reveal choice forecloses restart path with guilt pang, scaled cost visible. Voices distinct in poetic truth vs. frantic shouts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oriented early in glass booth post-drone failure; situational lens holds as Kael's pressure crystallizes Silas's stance. Riddle tightens to reveal ash, landing Charged Poise CR where Kael whispers "Yes" to beauty, conceptual cost of permanent failure undeniable in final gaze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dusk light through tower ribs filters perception and charges final image, constraining reveal timing; ozone/sour milk smell embodies stakes. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, mirroring wonder motive without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder vs. power) signaled early, tightens via riddle compulsion narrowing options to reveal; agency in truth forces Kael's defeat. Cost legible in ash/dead bee and "defeated by the scenery."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inefficiency's beauty emerges organically from truthful barbs and reveal; final horizon image offers non-literal answer reweighting hive premise. Subtext in silence post-"Yes" invites ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in amber light/wonder observations; dialogue goal-driven (persuade patience vs. demand access) with subtext. Rhythm modulates from serene opener to frantic peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels; no loops/artifacts. Minor opener metaphor density ("bruised apricot") purposeful but slightly overwrites setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth curse, drone hive, toll riddle transforms efficiency trope; nectar dusk inflections inevitable in hindsight, risking poetic stasis payoff.</comment>
