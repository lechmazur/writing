<question>1</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Silas's shadowed elation and contradictory impulses—manic glee amid storm chaos—embody specific flaws driving micro-choices like prophetic adjustments; collapse after beam eruption earns stasis with heaving chest cost. Final whispered affection to the wick seals character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from routine slotting to light saturation and shadow projection; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands in "green shadow of the lighthouse that truly broke the dawn," reweighting light-chaos control with dam prophecy cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Glass wick and iron wheel constrain choices like beam steering; vivid sensory hierarchy (emerald glow hum, storm rage) filters through Silas's manic priorities, charging final shadow image over skyline.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake to guide storm tightens via light's critical saturation forcing wheel turn; agency in hard left steer forecloses paths with collapse cost and implied dam tragedy, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Light/shadow duality emerges organically from wick mechanics to skyline projection, offering resonant non-literal answer in final obelisk shadow; prophecy slips add ironic complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of ecstatic tech-ritual noticing ("skin prickle with electric delight"); rhythmic diction modulates from jerky grace to shrieking peak, consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density propels via varied syntax and embodied rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak metaphors ("contained supernova," "sword of green fire") slightly muddles without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via TIR wick steering ether-storms for shadow dawn-shaping; non-obvious synthesis of quantum prophecy and bio-luminescent control feels inevitable in final reconfiguration.</comment>
