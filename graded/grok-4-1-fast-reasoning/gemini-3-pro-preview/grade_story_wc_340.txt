<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to seek joy beneath anguish drives all micro-choices, like using the goggles precisely before time runs out, earning the serene validation. Interiority is embodied and particular, with affectionate detachment shown in "loving the old Captain enough to invade his privacy." Contradictory impulses act in the privacy invasion under composure, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: ascent density builds revelation via prisms and light, landing CR closure in "He had found the warmth in the cold" with conceptual cost of reweighted memory. Orientation anchored immediately in elevator/spire. No slips; pivotal revelation beat flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Icebound spire and elevator constrain tactics via rime ice, shifting pressure, and sun shafts enabling prism revelation, charging final solarium image. Sensory hierarchy (gears groaning, light refracting) reflects Elian's priorities. 9+ gate met multiple ways; micro-setting (goggles/diary) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover joy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as floors pass and light scatters to reveal text, narrowing to discovery with privacy cost legible. Agency in precise unfolding/pressing; one deepening sufficient. Minor abstractness in initial stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of layered memory/joy beneath anguish emerges organically via revelation, final image resonating non-literally as "final gift" reweights Halloway's grief. Subtext in hidden silver pigment; invites ambiguity without confusion. 9+ test: reweights premise cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature: warmly inquisitive gaze filters setting (e.g., "tilting his head as the elevator passed the second floor"). Rhythmic control modulates ascent intensity; no elision issues. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel via floor-click rhythm mirroring discovery; "prisms in the lenses broke the sunbeams into specific spectral bands" multifunctional. No loops/artifacts; minor elevated diction fits voice without muddle. Opening/final lines recharge motifs perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Goggles-prism diary reveal in spire elevator synthesizes steampunk discovery freshly, transforming grief trope via spectral joy. Risky single-scene compression heightens ingenuity; turns inevitable from setup. 9+ test: non-obvious inevitability.</comment>
