<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional single-POV interiority with embodied emotion (shivering from title's weight) and contradictory impulses acting in mirrors scene; final repair choice earned by prior resolve against futility visions, with visible cost in gritted effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early (atmospheric build to machinery grind) holds to on-page DC closure (wheel turns, moon slides) with felt cost of torque resistance; orientation anchored in first paragraph, one tightening via mirrors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (vibration guides blind navigation through mirrors) and charges final veranda image; sensory hierarchy (briny wind, ozone solvent) reflects locksmith priorities, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release stalled moon) signaled early tightens accumulatively via mirrors' psychological pressure then gears' resistance; agency in solvent/cog choice forecloses failure path with on-page cost (heavens' groan, gritted teeth).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rhythmic repair emerges organically from mirrors' failures to restored cadence, final image reweights futility motif without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in world's awakening under earned peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (cosmic leviathan ribcage, syncopated heartbeat); rhythmic modulation heightens repair pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but dense figurative layering in opening risks minor coherence slip (e.g., leviathan/ship hinges blend); climax action clean, no loops or scaffolds touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith fixing celestial gears transforms library trope via soul-refracting ice and stardust-seized astrolabe; risk-taking in poetic fantasy premise inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
