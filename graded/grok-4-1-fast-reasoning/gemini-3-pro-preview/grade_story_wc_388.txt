<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to debunk shines in patient letter reassembly and gut-driven fix, revealing contradiction between logic and intuition; "leap of faith for a man of logic" earns the final renunciation of myth protection with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through entry → discovery → fix → realization; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands in final paragraph where pocketing letter forecloses sanctuary's safety with undeniable conceptual cost of truth over myth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wasteland orchard and lab constrain choices vividly; hovering diamond and failing coils charge climax and final image, with sensory details like "whining pitch of the magnetic coils" narrowing perception under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth amid failing shield tightens via destabilizing hum into intuitive agency; cost legible in orchard preservation versus myth's destruction, though climax relies slightly on solo deduction over opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of harsh truth over comforting lies emerges via diamond's mundane reality; final image of "flawed diamond, the perfect machine" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual bias (observant debunker noticing confetti, vibrations); rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively, perceptual signature in "vibration of the floorboards" under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action; minor figurative density in opening ("screaming with the fury") risks slight overwrites but supports atmosphere without obscuring closure rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of debunker preserving myth indirectly via science "curse"; "Widow’s Tear" as hyper-dense lens transforms post-apoc tropes organically through causal ingenuity.</comment>
