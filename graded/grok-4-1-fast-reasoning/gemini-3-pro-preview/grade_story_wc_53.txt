<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via eroded ambitions clashing with resolute scavenging, culminating in earned renunciation of rule-the-sky desire after ghost's touch; interiority embodied in "ache of being chronologically confused" and regret flooding chest. Final choice to spin wheel backward reveals hierarchy of values with futile cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws drive sabotage revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scavenging density builds to CR closure at revelation ("He saw himself... jamming a wrench"), reweighting premise with regret cost on knees in fluid. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via barter suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lagoon constrains choices (wading viscosity, invisible platforms) and charges final image (ripples mirroring turmoil); recurring wheel handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (static frequencies over visuals); details integrated into goal-directed action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate memory) signaled early, tightens via barter voices narrowing to revelation; agency in ratchet-winding and presenting echoes forecloses ignorance with embodied cost (knees buckle). Escalation accumulative under lens, but abstract "center of stillness" slightly mutes visceral price mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sabotage-for-perfection emerges organically via particulars (wheel, ghost barter); final image of futile backward spin offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting eroded ambitions with conceptual cost of self-made purgatory. No moralizing; ambiguity in "would speak it himself tomorrow" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (ozone mist, snagged frequencies); voice modulates rhythm under stress (short "Click-click-whine"). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("I brought the voices"); no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (sentences multi-job via image/action); rhythm varies (read-aloud ear test passes). Minor mixed metaphors ("charged mercury," "frozen wave-form") in opener cohere under surreal tone but slightly overload without pattern payoff; no loops or scaffolds touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of stalled sky, story-scavenging via camera wheel, self-ghost negotiation feels inevitable and fresh; transforms tropes (time-freeze, regret) through specific sabotage reveal. Risky fractured stillness heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
