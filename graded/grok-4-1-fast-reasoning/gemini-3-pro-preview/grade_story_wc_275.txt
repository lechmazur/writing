<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in knife-glinting hesitation versus sheathing, earning pacifist endurance with vulnerability cost as phantom inheritance ripples blood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure: turning back on intruder reconfigures intrusion stake, cost legible in deliberate risk through glass.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass dome constrains separation/work while enabling final influence, charging closure image of stranger's drained tension; ballast sand and roses tactilely lived-in.</comment>
