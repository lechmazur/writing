<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory caution versus desperate verification peaks in respirator removal, earning grief-struck realization with embodied tears as cost; interiority particular via aromatic terror and childhood scent-haunt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds sensory density to CR closure in "memory verified, but never truly recovered," with cost legible in final ache and resealed vial; single scene anchors early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>UV emitter and respirator constrain verification choice; crystal shadows and blue pollen cloud charge final shroud image, filtering through professional bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scent-memory hypothesis) tightens via mask removal and inhalation, forcing trade-off with grief cost; textural deepening narrows to irrecoverable verification under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Scent as "physical substance... coating the lungs" reweights memories via UV reveal and grief, resonant in final shroud without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "aromatically cautious" bias and lyrical diction ("petals unspooled like wet silk"); rhythm modulates to peak stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; minor figurative density ("crystal shadows cut through... timeline") integrates without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of UV scent-reveal and extinct flora transforms memory trope; lantern-broker frame and "chemical ghost" yield inevitable, risky CR without hedging.</comment>
