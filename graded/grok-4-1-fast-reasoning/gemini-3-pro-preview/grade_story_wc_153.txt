<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Julian's motivation roots deeply in embodied shame and regret, culminating in an earned shift at closure where he carries the stone "lighter than before." Elara applies precise pressure via cryptic observations that force micro-choices. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "heart hammering" slightly undercuts peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to moonlight fusion and message reveal, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure with legible emotional cost in the stone's re-breaking and Julian's resolve. Orientation anchors crisply in first paragraph. No causality breaks; pattern of supernatural restoration pays off precisely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mangrove setting and shelves of unsent letters constrain the ritual and charge the final image of the weeping message. Sensory details like "singing spirits" and "humid air" filter through Julian's urgency, mirroring internal fracture. Gargoyle shard as micro-setting evolves to reweight closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to discern past silence—tightens via message revelation under accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization with emotional cost in tears and lighter stone. One decisive deepening suffices; agency in seeking ritual forecloses denial. Minor abstractness in initial stake declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges via shard fusion and window message, reweighting pride's debris in final image without moralizing. Fierce tenderness subtext charges closure resonant with shelves of letters. Particulars drive ambiguity that lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward regret; voice modulates poetically yet consistently. Dialogue carries subtext—"You bring a fracture"—pursuing revelation. Rhythm heightens in ritual beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "choir of weeping violins" taught early; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in descriptive peaks slightly blurs a few sentences, but closure image remains sharp. Syntactic variety supports mystical cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gargoyle shard as regret conduit and condensation séance transforms medium trope organically. Risky mystical logic commits fully, heightening stakes in temporary healing. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from swamp's ether.</comment>
