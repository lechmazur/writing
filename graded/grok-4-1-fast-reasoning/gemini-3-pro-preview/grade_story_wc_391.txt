<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's precise interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like counting degrees while resisting Kael's impatience, earn her patient revolution stance; Kael's transformation via relationship crucible adds depth. Minor telling in "Her motivation was complex" slightly dilutes embodiment but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: frozen lake, rain-slick viaduct, and moon alignment because/therefore lead to lever throw and DC collapse with legible cost in severed supply line. Closure image of slumping viaduct reconfigures options precisely on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Basalt ramparts, frozen lake reflecting resonance, and wet viaduct constrain timing/choice, charging final groan and sparks; sensory details (hum, wind howl) filter through Elara's mapper bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patient sabotage) tightens via moon zenith, forcing Elara's precise agency; Kael's pressure and mistiming risk foreclose explosive alternative with cost in viaduct's self-destruction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Patient revolution emerges organically from Elara's wait vs. Kael's urge, resonating in his "terrified reverence" and final image of unstoppable frost; reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Elara's perceptual signature (horizon charting, arc degrees); dialogue distinct—Kael's hiss/kick vs. her command—advances goal/subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor figurative density ("coiled spring," "trapped spirits") in buildup risks slight overwrites without muddling climax groan.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar physics, magnetic sabotage, and glacial revolution transforms tropes; viaduct's internal dissonance feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
