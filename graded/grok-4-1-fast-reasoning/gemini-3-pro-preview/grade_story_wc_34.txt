<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in loss drives micro-choices like fluid spraying; embodied senses and relic-handling reveal traits under pressure. Closure smile earns from prior causality. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses in climax for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through preparation-to-lightning chain; on-page DC as lights smooth and tension vanishes, with legible cost in shockwave soak. No orientation debt; constraint of timing shapes tactics perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty high-altitude courtyard and ozone constrain graffiti timing and charge paint; sensory hierarchy sharpens to hum/hiss under urgency. Weather mirrors internal fog, charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to free ghost signaled early; causal tightening via bruising sky and desperate speed forces agency in split-second press, with physical soak as cost. Escalation coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of analog-digital bridge emerges organically from encoded ballad and relic; final pocketed plate reweights loss without moralizing. Resonant CR in washed calm avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with musician-biased perceptual signature (hummed frequencies, tinkersong); rhythmic prose modulates from whimsical to precise under stress. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and strong verbs; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative stack in "suspended silent gasp" fits voice without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-hex upload via lightning relic transforms cyberpunk; non-obvious payoff feels inevitable from tinkersong setup. Bold risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
