<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symphonically minded trait shown concretely via cello suites mirroring carbon bonds and river as score, enabling insight; internal conflict between unbreakable plastics and natural temporality embodied in grief softening on precipice. Final change earned as prior observations foreclose linear polymer path with cost of past refuse guilt. Minor label-speak like "deep, burning motivation" slightly abstracts without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure via foam insight reconfiguring polymer approach. Orientation anchored early (precipice, ravine). Crushing chrysalis delivers legible conceptual cost of vanishing legacy, felt in wind carrying dust down ravine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>River foam patterns and braided channels constrain insight choice, charging final image; sensory details (wet limestone, pine, silver threads) filtered through chemist's symphonic bias. Environment evolves causally from observation to epiphany site.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atoning polymer) signaled early, deepens via river observation tightening to insight that forecloses durable-only path. Agency in sustained attention yields trade-off cost in legacy shift. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens with single decisive density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of synthetic-biological harmony emerges organically via chrysalis/river particulars; final dust image reconfigures separation-to-connection without statement. Resonant non-literal answer reweights prior grief and patents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in chemical-musical diction (e.g., "vibration of carbon bonds," "molecular eddy"); rhythm modulates to euphoric rush crescendo. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., foam rush to eddy mirrors chain unraveling); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts in peak insight beat. Minor overwrought simile ("liquid tapestry") but coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science, chrysalis fragility, and river hydrodynamics into self-unmaking material; risk-taking in symphonic metaphors heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from ravine particulars.</comment>
