<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in the erratic dance resist nostalgia while pursuing truth; final resolve after revelation earned by prior struggle, with innocence lost as visible cost in "snapping inside her chest."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dance density builds to rotunda; CR closure via neural projection reconfigures worldview with emotional cost legible in simultaneous laughter/sobs and "burden of truth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Psychoactive dust and morphing terrain constrain dance choices; saffron veil and pagoda charge final image, with sensory details (glittering atoms, windless air) filtered through Elara's urgent perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reach truth tightens via erratic choreography under Accumulative lens; agency in pattern avoidance forecloses entrapment, cost felt in "end of innocence snapping" and resolved burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anguished joy emerges organically from revelation of lost golden age; final image of dancing back "cold, sharp, and resolved" reweights premise without moralizing, embracing irretrievable beauty's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (nostalgia atoms as threat); rhythmic prose modulates from chaotic dance to crystalline resolve, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion; figurative language purposeful in high-pressure dance ("jagged, nonsensical choreography") without muddling closure, minor metaphor density in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-archive world and anti-pattern dance transforms quest trope; pagoda revelation and "atoms of nostalgia" feel inevitable, bold lyric risk heightens emotional stakes.</comment>
