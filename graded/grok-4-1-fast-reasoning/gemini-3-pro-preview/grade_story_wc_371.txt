<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied guilt and contradictory impulses during bread ritual, where slicing and tasting compel a micro-renunciation of despair with visible emotional cost. Chronicler traits drive micro-choices like gentle planting, revealing hierarchy of values without safety-hedging. Final endurance of sacred act earns closure change via prior noticing compulsion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from street noticing to planting to bread communion, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing where guilt lifts "slightly" amid "fragile" steam—tenuous cost legible in "wouldn't last beyond the meal." One tightening via ritual acts narrows to charged stasis. Orientation anchors early (Elias, post-migration city, palace); no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard and cloaked tea house constrain access (rusted gap, thorns, drones), guiding choices like gentle seed-tucking. Recurrent bare earth and vines mirror internal erosion, charging final wind-rattled branches image. Sensory hierarchy (wet leaves, crust crack, caraway taste) filters via noticer's bias, evolved causally with entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve sacred vibrancy vs. societal fade) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through guerrilla acts to deepening bread ritual where agency crystallizes endurance. One tightening forecloses forgetting via tasted memory, with felt price in fragile absolution. Moral calculus between rebellion and guilt sharpens peak bite moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred endurance amid creeping gray emerges organically from particulars like vanished elms and rye loaf, reweighted in final image without moralizing. Subtext in ritual silence implies complex ambiguity: absolution "enough" yet doomed. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of noticing's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with noticer perceptual signature (absences like elm shade, bakery ovens) biases details character-specifically. Prose rhythm modulates from deliberate planting to hushed bite, with diction like "creeping normality noticer" anchoring voice. No head-hopping; compression in ritual serves emotional poise.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection without loops; syntax varies for propulsion, peaking in "crust cracking... too loud" sensory punch. Minor overwrite in "chaotic tapestry" metaphors (−0.4), but no scaffold or muddle touches closure rye steam image. Paragraph cuts test passed; vivid verbs propel to end.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quiet dystopian resistance via bread ritual transforms guerrilla trope through noticer's lens and tenuous rite. Risky lyric poise in single-scene accumulation heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established fade particulars.</comment>
