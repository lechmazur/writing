<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to deconstruct historical lies drives micro-choices like feeling cable tension and releasing evidence, with embodied nausea as felt cost in the closure. Interiority particular via "nerve ending" instincts and "serene upheaval." Final renunciation earned by prior dives and confirmation, revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from winch hum to sundial shadow, culminating in CR where noon confirmation inverts history, cost legible in "lowering the evidence back." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity; persistent dawn constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sundial and canal constrain choices (verifies geometry, dawn deadline), charging final ray alignment. Sensory vivid/POV-biased: "wet iron" mist, "oily water." Details evolve causally (sludge drips, water smooth), mirroring internal inversion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover lie before dawn) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via plate bend and sundial shadow, narrowing to renunciation with emotional cost ("nausea"). Agency in salvage/release forecloses exposure path; radio silence forces crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lies' architecture emerges via particulars: rum facade to murder foundation, sundial reprise reweights premise in final shadow without moralizing. Resonant CR in "legends better left as ghosts," oblique conceptual cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: historical lens filters ("architecture of lies," "lens that sharpens"). Rhythmic texture modulates (hushed to "scream"), compression purposeful in peak confirmation; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "cable hummed, tight as a violin string" advances action/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; precise verbs ("groaned," "cascaded"); propulsion peaks in sundial alignment without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sundial proving noon sinking transforms salvage trope into lie-deconstruction, with fresh release renunciation. Risky quiet CR heightens stakes via "one man understood the lie"; synthesis inevitable from barge constraints.</comment>
