<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's motivation rooted in swallowed truth from accident intensifies through appraisal of valve, earning realization with felt cost of shared guilt. Interiority concrete and embodied in "drowsy alertness" shifting to trance. Contradictory skepticism vs. seeking residual trauma validation acts in scene without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and radio static build to Conceptual Repricing closure at valve grip/release, reweighting negligence as frozen mistake with conceptual cost of eased burden. Orientation anchored early in tunnel exploration. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Valve wheel as recurring micro-setting constrains appraisal choice and charges final release image. Sensory details (gravel crunch, condensation "like sweat") selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent through widening tunnel to mill junction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negligence's weight) signaled early, tightens texturally via radio confession syncing with valve position, narrowing to stance crystallization. Cost legible in "burden...slightly easier" after realization. Agency in persistent exploration endures to closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trauma's physics emerges organically from radio calls, valve seal, and ghost shift as "memory of labor," resonating in final image without moralizing. Subtext in skeptical lens reweights malice vs. negligence via concrete particulars. Invites ambiguity on unanswered prayers' energy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: skeptical filtering of radio hysteria as "raw data stream." Prose texture rhythmic and biased toward industrial decay, modulating from drowsy to trance without distance slips. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm, integrating action like "boots crunching on gravel" without scaffolds. No loops, though "weight" motif purposeful; minor cliché in "glistening jewels" but contained. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: radio psychics as navigation tool transforms ghost trope into physics of mistake, inevitable in valve confession sync. Risk in textural drive heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to skeptical explorer's arc.</comment>
