<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's calculated mask and Vance's trembling hand reveal contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning Vance's whispered admission of doubt as a visible cost. Professional detachment and soul-reading traits drive micro-choices like the chime gesture. Minor label-speak in "sincerely insincere" slightly dilutes embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via chime choice → mirror reveal → cloak drape, delivering Charged Poise closure as Vance wraps the fabric tighter, reconfiguring his certainty with felt emotional cost in the final image. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse gallery at dawn. No ambiguity or breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wind chimes and rusted railing constrain choices, charging the final dawn light bleeding through glass. Sensory details like biting cold and rattling iron integrate via action, mirroring internal shifts. Atmosphere evolves from conviction to vulnerability without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cracking Vance's certainty escalates causally through mirror's boy-image tightening, forcing agency in cloak acceptance with legible cost of shattered facade. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending. No abstract stakes or resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of doubt as protective nuance emerges organically from cloak/mirror tools, with final image of Vance weighing moral cost offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting certainty's premise. Subtext in chimes and whispers avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Elias POV with perceptual signature in soul-led noticing (e.g., "resonant frequency of a client's fractured soul"). Dialogue subtextual and idiomatic; rhythm modulates from purred persuasion to soft instruction. No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied syntax, but overwrought metaphors like "suspended chaotic orchestra" cluster early, slightly muddling peak mirror beat without obscuring closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; read-aloud rhythm strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conscience-for-hire via chimes/mirror/cloak transforms moral certainty trope, with risk-taking poetic conceit heightening stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
