<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's ethical diligence and flawed imperfections drive micro-choices like using the inscribed rake in the pause, earning incremental absolution with embodied cost (trembling fingers, worn wood). Interiority is concrete and particular, rooted in communal guilt and personal sins. Contradictory impulses surface in reverie amid mechanical precision, though not peak-simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stuttered escapement to pause-moment adjustment, landing Charged Poise RR/CR as pendulum descends carrying rake's memory, with legible cost in eroded inscriptions. Single scene anchors who/where/when early (Silas in tower overlooking ridge). No orientation debt; lens unambiguous at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and clock chamber constrain choice via physics of swing/pause; bob as micro-setting charges final descent image. Sensory hierarchy (brine reflection, brass friction, whine song) filters through Silas's reverie, mirroring fractured soul without overt symbolism. Evolving details (hot air to cold reality) integrate via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore sync amid guilt) signaled early; tightening in pause narrows options under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance/agency with trade-off cost (burned wood, burden erosion). Pressure coheres via communal discord dragging gears; final image crystallizes reconfigured balance with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges organically from rake sins feeding mechanism, reweighting premise in final alignment of clock/heart without moralizing. Closing image (worn handle, healed timeline) offers resonant non-literal answer to guilt's meter. Complexity lingers in persistent flaws, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (searing reverie degrading to cold tock); rhythmic modulation heightens pause tension. Prose texture distinct in syntax (long arcs to split-second), diction biased to temporal purity. No elision or head-hopping; compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density in climax beat ("song... whine... Braille... iron heart") risks minor muddle without full pattern payoff (-0.3). Zero loops; strong verbs anchor propulsion. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: sins inscribed on rake vibrate into clock for absolution transforms trope of guilt/redemption via specific mechanics. Risky lyric compression (reverie amid swing physics) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
