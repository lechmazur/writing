<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's shift from curiosity to embracing deception feels earned through embodied vertigo and micro-choice to take the seal; Elara's spider-thin dexterity and riddle-speaking reveal character under pressure without stereotypes. Final endurance forecloses truth with felt palm-weight cost. Minor slip in stock "wave of vertigo" phrasing slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seal discovery → interrogation → revelation narrows options to lie or collapse, closing with Charged Poise as Silas takes seal ("weight of the deception settle into his palm") reconfiguring stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Single scene, anchored by ~100 words (rooftop, jasmine, meteors). No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Meteor shower and rooftop parapet constrain vertigo realization and frame truth-as-danger image, charging closure; jasmine-ozone sensory hierarchy reflects urgency. Ivy-wrought iron subtly mirrors decaying "belief." Body/setting integration tightens stakes without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (building endurance via lie) signaled early, tightens via Elara's reveal forcing trade-off (truth = fall); Silas's agency in slamming seal and accepting pours agency into closure. Cost legible in foreclosed truth path, but minor abstractness in "groans" declaration tempers peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "agreed upon lies" emerges organically via seal symbols and Elara's "we agree... walls are sound," reweighted in final "conjugate the verb to endure" without statement. Subtext in her patient pour amid accusation charges ambiguity. Resonant non-literal answer in tea request.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV to Silas with perceptual bias (buildings whisper); dialogue distinct—Elara's riddles vs. Silas's snaps carry subtext, advancing revelation. Rhythm modulates in stroboscopic light beats. Minor filter-verb stack in opening sensory ("framing... overgrown ivy") dulled entry slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "scratches on a developed negative" advances atmosphere/plot); rhythm varies, propulsion peaks in seal slam. Minor mixed metaphor in "violent friction of entry" vs. scratches and synonym lean in "perceptive student" echo slightly drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic deception holding architecture transforms tropes (cursed building) via "lie to the stone" premise; risk in conceptual CR (truth > meteors) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from sugar pretext to seal endurance.</comment>
