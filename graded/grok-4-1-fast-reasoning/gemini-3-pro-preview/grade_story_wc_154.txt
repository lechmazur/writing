<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation intensifies through trauma-linked micro-choices like fingering the coral and rewriting the cast, earning the final reconfiguration; contradictory impulses emerge in trembling hand amid analytical precision. Interiority embodied in chest tightness and tactile tracing avoids stock phrasing. Minor diagnostic slips like "palimpsest" do not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cast examination to decryption to rewrite, landing Charged Poise RR at "He had successfully unknotted the narrative," reconfiguring trauma with felt emotional cost in synced breathing and softened scribbles. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist evolves from "saline mist" barrier to closing "blanket," charging final image and mirroring internal shift; teak bench, plaster, coral constrain tactile choices. Sensory hierarchy (hum, rough texture, dimming light) reflects translator's precision under ache. No white-room; micro-setting integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cleanse boy's memory of war) signaled early, tightens via decryption of mother's warning forcing rewrite agency; Accumulative deepening reweights options with emotional cost in "lotus-hearted ache." One pressure point suffices; cost legible in grafted meaning versus original terror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grafting healing onto trauma emerges organically from rewrite turning "hide" to "hold," resonant non-literal answer in final mist-blanket image recharging cast as palimpsest. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in symbolic cleansing's limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in codebreaker gaze and dialect recognition; rhythmic modulation accelerates in decryption beat. Voice distinct, syntax mirrors analytical tenderness without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like coral mirroring "tangled neural pathways"; varied rhythm propels to closure. Minor overwriting in clustered metaphors ("palimpsest," "lotus-hearted") near peak slightly muddles but pattern-taught; no loops or scaffolds dull ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: translator decrypts/rewrites war cast as trauma therapy, transforming trope via coral-cast parallel; risk in symbolic revision heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early setup.</comment>
