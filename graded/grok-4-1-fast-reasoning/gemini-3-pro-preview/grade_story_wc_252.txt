<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vane's contradictory fury in the wrestle—pushing yet embraced—acts simultaneously with Elian's compassionate hold, earning the release; motivation roots in fluid nature vs. rigidity, compelling higher stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as rising water density links search to scrimshaw warming to whale vibration; Vane's bollard release as DC reconfigures with dock dissolution cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe with sea grapes twining waists constrains detachment choice; final "chaotic blue" and silt cloud charge transformation image, sensory hierarchy narrowing to vibration in marrow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rising tide deepens stake of rigid refusal vs. fluid embrace under accumulative lens, forcing Vane's agency in release; cost legible in foreclosed island and drifting scrimshaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fluid freedom emerges from combative tenderness wrestle to gill-flare; final "kicking their legs with newfound power" resonantly reweights boundaries without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third via Elian's perceptual fluidity—"unnatural fluidity of a dancer"—with rhythmic modulation; dialogue subtextual as Vane chokes "I will not drown," advancing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in "baritone earthquake" vibration propels climax without loops or muddle; syntax varies from long atmospheric opens to short "Let go" urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pacified violence yielding "combative tenderness" to whale-summoned gills synthesizes eco-fantasy boldly; risk of fluid physics heightens stakes inevitably toward oceanic home.</comment>
