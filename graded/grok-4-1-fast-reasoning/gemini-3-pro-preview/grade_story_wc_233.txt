<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Isolde's disenchantment and dream-pull create contradictory impulses (ignores numbness and warnings for beauty in terror), earning her guardianship shift with embodied cost at "searing away her disenchantment."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds to CR closure where fireflies reprice starlight from end to stewardship, with legible endurance cost in final grotto image; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember grotto and bleeding starlight constrain choices (dance through daggers) and charge final image, with sensory details like "sizzled and dissolved into lace-like patterns" woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach grotto amid deluge) accumulates density via near-misses and stumble, tightening to firefly realization that forces stance with on-page endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Particulars of starlight wounds vs. firefly shield emerge theme of life's stubborn persistence, with grotto image resonantly reweighting dreams without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Isolde POV with perceptual bias toward dream-warmth amid cold menace; dialogue distinct (wheezed plea vs. softly commanding), subtext advances pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and high density propel via images like "dripping luminescent, caustic fluid"; no loops or artifacts dull the charged firefly/grotto closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bleeding stars as wounds repelled by seasonal fireflies synthesizes cosmic horror into fresh seasonal stewardship, inevitable from dream motif and grotto pull.</comment>
