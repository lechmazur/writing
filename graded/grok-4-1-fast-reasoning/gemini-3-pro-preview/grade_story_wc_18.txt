<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation to capture the dream roots deeply in mirror-maker traits, intensifying through embodied strain; micro-choices like planting boots reveal hierarchy of values with visible anchoring cost. Interiority concrete and particular, with no stock phrasing. Final endurance against ethereal pull earns change without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as synchronized breathing accumulates density, culminating in on-page RR (Charged Poise) where boundary snaps and world transforms with legible cost in burning lungs and frozen footing. Orientation anchors swiftly in first paragraph. Single tightening via sextant lock suffices, no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog, mud, and twilight frost constrain choices (anchoring vs. sweep) and charge final mirrored world image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens via POV's glassy precision, e.g., "air ripple like molten silica." Details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream sans entrapment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via loosening physics and snapping boundary, forcing endurance with on-page cost in "lungs burning with the cold fire." Agency in ritual narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of boundary erasure emerges organically via ritual turning world to glass; final ringing touch reconfigures unlived life as monument without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like ice cathedral, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in refractive, crystalline diction matching mirror-maker; rhythmic modulation builds to peak compression in "boundary...snapped." No elision or head-hopping; voice texture distinct and pressure-calibrated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring ritual pulse; metaphors cohere around glass/reflection without muddle, e.g., "jagged diamonds" to "vast, mirrored surface." Zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts; closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-capture alchemy via broken sextant and breath-sync transforms surreal tropes organically; risk in surreal escalation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via maker's logic.</comment>
