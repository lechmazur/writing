<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadow integration via stitching embodies contradictory impulses (rage as brother to saint), earning closure choice with visible agony cost; pacifist fear drives prior failures, complicating wholeness without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds textural density to RR closure (door yields post-integration) with felt cost; tear's prior rejection as constraint shapes causal deepening without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Photo residue and magnetized needle as micro-setting constrain stitching choice; reactor hum mirrors psychic decay, charging final floating image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stitching deepens stake by forcing repression/wholeness trade-off under agency; nausea/rage cost unmistakably alters tactics to enlightenment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final floating push reweights premise—pacifism via balanced darkness—resonating through shadow motif shift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with gravitational emotion signature; rhythmic modulation from trudging to ecstatic sustains pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; coherent metaphors (solidified moonlight) heighten stitching peak without loops or drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shadow-stitching via grief-crystals synthesizes pacifism and metaphysics into inevitable, risky closure; transforms tropes irreplaceably.</comment>
