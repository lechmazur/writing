<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in rejecting oblivion drives her to endure mental flaying, with embodied strain (sweat, gasping, trembling legs) revealing contradictory impulses of pain versus determination. Final act earned by prior visualization buildup. Internal voice particular to alchemist's gritty worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visualized details builds to bottle's storm, Charged Poise closure as she raises it with felt cost (agony, heat). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene causality intact, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: lanterns' glow flares mirroring psychic surge, cove's isolation enforces mental isolation constraining the conception. Body as micro-setting (calloused hands, hot palms) charges final raise. POV-filtered through alchemist's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival via conception) signaled early, escalates via deepening density/strain under Accumulative lens, narrowing to final push with agency in adding flaws. Cost legible in "mind flayed" and trembling. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gritty struggle over oblivion emerges organically from visualizing "greed, hunger, ambition" and denying silence. Final image reweights premise: messy glory vs. void. No moralizing, resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (alchemical precision on "paradox of glass," strain-degraded thought). Rhythmic buildup modulates tension. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from setup to peak ("vibrating with... thousand heartbeats"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Closure image sharp, propulsion aligns with strain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-wish ghost town revived by alchemical cognitive genesis into sealed bottle transforms genie trope boldly. Risk in mental athletics pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
