<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's expertise as arcane linguist drives micro-choices like analyzing fungi omission, earning the gamble with embodied tension; Traveler's brief rasp reveals flawed refusal confronting cost. Contradictory impulses act in the negotiation gamble, fulfilling 9+ test. Minor ding for Traveler's underdeveloped interiority as secondary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: diary clue → gap research → negotiation DC → web-cutting rescue → escape reconfiguration, with legible cost in Traveler's aged burden and mountain's thrumming pressure. Orientation anchored by para 1; closure lands on-page as mountain's satisfied hum reweights premise. 9+ test met with persistent diary constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting (fossilized encyclopedias, ink-black ivy, pulsating fungi) constrains choices (moss analysis on golem) and charges final slumber image; sensory hierarchy (unheard symphony pressure on temples) reflects Elara's linguistic bias. Fulfills 9+ gate via environment shaping negotiation pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant rescue stake signaled early tightens via golem reversal, narrowing options through intellectual gamble over magic; agency in renegotiation forecloses combat path with felt reserve cost. Escalation causal under lens; 9+ test met with unmistakable on-page price in golem pause.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of seeking textual gaps emerges organically via diary omission unlocking unlearned lessons; final whisper ("looking for what was missing") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting Traveler's tragedy refusal. Fulfills 9+ test without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (syntax of silence, grammar of stone); rhythmic control modulates intensity (rustling paper skin at climax). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; 9+ test met, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy negotiation lines amid lush description); purposeful metaphors integrate without muddle, propelling via "unheard symphony" motif. Minor scaffold in opening atmospheric stack (−0.1), but no loops or closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living bookstore ecology and linguistic rescue transforms tropes; fungi gap as ingenuity pivot feels inevitable from diary setup. Bold conceptual commitment heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
