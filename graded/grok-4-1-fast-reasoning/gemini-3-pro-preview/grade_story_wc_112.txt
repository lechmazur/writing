<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's obsession as obliging mechanic shines in contradictory impulses: jury-rigging the array despite compliance, culminating in the wrench pickup that earns stasis with the cost of secrecy. Interiority particular via mechanic's tactile grounding ("steady, vibrating heat"). Final renunciation forecloses escape, visibly costing authentic self-expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to holographic vision, closing with CR in "holding the warmth of the secret truth close to his chest against the biting cold"—exact image of conceptual cost (proof gained, linear life endured). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station's stratosphere perch and Weavers constrain choices (perfect conditions dictate timing); "mechanically warm" device/icy wind duality charges final wrench image, mirroring internal reweighting. Sensory hierarchy mechanic-specific (prism alignment, lever clank). Vivid, purposeful integration elevates to 9+ test pass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via activation/revelation that narrows options (sees proof, feels urge but endures). Lever pull drives agency; cost legible in return to "linear present" pretense. Minor slip: internal conflict declaration slightly abstracts pre-pull tension, but closure pressure intact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths vs. duty emerges organically via particulars: Weavers' ghosts stepping sideways reweights Elian's life as foreclosed path, final wrench image resonating without moral. Complexity in obsession's plausibility avoids binaries. 9+ test: non-literal answer in secret-held warmth recharges premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature: mechanic's obsession filters via "impossible geometry" and tactile proofs ("heat seeping into his gloves"). Rhythmic modulation accelerates at activation; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task (e.g., "icy warmth that made his skin prickle" advances setting/emotion/momentum). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative controlled ("sky a bruise") supports tone without muddle in peak vision beat. Zero scaffold in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanic proves sideways time via moth holograms, transforming sci-fi tropes through grounded obsession and CR closure. Risk in lateral-step metaphor heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable premise inflections feel inevitable in wrench return.</comment>
