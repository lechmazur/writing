<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like encoding fractals on silk, revealing logical dreamer traits under pressure; motivation intensifies through precise crafting. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits 9+; competence dominates without deep blind-spot struggle. Final endurance of hope feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure: "The equation had finally balanced," reconfiguring world with felt cost in recoiling entropy. Orientation anchored early in grotto; single scene coherent, no ambiguity. Persistent gauge constraint shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ozone over salt, mist-turning rock) filter through POV's mathematical lens, constraining ascent. Grotto walls' mirrors charge final revitalization image, mirroring internal states subtly. Micro-setting (gauge, silk) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revitalize vs. entropy) signaled early, tightens via balloon's encoded ascent narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Agency in release forecloses resignation path; cost legible in "frantic spinning" gauge and recoiling gray. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of engineered hope emerges organically from geometric encoding to balanced equation, reweighting premise in final vibrant waves without moralizing. Returning fractals/Möbius shift meaning at closure; ambiguity in parallel shadows invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (calculus on visions, silent roar paradox); rhythmic modulation heightens serene pressure. No head-hopping; diction reflects logical dreamer's lexicon consistently to end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gold leaf singing as patterns locked"); rhythmic variety propels without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors consistent and voice-motivated (Möbius defying space); zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math-encoded trial balloons transforms multiverse tropes via specific geometry; risk-taking in surreal ascent (rock to mist) heightens stakes organically. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
