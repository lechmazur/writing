<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jaren's motivation rooted in singular drive, with embodied contradictory emotions (knees buckle from anxious elation) compelling the scar-linking choice; Elara's visionary role forces his obedience. Internal conflict shows in jittery terror bound to hope during psychic run. Final knowledge gain earned with visible physical cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: approach → reveal catalyst → scar link → psychic maze → nexus vision → path internalized (CR closure). Clipping-to-dust and Elara's slump provide legible cost in final lines. Orientation anchored early (cobalt sky, glade, Elara); single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (ozone/moss smell, pulsating creepers constrain steps) mirrors urgency and POV curiosity; cobalt sky presses like bruised thumb, evolving to night. Micro-setting (roots, scars) charges vision beat and final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize madness via dream intersection) signaled early, tightens causally through painful link and maze run narrowing to nexus. Agency in heeding geometry forecloses chaos path with embodied cost (cold jolt, panic grounded). Escalation driven by Jaren's pursuit under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of order vs. chaotic growth emerges organically via covenant flare in vision; subtext in scarred fusion reweights man-nature boundary. Final nexus forge image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, satisfying 9+ test. No tidy binaries, ambiguity in survival tools lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Jaren with perceptual signature (purposefully curious gaze filters fear); diction/rhythm modulates tension (short gasps amid dense vision). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Heed the geometry" advances plot). No head-hopping, elision taught via scars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (long descriptive swells to jolt-sharp vision beats); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion clear in "tiny sprig unfolded into towering hedges," advancing causality. Zero artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal collapse, scar-neural links, and psychic yew maze transforms sci-fi tropes into inevitable nexus payoff. Risky root-bound character and covenant premise cohere organically. Final path-burned-in-mind feels non-obvious yet earned.</comment>
