<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied from "lungs seizing" to mirror's truth, with contradictory grief/resolve impulses acting in the climb and stance; earned renunciation of drowning in ghosts via prior memory assault, with visible cost in coexistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure in "brittleness was gone, replaced by a tensile strength," cost legible in foreclosed victimhood; orientation anchored early in awakening/balcony; single shard fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Obsidian disc as micro-setting constrains choice and charges final self-image; sensory selection (hum in teeth, cold stone) purposeful and POV-biased to history; cloud-tide evolves causally, pressuring descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled in opening grief, deepens via mirror reversal narrowing to coexistence; agency in seeking circle/steps off disc forecloses loss-echo with felt emotional cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of past-as-witness emerges organically from particulars like Sun-Drinkers' silence to final "she was their witness"; resonant non-literal answer in assured steps reweights isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature haunted by extinctions; rhythmic modulation peaks in vibration's "rattle her bones"; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm syncing to resonance peak; no loops or scaffolds, strategic telling compresses backstory; zero figurative muddle in closure image of tensile strength.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation grief and quantum mirror in cloud-tide world transforms isolation trope; risk in sci-fantasy blend (atomically reflective) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
