<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses in the deliberate freeze versus dive urge, earning the final grafting endurance; minor therapy-speak in "somatic markers" slightly detaches peak panic without cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation and textural density tightening from whine trigger to Charged Poise closure in the graft union, cost legible in "scar tissue and heavy silence" persisting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum constrains via wind-whine trigger mimicking drone and supplies cliff pine for graft, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (loam/jasmine vs salt spray) mirrors Elias's botanical bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>PTSD endurance stake deepens texturally through pearl/photo tactics narrowing panic options, with agency in micro-choices; cost felt in shaky exhale but lacks one more visible trade-off charging graft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchid-pine graft as non-literal answer reweights trauma-hope theme from fragile beauty to gnarled persistence, emerging organically without moralizing; photo reprise subtly charges conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature blending botanical precision ("chlorophyll and root structures") and trauma fragments; rhythmic modulation peaks in panic compression without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from storm rattle to graft glint; coherent metaphors (fragile lung, pearl) avoid muddle, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh PTSD-gardening synthesis transforms survival trope via grafting metaphor; bold internal techniques heighten stakes, but premise echoes familiar trauma-recovery arcs without full subversion.</comment>
