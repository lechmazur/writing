<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in concrete traits (astrologer seeking belonging) and earns change via feather placement at climax, with embodied conflict in her whisper about climbing. Kael applies pressure through ingenious tuning, forcing her immersion. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("scattered pieces of her spirit") but does not touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from void to firefly cascade, tightening via Kael's emitters to CR closure in feather's release with conceptual cost (past failure foreclosed). Orientation anchored early ("Station Nadir...underwater city"). One meaningful deepening suffices; time constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via dome and emitters, charging final swarm image; body/attention narrows to glass chill and breath fog. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's bias (celestial patterns in bioluminescence). Feather as micro-setting recurs, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) signaled early, tightens texturally in "swarm enveloped the dome" forcing stance crystallization; agency in shared exhale forecloses observer role with felt cost (feather offering). Pressure coheres without reversal overload; sunrise live clock narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: belonging as fluid light reweights star-map premise via firefly patterns, resonating in final image without statement. Subtext in feather's evolution from scar to offering; ambiguity lingers in "pulsing in time." No moralizing; counter-reading (deep vs. surface) viable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (geometric patterns in swarm); dialogue natural/subtextual ("stars...sink") pursues goals. Rhythm modulates to compression at peak ("cascade...living galaxy"). Minor register elevation voice-motivated for lyric immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, syntax supports immersion ("shadowseam wonder" inventive). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("luminous respite...fluid movements") dense but purposeful for textural lens, not obscuring closure. No loops; feather image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ostracods as sunk stars transforms trope organically, with landscape astrologer yielding fresh premise; feather reprise inevitable in hindsight. Risk in underwater lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
