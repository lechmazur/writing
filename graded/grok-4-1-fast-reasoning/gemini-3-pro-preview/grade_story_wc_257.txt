<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to resurrect grief through craft is embodied in precise actions like folding the raven and pressing ash, earning the woman's transformation; her "gray tension" breaking shows credible change without epiphanies. Minor slip: woman's interiority inferred via posture, not deeply particularized, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from summoning to holographic projection; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with cost ("ash remained dead") legible in final image of blooming light over heart. Orientation anchored early in observatory; fluid time serves pattern without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's glass walls, ozone scent, and updraft constrain summoning and view downward, charging the raven toss; celestial charts static against "golden twilight" mirror timeless craft. Final projection uses loupes, press, and flame tactilely, mirroring internal resurrection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of alchemizing grief tightens texturally via stencil integration and illumination, forcing realization of "intention"; woman's gasp forecloses her folded state with felt cost. Agency in Elias's process drives escalation without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of messy ruin to "manufactured perfection" emerges via ash-to-diamond and holographic lilies, reweighting intention in final projection without statement; "lie made of truth" subtext charges closure image organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable on Elias's perceptual bias (charcoal-stained fingers, quiet ardor); voice rhythmic and selective, modulating to intensity in "low, thrumming vibration." Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven in her whisper and his diagnosis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pristine construct built from messy ruin" advances theme/prose); rhythm varies, no loops, though minor figurative density in opening ("burned quietly beneath his ribs") purposeful for tone. Propulsion clear to flame-illumined climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash-diamond holography transforms grief tropes via "genuinely artificial" gem and stencil projection; risk in fluid time and raven-summoning heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
