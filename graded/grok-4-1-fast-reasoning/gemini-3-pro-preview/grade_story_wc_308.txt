<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied mastery via calloused thumb on serrated edge and auditory expansion; decades-trapped limit drives inevitable sync with past pulse, earning displacement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: bird appraisal to arrowhead throw builds density to ancient pulse intersection as CR closure; cost legible in "eluded him for decades" before walking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and layered dust constrain skimming path; crow spirals map air currents, charging throw and final "memory of the echo" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to navigate immobile tightens via pulse sync narrowing to total displacement; agency in throw forecloses physical trial with shattered arrowhead price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sync of fresh melody with "wandering" pulse reweights sound-over-sight premise; final route-burned mind offers resonant answer without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Auditory perceptual signature ("vicious hum," "shivered through the dust") biases noticing; rhythmic compression peaks in "racing toward the canyon’s mouth."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; syntax varies to propel from "coiled...spring" to shattering climax, clarifying cause in interference bloom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sonic ricochet in ossified canyon transforms labyrinth trope; bird-air mapping to pulse-sync feels inevitable, risking acoustic synesthesia payoff.</comment>
