<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in hovering over toggle then unhooking rope; final renunciation earned by obsession and embodied checks, with cost of superiors' scrutiny legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as stillness density builds to Earned Stasis closure; orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elias, sanctuary, solstice); cost crystalized in "he would have to explain," reconfiguring protocol path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via anomaly stillness pressuring toggle hesitation; rope and sensor as micro-setting charge final wrap-around image; sensory hierarchy (acoustic void, ice shift) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protocol test vs. silence) signaled early, tightens via wind dying to perfect equilibrium; agency in kill switch forecloses path with explanatory cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence over arrogance emerges via particulars like rope swing and ice shift; final "pendulum marking a time of peace" reweights premise non-literally, with conceptual cost of unheeded warning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature fixates on sound gradients (howl to void); rhythmic control modulates from flapping coat to crystalline quiet without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; propulsion via varied syntax matches hush build to peak stillness; no figurative muddle even in "bruising purple shadows."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of siren-tester renouncing noise amid anomaly feels inevitable from data obsession; risk of quiet stasis heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
