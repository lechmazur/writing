<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to map the void is clear and intensifies through ritual micro-choices like trapping the gold flake; embodied emotion in calloused finger and feverish hand reveals character under pressure. Internal conflict subtle in balancing wind's threat against ambered hush, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to star's extinction and storm's vanish as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting preparation with cost of total dark. Orientation anchored early in ridge fort and final star; one tightening via last star's pulse suffices, closure legible with gold flake's placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like wind's roar gaps and marbled hush constrain mapping choices; recurring stones and booklet charge final tactile tracing in dark. Environment mirrors internal void through purposeful selection, no white-room; body as micro-setting (knees, fingertips) elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map endless night signaled early, escalates via silence patterns and star's slowing pulse under Accumulative lens, narrowing to final flake placement. Agency in endurance forecloses light-dependent paths with felt cost in grayed pages; one decisive deepening charges poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of charting oblivion emerges organically from ritual failures (spoken words feed wind) and final image's gold-tomb map reweighting preparation's premise. Resonance in silence's texture avoids moralizing; CR form ties arc to conceptual cost of eternal night without tidy insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in textured silences and degradations; rhythmic modulation peaks in feverish mapping without filter excess. Prose texture distinct in syntax echoing hush's weight; no dialogue, elisions purposeful and taught early for lyric payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm in short gust sentences; hush variants purposeful pattern, not loop. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (marbled hush veins) dulls one peak beat slightly; closure image clear, no scaffold obscuring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy ritual via silence-mapping transforms end-times trope; risk in textural drive heightens stakes through gold's decay mirroring galaxies. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging; bold perceptual hush innovates without gimmick.</comment>
