<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reckless idealist motivation compels ritual choices with embodied tenderness ("caressing the rough wood and brittle bone"); internal conflict in trading certainty for sister's joy earns closure renunciation with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene (reckless haste vs. gentle precision). No unearned epiphanies or label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sigil density and ritual symbols build to Resonant Reconfiguration (redemption inlaid, but Elian "empty now") with felt cost in final slump against bone wall. Orientation anchored early ("catacomb orchard"); single scene causality tight, no ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard details constrain choices ("threadbare" fate demands delicacy) and charge final image (slump against "bone-studded wall"). Sensory hierarchy (groaning roots rattle teeth) reflects urgency; setting evolves causally with sap surge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renegotiate barter for sister's joy) tightens via resistance ("air grew thick," roots groan), forcing agency in offering certainty; cost unmistakable in "letting his belief... bleed out." Escalation driven by protagonist under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial redemption emerges from ritual particulars (sigils snare joy, sap sends golden light); final image reweights bartered destinies non-literally ("new meaning... redemption") without moralizing. Resonance from want/need friction (repair vs. personal void).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (semiotic lens: "scratching microscopic sigils"); voice texture modulates rhythmically under stress (short sentences in groan beat). No head-hopping or withholding; diction purposeful for ritual intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (every line advances ritual/atmosphere); rhythm varies (long descriptive swells to terse climax: "The sap surged"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion peaks in "golden light that shot upward."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of semiotic magic in bone orchard transforms tropes organically; risk in "inlaying meaning" yields inevitable closure (redemption via self-torn holes). Non-obvious premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
