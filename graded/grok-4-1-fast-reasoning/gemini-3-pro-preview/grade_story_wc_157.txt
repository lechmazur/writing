<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Julian's rogue charm shines in riddle-speaking to overload auditors and decisive seed toss under raid pressure, earning defiance; Aris provides crucible contrast without depth overload. Limited contradictory impulses in scene slightly tempers peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: raid breach therefore seed toss creates DC paradox disrupting scanners, with legible cost in "twelve good men" and final void image. Orientation anchors early in greenhouse; single scene tightens impeccably to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse's turbine and pheromones constrain tactics—dampen scanners, amplify seed—charging warped climax; sensory hierarchy (insects roar, wet loam) reflects urgency and Julian's priorities. Recurrent glass ceiling evolves with drone smash and distortion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver disruptive seed) signaled early, causal escalation via sirens/boots/door ram narrows to toss with agency and cost (system crash, officers kneel); one tightening suffices, foreclosing capture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Defiance vs. taxable thoughts emerges via analog seed/flowers subverting digital logic, resonant in "beautiful, silent void" repricing control without moralizing; final image reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in cryptic noticing (riddles overheat processors); dialogue distinct—Julian's wit vs. Aris's hiss—advances goals with subtext; rhythm modulates to climax compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and embodied images; minor metaphor density in warp ("stretch and fold") purposeful, not muddled. No loops; climax rhythm accelerates cleanly to "free man."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thought-tax dystopia with analog seed paradox transforms tropes; gourd runes as "weapon of mass disruption" inevitable from flower codes, risking bold chaos payoff.</comment>
