<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to realign "diverted currents" for hope feels rooted and intensifies through micro-choices like valve manipulation; embodied creativity shines in the sextant improvisation. Minor slip: "functionally creative" borders on diagnostic label without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure in hologram bloom with conceptual cost of realigned history via refuse. Orientation anchored early in spaceport post-carnival; single scene causality clear from discovery to ignition, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport's debris and sub-flooring constrain choices (e.g., kinetic runoff redirection) and charge final stardust image; sensory details (hissing air, blue wash) selective via engineer's bias. Recurring "maze" architecture mirrors internal reconfiguration perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove decline reversible) signaled early, tightens via missing crystal forcing sextant improvisation with felt risk in "delicate operation." Agency in redirects narrows options under Accumulative lens; conceptual cost legible in stoic final note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" theme emerges organically from clashing layouts to resolved hologram clarity, reweighting exploration vs. consumption without statement. Final image offers non-literal resonance on restoration's viability, embracing ambiguity in "quiet theorem."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in architectural metaphors ("circulatory systems," "vein that still carried blood"); rhythmic modulation builds to stoic wonder. No head-hopping, diction controlled and biased toward engineer's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors accelerating to climax turbine spin; varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor artifact: paraphrase loops in reflective blocks ("dead ends, only diverted currents"; "dormant potential rather than inevitable decay") dull momentum slightly pre-escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival refuse unlocking stellar hologram transforms abandonment trope via engineer's ingenuity; risk in prop-as-crystal improvisation heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious "fake tool for fake sailor now guiding real ship" inflects closure inevitably.</comment>
