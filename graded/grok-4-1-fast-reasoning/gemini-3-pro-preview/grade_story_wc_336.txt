<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses between disciplined subtraction and creative sculpting propel the graft; embodied exhaustion and soul-light burden earn the final forward gaze. Minor flaw in limited visible struggle, as competence dominates without compounding mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from seed hold to weaving and descent; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "resonance... hummed in his bones" with felt exhaustion cost. Orientation anchored early at parapet/void; single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and glowing mist constrain the weaving act and charge final hush-deepening image; sensory integration (mist glow, swirling smoke) mirrors internal priorities without catalog. POV bias filters through orchard lens effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to infuse wonder tightens accumulatively through snip-to-weave deepening, narrowing to seamless integration under exhaustion; agency in hands' dance forecloses failure path. Cost legible in "exhausting, yet... demanded," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of creative preservation emerges organically from pruning/sculpting tension, resonating in final "flower in the wasteland" image that reweights stagnation without moralizing. Particulars like nebula-core seed avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with orchard-perceptual signature (braid, graft, rootstock) modulates lyrically under process intensity; rhythmic prose distinct and voice-motivated for fantastical hush. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors integrated into action; varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor figurative density in weaving beat borders overwrite. Closure image crisp, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard-pruning multiverse graft transforms dimensional tropes through grounded tactile acts; risk in solo fantastical process heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight payoff.</comment>
