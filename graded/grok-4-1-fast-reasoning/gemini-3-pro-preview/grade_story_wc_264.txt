<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dispersion moment embodies contradictory self-loss for duty, with shuddering return earning endurance; motivation rooted in sparks cultivation intensifies via quantum price, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via ritual buildup to Charged Poise closure; chess clock at eternal midnight denies time with dreamless cost legible in final touch; orientation anchored early in dune/climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silica petals chime under boots and dim at relief, constraining ritual positioning and charging final sighing hush; selective senses (crunch, ozone taste) filter through Kaelen's probabilistic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to sustain archive tightens accumulatively in dispersion reversal, narrowing self to archive interface with felt cost in violent shudder; agency in song forces trade-off endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Preservation-through-sacrifice emerges organically from sparks/flares and self-dissolution; final hush image reweights withered actuality vs. potential without moral, inviting ambiguous linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in wave equations and probabilistic noticing; fractured syntax/rhythm mirrors dispersion terror, modulating purposefully under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms in lullaby build; purposeful metaphors (trapped moths, smeared consciousness) cohere without muddle or loops in dispersion peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quantum song as wave-function charm synthesizes archive/clock into inevitable fresh preservation frame; risk in dispersion price heightens stakes organically.</comment>
