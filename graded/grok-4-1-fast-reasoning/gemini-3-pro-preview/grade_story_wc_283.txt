<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (maintenance yields to revolution) and final inversion earned by button-tuning causality with embodied cost in swirling sand. Quiet inspiration shown via graceful fingers amid slow process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of button filters breaks discord pattern into harmony, yielding CR closure in hourglass inversion where stagnant sand swirls chaotically, reweighting fate with conceptual cost of dismantled doom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Warehouse walls of solidified sap constrain echo bounces, forcing button-tuning choices; jar, buttons, hourglass as micro-settings charge final image of flowing sand and fading script.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to unscramble prophecy signaled early, tightens via accumulating harmony from chaos under Accumulative lens, agency in spiral arrangement foreclosing fatalism with felt cost in unified pulse and inverted glass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shared wisdom emerges organically from chorus of button-resonances turning doom to cycles; final image of blank stone and possibility reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (reverent noticing of resonances); rhythmic diction modulates from heavy silence to pulsing harmony under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful figures (e.g., "tangled knot of fears" resolving to pulse) propel without loops or muddle; zero artifacts dull closure sand-flow image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic prophecy tuned by emotional debris transforms fatalism trope; button-spiral inevitability grows from warehouse particulars, bold without gimmick.</comment>
