<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied realization of transformation as fluid/surrender, earned by micro-choices like releasing bugs despite mesmerization; contradictory impulses in assuming "rough grain" vs. actual fluidity compel final change with felt cost of total emptiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of hush/light building to pattern break (bugs seep into sand, mountain sighs); on-page CR closure legible in "hands empty once more" yielding fullness, with cost in surrendered last possession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains precisely: black sand heat halts Silas at exact second for zenith reflection, fissure/pull to pool guides release; vivid sensory hush/vibration charges final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grasp transformation amid eruption threat) tightens via textural escalation (hush intensifies to marrow hum, bugs spiral/resonate); agency in releases forecloses safe flight path with visible cost of bugs' dispersal and personal void.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unplanned surrender emerges organically from giving arc and accidental soothing; final image of dispersing bugs reweights "texture" premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (texture obsession in "rough grain," "fluid and incandescent"); rhythmic modulation builds hush density purposefully, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated figuration (e.g., "whispering hush" pattern-taught, pays off in tectonic listening); zero loops/artifacts, clear propulsion through peak release beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philanthropy fulfilling volcano prophecy via bioluminescent "currency"; risk in textural hush/accidental cosmic alignment transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight via giving history.</comment>
