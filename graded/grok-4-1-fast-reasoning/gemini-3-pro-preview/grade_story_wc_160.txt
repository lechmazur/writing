<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation rooted in compassion vs. laws drives micro-choices like chaining during the breath; embodied tremble at climax reveals contradiction under pressure. Interiority concrete via adrenaline and purpose clarity. Final endurance of treason risk earns closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: adhesive discovery → blueprint → chain use → sabotage success as Decisive Change. Orientation anchored early in amphitheater/volcano. Closure cost legible in "if the chain snapped" heartbeat, with chain holding reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Volcano's thermal "breathing" constrains timing and hides sabotage, charging climax. Sensory details (groans, heat waves, thrumming) selective via Elian's machinist lens. Evolving environment mirrors tension in walls widening/contracting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save Outer Ring vs. Council) signaled early, tightens causally at wheel haul where tremble narrows options. Agency in measured chain restraint forces trade-off with snap risk. Cost visible in taut clink and false gauges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden mercy emerges via adhesive blueprint and sabotage, reweighted in final "ghost in the machine" image without statement. Subtext in mundane objects enabling compassion avoids tidy moral. Resonance from particulars like chain reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with machinist perceptual bias (gears shriek, gauges settle). Voice texture poetic yet precise, modulating rhythm at peak ("tension was absolute"). No head-hopping; diction fits stressed ingenuity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion syncing action (wheel haul shakes floor); varied rhythm avoids monotony. Minor overwriting in "dappled resolve" metaphor slightly muddles peak clarity, but no loops obscure cause/effect at chain clink.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of volcano hydraulics, adhesive encryption, and physical chain tricking sensors transforms tropes organically. Risky conceit of "building breathes" heightens stakes via constraint, inevitable in hindsight at thrumming success.</comment>
