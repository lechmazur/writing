<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in embodied sensations like the "caustic" joy burning through him during visions, earning the final endurance to override with toxic hope; flaws complicate without safety-hedging. Backstory anchors concretely to present hunt without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perturbations build rippling density to visions then collapse; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with legible cost in "left with nothing but the humming machinery and the cold, hard truth." Orientation anchors immediately. Lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode and viewport constrain choices (tapping sends perturbation, glass separates from ghosts) and charge final inert grip; zero-gravity and ticking metal selectively mirror internal hunt urgency. Sensory hierarchy physics-biased, spatial choreography precise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to access unused potential signaled early, tightens texturally via deepening visions and aggressive push risking reset; agency drives escalation, cost unmistakable in collapse foreclosing connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief's mathematical ghosts emerges organically, final reach to "break the world just to see the beautiful ruins" offers resonant reconfiguration reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses physics poetry ("mathematical ghosts of what should have been") with stable close-third POV; rhythmic control modulates tension peaks without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (no muddle); zero loops or scaffolds, closure image crisp under read-aloud ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of quantum grief and perturbation theory feels inevitable; bold sci-fi conceit transforms tropes, risk heightens stakes through irreplaceable Geode logic.</comment>
