<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—passive grief masking calculated tapping—act simultaneously, earning the final fusion choice with sanity cost; interiority embodied in vibrations through bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as tapping density escalates garden reaction to resonant reconfiguration; closure fuses realities on-page at "hush of the universe inhaling," with sanity trade legible as scientists rush abandoned body.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound Wave Garden constrains tapping choices and evolves causally from white to violet to golden waves, charging final lagoon image; sensory hierarchy (vibrations, ozone) filters through Kael's sonic focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (permanent Lena sanctuary) tightens accumulatively via garden override and neural pull; agency in tempo increase forecloses physical world with on-page sanity cost felt in blurring edges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-stricken permanence emerges from particulars like violet shift and auroral bands; final hand-holding reconfigures holding-on vs. letting-go without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward sonic embodiment; rhythmic prose modulates from subtle tapping to charged hush, heightening pressure legibly.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring vibrations, but minor overwrought metaphors ("celestial curtain") slightly blur peak propulsion without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of bio-acoustic garden and memory entanglement transforms tropes into inevitable dream-reality trade; risk-taking in sonic sabotage heightens stakes organically.</comment>
