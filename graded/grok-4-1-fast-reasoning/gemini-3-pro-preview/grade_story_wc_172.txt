<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—destroying the ecosystem yet mourning its birds—act simultaneously in the egg release, earning the sentimental gamble with doomed cost; interiority particular via "burn a library...weep over the ashes."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to Charged Poise closure in the rain drop on parched earth, reweighting paradox with conceptual cost of irreducible sentiment; orientation anchors immediately, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt flat's cracks constrain fissure choice and charge final "broken porcelain" image mirroring internal fracture; sensory hierarchy (salt dust on shoes, heat shimmer) filters through Vance's pilgrim reverence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (preserve echo amid self-made hell) deepens accumulatively via sentiment layers, foreclosing viable options like cloning with visible cost in the "statistically zero" hatchling's fate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Paradox of destruction/charity emerges organically from particulars, final image offering non-literal resonant answer ("selfish, cruel, and tender") that reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (reverent cartography in cracks, phantom flock) and rhythmic modulation from stillness to wind-whistle; diction lyrical yet grounded in Vance's tasteful hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("blinding geometry," "tattered veil," "broken porcelain") slightly muddles peak release beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral empire-builder's doomed sentiment transforms drought trope into soul-paradox, with risk-taking in lyric closure heightening conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
