<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in layering process, with embodied emotion in "vibrate with a constructed sorrow"; motivation rooted in ghost-liberation endures consistently. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the on-page ritual caps below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragments to heavy label, cadence shift in placement as "monument to a despair that might never have happened, yet felt entirely true" delivers CR with conceptual cost of synthetic validity. Orientation anchored early in port ghost-life; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Port labyrinth vividly filters through POV bias as "vaults of erased histories," constraining sleep/shadows and charging final crack-placement; tides evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Recurrent containers/tides proportioned to key moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor unremembered) signaled early, deepens texturally via layering irony/sorrow on poison, foreclosing factual truth with felt emotional weight; one tightening sufficient, but external pressure subtle/internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of synthetic memory emerges organically from debris-ritual, final image reweights "official world demands names" vs. "density of feeling" with resonant ambiguity; no moralizing, complexity in "might never have happened, yet felt entirely true."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in emotional residue on steel; rhythmic prose modulates with ritual intensity, POV stable/single; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative layering purposeful/pattern-taught without muddle in peak ritual. Minor density in metaphors contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-archivist layering audio scraps on debris transforms isolation trope; bold perceptual filter and port-ritual risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at monument-placement.</comment>
