<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's reticence yields to bold testimony via crystal-amplified whispers, earning shift with embodied fear (trembling hand, raspy voice); final "weathered innocence" reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as whispers build density to sun-pierced realization; CR lands on-page in fractal loop epiphany, reweighting language cage with conceptual cost of fear shed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Library acoustics and dawn light constrain testimony direction (rotunda pivot); crystal/moss charge final image, with sensory hush evolving to electrical tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to decode moss tightens via syntax break under agency of fractured testimony; fear's cost unmistakable in "shed his lifetime of fear" at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moss spirals and broken syntax reconfigure dead-language premise implicitly; final charged air offers non-literal answer to stasis-vs-growth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature on patterns (spirals, facets); fractured dialogue rhythmically mirrors voice, modulating from rasp to strength without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High-density propulsion via varied syntax; "sun... igniting the crystal... blinding star" exemplifies clear rhythm without loops or muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sonic crystal and moss-key transform library trope into linguistic rebirth; risk of fractured syntax heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
