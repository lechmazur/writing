<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harlin's balanced curiosity and interior conflict shine in embodied details like trembling hand through Orion and heart's rhythm, earning the final endurance of clutching the anchor amid success's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to simulation's sky reveal and collapse; CR closure lands via "somber marvel" realization reweighting entrapment with conceptual cost in final logbook/darkness image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Benthic dome's gauges and console constrain experiment; anchor object charges closure by contrasting tactile iron with phantom stars, filtering through navigator's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (star navigation) signaled early tightens via sensor expansion yielding sky, but agency-driven deepening forces trade-off in "profound and quiet heaviness" costing physical freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge's cage emerges organically from experiment to final image clutching anchor under stars, offering non-literal CR repricing surface dreams with undeniable entrapment cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in nautical-tactile noticing (pitted iron, star angles); rhythmic control modulates from setup poise to peak clarity and closure hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory integration; minor "balancedly curious" awkwardness doesn't touch closure, but no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alien edge geometry in submarine abyss transforms navigation trope; anchor-star contrast risks bold conceptual payoff inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
