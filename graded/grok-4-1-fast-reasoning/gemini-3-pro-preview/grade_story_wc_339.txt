<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's analytic micro-choices (pushing panic strands, grounding the globe) reveal a hierarchy of values with embodied cost, earning the closure renunciation; interiority concrete via vectors and decay rates. Minor flaw: "thermodynamics of grief" borders diagnostic abstraction without full embodied contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from psychic debris to isolated vortex, culminating in on-page RR (snow falls, threads dissolve) with legible cost in lighter library and clipped souvenir. Single scene coherent; orientation anchored early at Hesperus library.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library's silt, fog-pulp, and viscous currents constrain navigation and charge final image (lightens post-resolution); snow globe as micro-setting pulses kinetic memory. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward analytic anomalies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven untangling to deepening at desk, narrowing to hand-grounding with felt cost (psychic charge dissipation). Accumulative cadence shift reweights resistance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of denial's loop vs. release emerges organically from captain's vortex to peaceful snowfall, offering resonant non-literal answer in final blanket image that reweights grief's equation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct analytic perceptual signature (frequencies, vectors); rhythmic modulation heightens melancholy density without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "pushed aside a strand of panic, then a knot of regret"); no loops, clean syntax varies for ear, zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychic thermodynamics and shipwreck artifact transforms ghost tropes; snow globe transmission as inevitable crux risks bold analytic haunting, heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
