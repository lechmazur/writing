<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Heartbroken reaper's motivation rooted in embodied grief (hollowness lightening per creation) compels ritual choices with earned release; contradictory impulses (endings expert yet pierced by her loss) act in scene, final endurance of veil crossing forecloses path with felt cost in empty-air touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from adjustment to successive crystallizations toward Charged Poise closure ("Map complete" sigh reconfigures grief with emotional cost legible in final touch and blank page); orientation anchored early, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's brass gears/prisms constrain focalization of dying light, charging final image of glittering ornaments on blank page; sensory selectivity (cooling copper, humming air) mirrors reaper's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears to lift grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via each crystallization narrowing dread into harmless form with visible cost (ink stripped, chest lightens); agency in binding ritual tightens to Charged Poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice's echo transforming nebulous horror into tangible stasis emerges organically from ritual particulars; final blank-page ornaments reweight fears non-literally as "harmless solids," inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (skeletal hand, veil awareness) with rhythmic modulation under ritual intensity; diction/texture reflects reaper's distant poise, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels ritual beats; minor figurative density in crystallizations ("geometric form like growing diamond") purposeful without muddle or loops touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper mythos with alchemical light-ritual transforms sea-monster tropes into grief-resolution ornaments; risk in geometric fear-crystallization feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
