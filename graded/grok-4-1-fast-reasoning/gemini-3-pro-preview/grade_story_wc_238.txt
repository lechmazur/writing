<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's metaphors reveal character-specific worldview under pressure, earning the ritual's imperfect closure; embodied hollow ache at fee-taking shows contradiction between competence and emotional cost. Elena's trembling grip and choked apology drive stakes without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: generator hum → cork pop → manifestation → corrupted signal spike → power cut collapses field, yielding Charged Poise RR with legible cost in "he didn't smile" and permanent sorrow etching atmosphere. Orientation anchored early in archive; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive shelves constrain wiring cage and vibrate under field, charging climax; orchard hush outside acts as recurring pressure cooker mirroring ritual tension, repriced by final chainsaw roar breaking silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (viscous memory release for apology) signaled early, tightens causally via flickering ghost and red-line spike forcing cutoff; agency in Silas's yank and bark forecloses full resolution with frost-burn cost on Elena's cheek.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles emerge organically via "jagged shape," "silent scream," and "broken mirror" metaphor, reweighting apology premise in final "sorrow remained... unwashed and permanent" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Silas's "scratching like a rusty needle" voice and POV-stable diction (e.g., "grief is like water trapped"); dialogue subtextual, Elena's whisper vs. Silas's bark distinguishing idiom under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in ritual beats (e.g., "vapor twisted, snapping into the jagged shape"); minor figurative density in opening hush simile stack but coherent and propulsive, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Electromagnetic ghost-induction via copper in sheet archive transforms exorcism trope organically; fresh "remover of scandal" synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risk-taking in physics-metaphor fusion heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
