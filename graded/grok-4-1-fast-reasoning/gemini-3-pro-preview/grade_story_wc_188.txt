<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices reveal character under environmental pressure, like adjusting powders via dew slickness; interiority particular without epiphanies. Whimsical handling of danger ("treating the dangerous explosives with the whimsy of a parlor trick") shows contradiction without alternating summaries. Final endurance earned, but lacks deeper flaw complication for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (dusk to starless void) drives to display as Charged Poise closure, reconfiguring hopelessness with felt temporary cost in "crushing blackness...held at bay." Orientation anchored early (ramparts, fortress, dusk). Single scene coherent, mosaic note motivates without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vine-choked fortress and humidity constrain choices (powder adjustments, fuse placement), charging final "garden of living light" image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (thyme scent, dew slickness). Micro-setting (mosaic tiles) guides action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via discoveries (mosaic, humidity) narrowing to launch under lens; agency in spinning rag knot forecloses failure with refugee hope as visible payoff. One tightening (night plunge) suffices, but cost more conceptual than visceral for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of artificial light banishing gloom emerges from particulars (gold vines mirroring decay); final willow-shells offer resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in serious playfulness amid misery lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (chanting measures echo-silence, ambient gauges); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates purposefully from hum to "thunderous symphony." No head-hopping, voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("woosh-woosh" cuts silence), varied rhythm; figurative density purposeful in lyric mode but borders overwriting in prep beats, slightly dulling peak spin. No loops or scaffolds; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks alchemy in decaying fortress transforms tropes (hope in darkness) via mosaic recipe and rag knot; risk in whimsical danger heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from humidity calculus to supernova.</comment>
