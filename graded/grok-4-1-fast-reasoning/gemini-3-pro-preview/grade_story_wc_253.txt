<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's contradictory impulses—erasing love via absurd performance while staring at the bouquet—act in scene, earning the final emotional void with visible cost of self-betrayal. Interiority concrete and embodied (cold detachment, heart "still"); moral ambiguity drives micro-choices without labels. No therapy-speak flattens crisis; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whittling narration builds density to bouquet destruction, yielding CR closure in "remade hush" with conceptual cost of erased humanity ("nothing mattered, not even the woman"). Orientation anchored early (farmhouse, turbines, Mandate); one tightening via bouquet suffices. Cost legible in final dust pile and zero-gravity void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbines' shadows/shudders constrain visible-zone mask and mirror oppressive Mandate, charging final hush; bouquet as micro-setting evolves via destruction to dust. Sensory selective (strobing blades, dust motes, wood shavings). POV bias filters industrial threat vs fringe isolation perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lighten grief) signaled early; accumulative escalation via narration absurdifies wood, then bouquet, forcing trade-off in erasure with agency (knife slices). Cost unmistakable in final "terrifyingly still" heart and empty float. One decisive deepening charges image without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of survival-erasure emerges from whittling performance transmuting grief to "lightness," resonating in bouquet dust without moralizing. Final image reweights Mandate premise: hush as "manufactured quietude" with oblique cost of love's debris. Complexity in ambiguity lingers via moral trade-off.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature of clinical detachment biasing details (flowers as "Artifact," turbines as "mechanical heartbeat"). Rhythmic control modulates: booming narration vs whispered close. Performative "voice" distinct from internal hush; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels (shavings "drift like shed skin"); varied rhythm accelerates in narration bursts, breathes in void. Minor paraphrase in void descriptions (−0.3), but no loops touch closure; metaphors purposeful (buoyant grief, leaden anchor). Clean syntax, no artifacts dull peak dust beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Mandate forces absurd gladiatorial whittling of grief into hush, transforming dystopian trope via moral erasure. Risky performative narration heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight from mask/bouquet constraints. No derivative echoes; bold fringe vs manic city.</comment>
