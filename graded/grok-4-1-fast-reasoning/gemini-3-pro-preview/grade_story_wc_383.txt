<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic's contradictory impulses—analytical disdain vs. irresistible desire—act simultaneously in trembles and tears, earning the archival renunciation with embodied cost at "forced herself to witness the solidification."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as resonance hum builds density to violent compression; RR closure lands on-page in stone's inert weight and dissolving textures, with cost in "terrifying lightness of freedom."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet moss, crushed violets, suspension fields constrain ritual via buried resonance structures and charge final dissolution image; sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to hum and scream.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to archive quarantined memory tightens via agency-driven hum/press, foreclosing grief's seduction with on-page cost in tears and "heavy cloak of loneliness lift[ing]."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grief-as-parasite theme emerges organically from seashell feedback and radiant phantom; final awakening image offers resonant repricing of isolation into independence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature biases toward analytical textures ("fabric-like moss," "architectural" hum) that modulate rhythmically under stress; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated sensory propulsion ("air screamed as the memory was compressed"); zero loops, coherent metaphors, rhythm accelerates to silence's rush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh psychic surgery of grief via resonance archiving transforms mourning tropes; surreal garden's implications commit fully, with ritual's inevitability heightening stakes riskily yet legibly.</comment>
