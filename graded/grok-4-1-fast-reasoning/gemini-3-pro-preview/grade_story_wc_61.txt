<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentimentalist traits drive obsessive motivation and micro-choice to insert imperfect gear despite sorrow; contradictory impulses (mourning destruction yet repairing) act in scene, with final loneliness as earned cost. Minor abstract summary in generational reflection slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cosmic imagery builds from transit to climax insertion, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure—"unexpected loneliness... silent eternity"—with undeniable emotional cost in final image. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden's debris and mist constrain sonar navigation and transit choices; recurring plasma "petals" evolve causally and charge final "serene shadows" image. Sensory bias (sonar shapes over vision) reflects Xylos's priorities perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (light without fire) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through perilous debris deepening opposition; agency in gear-insertion forecloses destructive pattern at cost of purpose's obsolescence, legible in loneliness beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repairing generational fire-pattern emerges organically via gear vs. ancestors' burning; final image non-literally reweights success as isolating serenity, lingering with ambiguity of obsolete mourning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct cosmic-sentimental perceptual signature (names for stars, friction-weeping) with rhythmic modulation from mournful hum to vibrating resonance; stable third-limited POV, no leakage, compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring transit's blur; purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle. Minor paraphrase loop in "silence deepened... pressing against eardrums" echoes prior stillness without advancing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal gear as parental heart powering cold math-light transforms clockwork-universe trope; sentimental repair risks bold cosmic scale, inevitable in hindsight via lineage pattern.</comment>
