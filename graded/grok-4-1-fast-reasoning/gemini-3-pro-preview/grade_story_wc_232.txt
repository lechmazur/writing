<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Empirically intuitive trait drives pivotal ant-following choice under flood pressure, earning final realization and step; contradictory grief-skepticism impulses act in scene without therapy-speak. Backstory anchors concretely to present promise, tilting stance. Minor slip: one reflective block slightly exceeds 20% but interleaves with micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: flood rise → ant path → chip insertion → portal CR with legible cost in "sealing the map of his grief forever." Single scene, orientation anchored by para 1. No ambiguity or breaks; persistent flood constraint shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent orchids, silt-petals, quartz veins constrain choices (ridge vs flood) and charge portal image; POV-filtered (map-dealer's geometry in ants). Sensory hierarchy narrows to ozone draft, stone vibration under crisis. Evolving details mirror internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach doorway vs flood) signaled para 1, tightens causally via ants/chip as water hits chest/chin; agency in intuition forecloses retreat with sanity/reputation cost paid earlier. Escalation forces realization/renunciation, cost felt in final step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief's crossroads emerges via promise reinterpretation, reweighting premise in final shop glimpse → face fracture; resonant CR without moralizing. Particulars (ants as path, chip query) shift meaning organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (empirical synthesis of air/scent/vibration); diction/rhythm modulates from descriptive to compressed under flood stress. No elision or head-hopping; prose reflects map-dealer's precise, intuitive mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "water lapping at his chest, he pressed the brass matrix"); varied rhythm accelerates to closure without loops/artifacts. Zero scaffold, clean propulsion through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: matrix 'Q' unlocks decisions doorway via ants' fractures in map-dealer's intuition; transforms time-trek trope into grief-sealing CR. Bold cavern solstice risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
