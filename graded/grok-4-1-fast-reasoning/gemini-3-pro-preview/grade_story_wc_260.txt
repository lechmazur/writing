<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (rage vs. compassion) act simultaneously in the surgery beat, earning her final renunciation of cynicism with embodied cost in trembling hands and whispered acknowledgment. Interiority particular via handler expertise; minor therapy-speak slip ("sympathetic shedding within her own psyche") slightly abstracts peak realization without fully dramatizing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: surgery layers build density to Charged Poise closure in tail-wrapping image reweighting naivety loss as strength gained, cost legible in "lost her innocence... retained her purpose." Single scene oriented early; one tightening via incision deepens internal/external stakes without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moss, mist, starlight constrain surgery (mist cools brow, starlight seals wound) and charge final image where nebula glow bathes reconstructed self. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (handler notes scales/rustle); selective vividness mirrors emotional shifts without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save creature amid betrayal) signaled early, tightens via peeling reversal narrowing to endurance choice; cost visible in shorter tail and foreclosed rage path. Agency in micro-choices (scalpel incision) coheres under Accumulative lens; abstract self-respect slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Surgery particulars yield emergent theme of compassion as honed discipline, resonant in final image reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in color shifts/gestures implies complexity; near-overt line ("true compassion was not a weakness... discipline to be honed") borders echo but anchors closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited with perceptual signature (handler attunes to hiss/scales); rhythmic modulation peaks in hushed whisper amid surgery tension. Whisper carries subtextual goal (soothe shared hurt); no head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in surgery beats; "shedding layers" motif purposeful without loop. Minor overwriting in "galaxy of dust motes dancing" and "starlight seemed to gather" risks figurative muddle mid-pressure, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Surgery-as-psyche-shedding synthesizes handler world with betrayal stakes into fresh metaphorical arc; magical regeneration twist transforms trope organically. Risk in overt parallel pays off in charged tail-wrap closure without gimmick.</comment>
