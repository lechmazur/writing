<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in the stubborn vine mirroring her past terror, compelling the final scalloping choice with embodied cost; hairpin memory anchors reflection to micro-action without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from discordant rhythm to release sigh and deepened hush; CR closure lands cleanly in "contentment was not a destination... but a byproduct," with cost in her hurt's residue legible on the hairpin slide-back.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting (floating rock, mossy floor, bruised purple light) constrains climb and pod access, charging final image; recurring clouds/wool unspun ground the high-perch insight without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free vine amid her contentment search) tightens via climb-deepened knowledge of shared fear, forcing scallop renunciation of hesitation; cost unmistakable in gold pulse and her residue wash.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rebirth cycle reweights via vine-pod release mirroring her forgiveness, offering non-literal resonant answer in "freeing others... washed away the last residues"; ambiguity lingers in duty's byproduct without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual signature (sap-stained hands, vineyard hush) modulates rhythmically to peak compression in scalloping; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax mirroring insight arc—no loops, coherent metaphors (velvet hush to unspun wool); opening anchors stakes, final line recharges hairpin motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Soul-gestating vines above clouds synthesize rebirth fresh via tactile scalloping and hairpin transcendence; risk in reflective lyric heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
