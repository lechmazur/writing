<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in esoteric wall-dreaming belief intensifies via embodied empathy ("frequency of abandonment" tightens chest); detachment lie contradicted by trembling hands at hearth, earning final burden-keeping with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sonic/discovery density builds to CR closure in final click revealing "tragic nightmare"; cost legible in packing artifacts, reconfiguring options from surveyor to keeper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (moss muffling boots, vines' "rain and rot") selectively filter through acoustic POV, constraining entry and charging hearth excavation; recurring clicker as micro-setting shapes all choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping safe ruins esoterically) tightens accumulatively via diary confession to film glimpse, narrowing detachment with "crushing reality" cost that alters final echo tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Preservation-betrayal theme emerges from particulars (sealed vaults, hopeful faces), reweighted non-literally in merged acoustic/history map; final image answers wall-dreams question with resonant conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature via sonic bias ("echo told him... heaviness"); rhythmic syntax modulates from detached mapping to somber realization, stable third-limited without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense propulsion weaves action/sensory ("pried them open... ink bled by time"); varied rhythm, no loops, coherent metaphors (walls "scream in... silence") heighten closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh acoustic cartography/esoteric empathy transforms post-apoc trope; film negative reprise from ash feels inevitable, risking bold conceptual stakes in wall-dreams premise.</comment>
