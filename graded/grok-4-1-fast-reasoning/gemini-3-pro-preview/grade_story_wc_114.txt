<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (suppress truth vs. reveal via margins) act simultaneously in the smudging beat, earning the final renunciation of solitude with embodied cost in "hollow ache" and closing eyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to smudging DC/RR, with cost legible in "diffuse fog that covered the world" and final isolation image reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station scanners and quartz windows constrain the analog hack; botanical illustration as micro-setting charges closure when smudged under aurora.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (diffuse catastrophe without panic) tightens accumulatively via smudge agency, foreclosing direct input with cost of prophetic isolation in final para.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of marginal subversion emerges organically; final "margins of the apocalypse" image offers resonant reweighting of fault-tolerance's burden without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with bio-digital perceptual signature ("ghosts in the optic nerve"); rhythmic modulation peaks in smudging's deliberate compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("jagged algorithm," "swaying certainties") propels without loops; peak smudging beat clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of analog hack on digital oracle transforms climate sci-fi trope; risk in lyric subtlety heightens closure's charged poise.</comment>
