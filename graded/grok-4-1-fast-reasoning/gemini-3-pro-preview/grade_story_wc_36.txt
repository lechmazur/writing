<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses culminate in the earned insight—"He had tried to dam a flood with a flute song"—with tears and scar of wisdom as visible cost, rooting the relic keeper's drive in past failure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ritual density to on-page CR closure: realization reweights flute's purpose with conceptual cost too late for reputation, anchored early in gorge descent; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood array and Canyon hush constrain ritual choice, charging vision warp; sensory hierarchy (auditory silence vs. piercing notes) mirrors internal shift from oppressive weight to mournful peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harvest insight escalates via accumulative deepening in flute vision—nausea jolt narrows past error into guidance realization—with agency in choosing new tune and felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of blocking vs. integrating emerges organically from ritual failure to canal metaphor, with final image of reweighted flute pack offering non-literal resonant answer that recharges prior collapse without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in acoustic bias ("acoustically violent gorge"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "notes spiraled upward," no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors like "avalanchingly quiet"; minor silence reiteration builds textural hush without loops, clear at closure image of charred driftwood.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sonic weaving premise transforms relic trope through grounded ritual physics and hindsight-inevitable canal insight; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
