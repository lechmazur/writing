<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as corn maze architect's child roots her barrier expertise, driving intuitive analysis and final resolve to rebuild walls. Interiority concrete via grain-tracing and knot-sensing, embodying fear of boundless "now." Minor abstractness in epiphany ("sacredness was... biological alarm") slightly undercuts embodiment at revelation peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: realizations density-build from terrace observation to grain intuition to logbook CR, reweighting boundaries stake. Orientation anchored early (Elara on prism terrace post-butterfly effect). Closure as CR lands cleanly: stepping back creates "first intentional gap," conceptual cost legible in sanctuary foundation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism terrace constrains via "chaotic winds of probability that threatened to blow her out of existence," forcing featherly advance. Desk grain as micro-setting enables analysis, charges logbook discovery. Atmosphere's "fractured hush" and refracted shards evolve with perception, mirroring internal clarification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate boundary-loss moment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via grain analysis deepening to logbook revelation narrowing options to "rebuild the walls." Agency in slipping cracks and intuiting forces conceptual trade-off. Cost felt in "suffocating 'now'" vs. imposed space, charging final step-back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges organically from maze backstory, butterfly collapse, logbook breach, to CR step-back reweighting "here/there" vs. "everywhere." Final image resonates non-literally: small retreat as "foundation of a new sanctuary," inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, perceptual signature via grain-swirls and cellulose memory. Rhythm modulates: featherly slips build to "heavy thud" thud. Purposeful compression (e.g., "slipped between its cracks") legible, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short declarative advances amid lyrical swells), high density in grain-tracing lines doing sensory/character/propulsion work. Minor metaphor density risks overwrite ("jagged shards of quiet," "terminal velocity") without closure harm. No loops; propulsion peaks at logbook "thud resonating."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-butterfly void + maze heritage + wood-grain time-map + METAR anomaly transforms chaos trope into boundaries CR. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes via irreplaceable desk/logbook pivot.</comment>
