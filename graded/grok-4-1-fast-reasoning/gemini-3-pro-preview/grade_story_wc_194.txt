<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied fatigue ("arm burned with lactic fire"), compelling the intuitive crank to closure; micro-choices like syncing breath reveal values. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously weaken 9+ eligibility; interiority concrete but leans external.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: crank insertion → intuitive rhythm → standing waves → shatter/revelation as DC with legible cost (physical strain, empire rupture). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene tightens meaningfully without slips touching closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Curved mahogany walls constrain waves and charge climax; golden shadows recur, vibrating to mirror pressure. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under urgency (hum in bones over sight). Micro-setting (gramophone) as pivotal tool elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven adjustments under causal lens, narrowing to resonance-or-fail; arm burn as visible cost alters endurance. One tightening sufficient; stakes viscerally felt in viscous air.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fragility of power emerges organically from crank-as-key and coarse laugh reweighting divine lie; final amplification offers resonant CR without moralizing. Particulars like wheezing voice avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (precise sonic embodiment); rhythmic control modulates from solemn pause to "sharp crack." No elision or head-hopping; diction fits solemn defier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "oscillations travel up his arm and into his marrow"); varied rhythm passes ear test, metaphors coherent ("metal ribcage"). Minor density dip in musing but no loops or artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gramophone/reality containment fresh synthesis, crank's rhythmic delicacy transforming brute trope; risk in sonic physics pays off inevitably at shatter, heightening ingenuity.</comment>
