<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sil-as's internal conflict peaks impeccably in the final feigned perplexity, with contradictory impulses—truth vs. denial—acting simultaneously as he traces the tablecloth voids, earning stasis through self-deception rooted in ambition flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via ritual density building to CR closure: cards' indictment reweights quest, with denial's cost legible in "pretending the answer was still hidden," no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Midnight glade's "choking beauty" and frost-kissed turf constrain vulnerability, charging final image where sky's judgment mirrors neglect; porcelain saucer crack as micro-setting anchors causal ink seepage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim time) tightens accumulatively via visions of neglect narrowing to denial, forcing trade-off with felt permanence; card spiral beat deepens pressure without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-inflicted loss emerges organically via tablecloth voids and card narrative, resonating in final non-literal image of traced emptiness reweighting repentance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (ink absorbing moonlight, prophetic skin) modulates rhythm under ritual stress; no head-hopping, diction biased toward cosmic isolation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor overwriting in opening "choking beauty" stack and synonym echoes ("empty spaces") dull two mid-ritual sentences without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy ritual for paternal regret transforms trope via onyx ink and cloud judgment, with denial turn inevitable from priors; bold celestial premise commits fully.</comment>
