<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia perfectly roots tactile coin discovery and sky-painting choices, with contradictory visual limits vs. embodied fingertip tracing compelling the climax; final endurance (closing eyes) earned by prior frustration. Internal conflict acts in scene via bypassed sight for touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plateau → coin fractals → successful swirls → rumble CR reconfigures infinity's fragility with conceptual cost in "perfection... bound to the fragility of its medium." Single tightening via coin suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bark ceiling and ladder constrain climbing/crafting choices; dust shaking from "illusionary clouds" charges final image. Tactile bark panel and fractal grooves filter through prosopagnosic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sky illusion before demolition) signaled early; fractal deepening via agency (tracing coin) narrows visual limits under Textural lens, with rumble foreclosing immortality—cost legible in sitting/closing eyes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of human limits vs. infinity emerges from plateau, fractal bridge, and fragile success; final "opened the sky beneath the earth" non-literally reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with prosopagnosic perceptual signature (faces as "topography"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "pendulum of pure geometry," heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure; minor overwriting in opening "vacuum of sound" slightly dulls initial propulsion but leaves climax clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind tactility, fractal coin in tree library, and transient sky transforms tropes; demolition risk heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
