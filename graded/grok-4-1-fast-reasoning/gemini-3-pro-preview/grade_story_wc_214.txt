<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—feeling "small and unseen" yet pursuing ritual empathy—act in the meteor scene, earning her final reconfiguration with visible cost in renewed spirit. Interiority particular via embodied warmth in chest post-climax. No unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to meteor ignition, cadence shifts at "disintegrating into a fine mist," landing CR closure where meteor's transformation reweights Elara's premise with conceptual cost of vulnerability-as-radiance. Orientation anchored early in outpost/janitor role; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass as micro-setting constrains ritual choice (filtering galaxy, pressed to eye) and charges final image ("placed it gently back into her pocket, feeling the residual warmth"). Sensory selection POV-biased toward reverence; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empathize for strength) signaled early, escalates via lens density to meteor's "fiery end," forcing stance crystallization in synchronized tracing; cost legible in imagined "surrender." Agency in ritual forecloses defeat path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("willingness to burn... only way to truly be seen") offers resonant CR to theme of transformation, reweighting smallness without moralizing; emerges organically from ritual particulars, inviting ambiguity in fragility's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (reverent lyricism: "sacred intersection of existence and oblivion"); rhythmic control heightens meteor pressure, modulating from hush to flare without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm, with figures ("silent scream of brilliance") coherent in climax; minor fig stack in meteor beat (-0.2) but no loops/muddle obscuring closure image. Propulsion aligns with accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms space-janitor trope via yellow glass ritual and CR on vulnerability, synthesizing lyric sci-fi with inevitable hindsight payoff; bold voice risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
