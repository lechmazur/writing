<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in terminal deadline compels renovation choices with embodied decline as cost. Brazen calm shows as trait through systematic actions amid lung ache. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak wiring beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: diagnosis therefore wiring therefore symbiosis. Closure as Charged Poise in final pulse-matching-heart image with legible life cost. Orientation anchored early in temple orchard ascent; time compression tightens without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: piezoelectric hum, ozone spark, warm bark/stone constrain wiring and charge final pulse image. POV-filtered details like root-pillar war evolve causally with action. No white-room; micro-setting of pillars/oaks pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve war pre-death) signaled early, tightens via body failure against orchard success under causal lens. Agency in wiring forecloses destruction path with life cost legible in fading heart. One decisive reversal reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies partnership emerges organically from wiring synthesis, resonating in final stone-heart pulse without moralizing. Final image reconfigures mineral/organic premise with conceptual harmony cost. Complexity lingers in death-as-completion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in geological/botanical bias; diction/rhythm modulates from deliberate calm to humming resonance. No head-hopping; compression of months taught early via diary/stiffness. Voice distinct, prose as character in systematic phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies with scene (ragged breath to pulsing teeth). Zero figurative muddle; specific verbs/nouns propel to closure image. Read-aloud ear clean, no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh piezoelectric symbiosis premise transforms man-nature trope via copper-bridge specifics; risk in geological sentience heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from wired particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
