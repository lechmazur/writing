<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in three-year wait compels high-stakes micro-choices like using the quill amid chaos; interiority concrete via embodied calm ("liquid grace") and inventive pressure. Minor slip in told "calmly inventive" demeanor without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but actions align and earn success. Final resumption of post reveals hierarchy of values with risk cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout therefore garden move, quill insertion therefore Cradle thrum, sundial rotation therefore feed-looping cameras—decisive change embeds revolution with felt exposure risk. Orientation anchors Elara/fort/gate by para 1; single scene coherent. Closure DC on "frequency had changed" line reconfigures options with conceptual cost of undetected shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sundial's photoreactive "ghost veins" and gnomon grooves constrain pivotal choice, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (thrum vs. harsh buzz) reflects Elara's priorities. Atmosphere tensions oppressive gold to "winking hush," mirroring liberation. Spatial choreography tracks pocket-to-dial cleanly; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early, tightens via quill-gnomon lock narrowing detection risk; agency in rotation forces trade-off of exposure. Escalation causal: blackout opportunity yields Cradle activation with legible cost in "under the noses" scramble. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at post-resumption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of decoupling oppression emerges via power shift (searing grid to "natural variance" hum), reweighted in final "lantern of secrets" image without moralizing. Subtext in sundial's archaic vs. modern failure invites ambiguity on liberation's fragility. Resonance from particulars like quill rifling, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: Elara's inventive bias filters "chaos not as a crisis, but...design." Voice texture modulates from purple-gloom tension to humming variance rhythm; no dialogue. Diction controlled, perceptual selectivity character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "bronze quill holder...etched with scrollwork" advances plot/character/world). Rhythm varies (short thrum sentences heighten climax); no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("sheets of oppressive gold," "ghost veins") but coherent, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: quill rifling on sundial gnomon activates wind/tide Cradle, transforming regime trope via tactile archaic code. Risk-taking in silent intrigue under blackout heightens stakes organically. Fresh angle inevitable in hindsight from half-painted reveal.</comment>
