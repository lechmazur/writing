<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to map grief is embodied through projecting presence into the void, with micro-choices like moving closer revealing values under pressure. Countess's change from twisting thread to melancholy acceptance feels earned via sensory details like the snapping thread. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("geography of healing") borders therapy-speak but anchors in action without flattening contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from harbor silence to garden shadows, culminating in Charged Poise closure where Countess's tension releases upon reading the page, with legible cost of deepened solitude. Orientation anchors early (hilltop estate, veranda). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Autumn garden (burning leaves, skeletal shadows) mirrors internal vacancy and constrains via encroaching chill/winter stranding, charging final image of inhaling house. Sensory hierarchy (crimson thread on pale skin, dry snap) filters through narrator's perceptual bias. Micro-setting (thread, page) tethers closure without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping her grief via obituary) signaled early, tightens texturally through projection/speaking/writing to acceptance, foreclosing denial with felt cost (melancholy solitude). One deepening (handing wet-ink page) narrows options under lens. Agency in intimate moves drives reconfiguration without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vacancy's shape emerges via thread/void/leaves, reweighted in final relic-holding without moralizing. Subtext in silences (dust motes, wind shift) invites ambiguity on healing's cost. Ending image answers premise non-literally, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (lonesome splendor, emotional density) biases details character-specifically, with rhythmic modulation (short snap sentence amid lyric flow). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("He is not simply gone"). Stable distance, no leakage; diction fits introspective traveler.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/emotion (e.g., "thread snapped... disproportionately loud") without loops or scaffolds. Varied rhythm supports propulsion, figurative coherent (amber memory, atmospheric pressure). Minor density dip in reflective blocks (-0.3), but no closure muddle or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise (obituaries for living) transforms grief via cartography metaphor, with risk-taking in textural lyricism heightening closure without gimmick. Thread/ship synthesis feels inevitable, particular details (wet ink, circulation-slowing twist) memorable and organic.</comment>
