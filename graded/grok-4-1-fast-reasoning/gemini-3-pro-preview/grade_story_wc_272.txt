<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's analytical loops and contradictory impulses toward light vs. dark are embodied in his questioning and final descent, earning the choice to paint in void. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "maddening analytical loop that had ruined his art" slightly abstracts under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from glitching ocean to walls closing, culminating in CR closure: "He dropped through the floor... began to paint," reweighting reality with cost of lost world above. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse library; one tightening via chute realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting (light beams as ropes, bleeding shelves) constrains redesign choice and charges final abyss image. Sensory hierarchy (throbbing bones, neon sorrow) reflects artist POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive crush) escalates accumulatively as walls near shoulders, forcing agency in untangling; visible cost in squeezed breath and slammed walls. Protagonist-driven deepening narrows to descent trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of soulful art vs. geometric failure emerges organically from failed portraits to dark canvas realization, with final image non-literally answering "dark the only canvas clean enough." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in enlightenment trap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractured light as threads, palette of grief); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to compressed under stress. Voice texture biased toward artistic seeing sustains closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors like "horizon shatter like a dropped mirror" integrate action. Minor overwriting in climax figurative density ("luminescent ache," "neon sorrow") slightly risks coherence without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of glitching reality redesign via artist untangling threads transforms tropes; bold descent risk heightens stakes, with tarot box coffin image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
