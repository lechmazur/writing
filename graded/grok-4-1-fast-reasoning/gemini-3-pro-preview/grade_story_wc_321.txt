<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in professional pride and positivity compels radio action under spectral pressure, with embodied cheer ("infectious cheer") defying chill; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for deeper interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scrubbing to radioing synthesizes sand via frequency, yielding DC closure as grotto dissolves with lurching cost ("deck lurched violently"); orientation anchors early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spectral grotto and sideways clocks constrain choices (rhythm with starlight guides dials), hourglass charges final image as sand flows; sensory details (whispering water, static hiss) integrate purposefully through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timeline merge) signaled early, tightens via radio filling hourglass, forcing trade-off in violent re-entry; agency in dialing and cheering drives escalation under causal lens with legible kinetic cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilient refusal of stasis emerges from positivity merging timelines, resonant in sand manifestation and final sunlight without moralizing; final image reconfigures transient poise into earned return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (professional pride in scrubbing, uniform smoothing); rhythmic prose modulates from stasis to motion, dialogue natural and goal-driven ("Station Control, this is the Silver Tern").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm ("hands did not tick forward but slid horizontally"); minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("beautiful, terrifying stasis") during setup, but no loops or artifacts dull climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral ferry limbo and sonic timeline merge feels inevitable via hourglass payoff; transforms ghost ship trope through deckhand agency and pattern-taught physics.</comment>
