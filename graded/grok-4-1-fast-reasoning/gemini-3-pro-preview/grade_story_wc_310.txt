<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions (brightness in eyes, doubt in chest) and micro-choices via coin casts reveal hierarchy of chance over logic; endurance earned despite stellar doubt. Minor slip in over-articulated motivation line ("to wavelength align with purpose") feels slightly diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from static to prophecy to charged poise of persistence; closure lands on-page in "gathered the coins... until the final light went out" with felt cost of potential cosmic end. Orientation anchored early; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber deck and resin floor constrain via sinking boots and lost coin, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (noise, cold metal) filtered through POV urgency mirrors internal chaos. Exceptional integration elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving history tightens via coin-guided signal to prophecy, deepening with doubt; one decisive density increase reweights options under Accumulative lens. Internal pressure lacks external test, limiting peak agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of chance-justified persistence emerges organically from coin rituals and prophecy archive, resonant in final reconfiguration of doubt vs. endurance without moralizing. Closing image reweights cosmic cycle premise effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (static as data, coins as navigation); rhythmic modulation heightens dissonance to poise. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory action; purposeful poetic compression fits voice. Minor "heavy" repetition (coat, gold, suffocating) creates subtle synonym churn without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of post-contraction decay, coin-lots causality, and backwards history transforms cosmic tropes; risk-taking in lyric endurance heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight via persistent constraints.</comment>
