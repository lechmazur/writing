<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied dread (teeth ache, trembling fingers) roots motivation; contradictory retreat/march-back impulses act in scene, earning final carving resolve with lineage cost, though realizations verge diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as realizations densify to CR closure ("He would carve the face of the fear... to close the loop") with legible conceptual cost (lineage unzips if wrong); orientation anchors early, shards transition cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard's spectral hum and light overload constrains retreat/inquiry choices and charges final shadows/orchard reprise; sensory hierarchy (C-sharp unnerving teeth) mirrors panic purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (carve right face to secure loop) signaled early, escalates texturally via overload-retreat-realization tightening options; agency in shout and grip forecloses inaction with felt unzipping risk at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Paradox theme emerges organically from shell/orchard particulars, final fear-carving image reweights inheritance non-literally with loop-cost resonance; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "phantom weight."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cosmic-perceptual signature ("punchline of a cosmic joke," "weeping light"); rhythmic diction modulates overload to charged poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; purposeful "brightened disquiet" motif elevates without muddle, though minor metaphor density slightly thickens peak epiphanies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pistachio-shell time-loop on humming asteroid transforms inheritance trope via grounded dread-carving synthesis; risk-taking in nonlinear CR feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
