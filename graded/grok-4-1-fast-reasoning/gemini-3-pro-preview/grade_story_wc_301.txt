<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation, with unmedicated clarity driving embodied micro-choices like transcribing graffiti; final weeping earns change through prior avoidance, fulfilling 9+ test via contradictory impulses (methodical desperation) acting in the accordion-playing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with density tightening from graffiti interpretation to river coordinate; on-page Charged Poise closure ("raw solace... settling deep in his bones") delivers legible emotional cost in the weeping image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ivy crush, damp plaster, mud sink) filter through chronicler's bias and constrain choices (scrambling bank); final muddy bank image charges closure, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant guilt/forgiveness stake signaled early, with textural escalation via graffiti-to-river deepening narrowing to the "exact intersection of longitude and regret"; agency in playing forecloses avoidance with felt cost in purifying silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of river as non-judging archive emerges organically from particulars like "The water always takes what is owed"; final image offers resonant non-literal answer (weeping catalogs swirls for soul salvation), reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (graffiti as "transient prophets"); rhythmic diction modulates to peak compression in "wheezed... crinkling like an old lung," fulfilling 9+ test with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, with varied rhythm (short gasps in playing beat mirroring stakes); purposeful metaphors like "leaking air through silver duct tape" integrate without muddle, passing 9+ test; zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of graffiti oracles and taped accordion apology transforms guilt trope into fresh chronicler quest; risk of solo interpretive pilgrimage heightens stakes organically, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
