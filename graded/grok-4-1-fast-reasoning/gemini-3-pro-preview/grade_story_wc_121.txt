<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions (pull of fragments vs. tablet focus) culminating in earned landing choice; final exhale and thud reveal hierarchy of values with visceral cost. No stock phrasing; flaws (eternal loops) drive struggle without hedging. Hairline: brief whisper diagnostic but immediately embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build (visions intensify) to Resonant Reconfiguration closure; tablet-guided left turn snaps path, syncing drop-ripple for legible before/after with thud's cost. Orientation anchored in first para; no disorientation debt. Single scene fits defaults flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Viaduct, mist, and drop constrain choices (hover, turn creates walkway) and charge final ripple-image; sensory hierarchy (static charge, white lightning) narrows under crisis via POV bias. "Darkening brightness" mirrors internal fusion without overt symbolism. Body as micro-setting (boots thud) elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wholeness vs. scatter) signaled early, escalates via density (fractured Elaras) under Accumulative lens, tightening at tablet crumble forcing gravity acceptance with bone-vibrating cost. Agency in rune-trust and exhale forecloses buoyancy path. One decisive deepening suffices perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of singularity vs. fragmentation emerges organically from visions and fusion; final "crushing, beautiful burden" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of loops foreclosed. No moralizing; ambiguity (eternal doom) lingers meaningfully. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (algorithmic randomization as lived chaos); diction/rhythm modulate intensity ("time stretched elastically") without leakage. Voice surreal yet biased (ignores variants for runes). Experimental compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied rhythms accelerate to thud); metaphors purposeful ("stone flower," "blooming") without muddle in peak. No loops/artifacts; "darkening brightness" pattern-taught integrates flawlessly. Minor: occasional dense figuration in visions but supports texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural worlds and self-labyrinth transforms surreal tropes; risk in elastic time/drop-sync heightens stakes organically. Premise implications (memory-built bridge) followed boldly to realness cost. Inevitable hindsight from early cues like hovering symptom.</comment>
