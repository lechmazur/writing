<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's acoustic sensitivity as curse-blessing drives embodied micro-choices like the gentle bow rasp over strike, earning her endurance in unresolved play; minimal shown internal contradiction slightly limits peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure where final note reconfigures silence as "canvas waiting," with legible cost in unresolved drift and survivors' tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken dome and shipwrecks constrain acoustics, turning orchard into "great, transparent cello" that amplifies climax and charges final hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unbinding hush escalates via violin finding dome's frequency, driven by Elara's agency; cost felt in tears and foreclosed resolution, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges implicitly through raw melody and unresolved note, reweighting hush in final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with hearing-biased perceptual signature ("distinguishing groan from sigh"); rhythmic modulation heightens music climax without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in fire-crackle to violin; minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("fragile lung," "metal wreath") slightly dulls early propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh post-collapse ritual transforms silence trope via acoustic dome resonance and unresolved stasis; risks lyric ending payoff effectively.</comment>
