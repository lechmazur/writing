<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in "furiously tranquil" act simultaneously, enabling steady hands under storm pressure; final awe earned via map's scars validating memory with emotional cost. Interiority concrete and poet-specific, no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from timer vigil to solvent pour and buzz, culminating in CR closure—"profound, storm-kissed wonder" reweights censorship premise with undeniable conceptual cost of real scars. Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via reaction complete suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and glass floor constrain choices (steady hands amid battering) and charge final image (lightning illuminates scars on map/sky). Sensory hierarchy reflects poet's bias; details tactile, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal map's truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timer to buzz and dissolving ink narrowing revelation window; agency in timed pour forecloses failure with felt cost of reopened wounds in "fresh wounds reopening."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed truth vs. censorship emerges organically from ink dissolution and storm; final image offers resonant CR—"storm and poet had washed it clean"—reweighting prior suppression without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (metaphors fusing censorship/storm); syntax/rhythm modulate tension to awe, prose as poet's mind under stress. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, metaphors coherent (ink as censor's hand pays off); minor figurative density in opening build risks overwrite but pattern-taught and closure-sharp. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dulling reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chemical map-reveal in storm observatory transforms censorship trope via poet's sensory reclamation; fresh synthesis of darkroom process and scars cartography feels inevitable, risk-taking heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
