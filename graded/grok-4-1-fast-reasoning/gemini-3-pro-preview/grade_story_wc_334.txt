<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in past barter intensifies to compel pressing the mushroom despite terror, with embodied trembling fingers and heart hammering revealing contradictory fear/exhilaration. Interiority concrete and particular to folklorist lens; flaws like chronic curiosity earned prior cost without safety-hedging. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts emotional progression but anchors present stakes without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shadows sliding to beam piercing, culminating in on-page Resonant Reconfiguration as memory restores with legible cost in "worth every second of the cold, dark wait." Orientation anchored early in dome/orchard/shipwrecks; single scene causality tight with one meaningful tightening via wreck alignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken orchard and shipwreck silhouettes constrain ritual choice via precise Pleiades-pattern need, charging final image as hulls dissolve into starlit canopy. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (folklorist sees broken constellations, smells crisp nostalgia); purposeful selection mirrors urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early tightens via agency-driven detection/rush/press under Accumulative lens, narrowing options with isolation cost felt throughout. Escalation coheres in alignment reversal forcing climax trade-off; cost unmistakable in decades' solitude foreclosed by restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity's price emerges organically from theft/recovery arc, reweighted in final image where past slots perfectly without moralizing. Nostalgia motif shifts from hallucination to roar, charging CR with conceptual cost of bartered life. Complexity lingers in unambiguous triumph earned through loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (constellations in wrecks, ritual geometry) and rhythmic modulation building to climax compression. Prose texture distinct in sensory diction/syntax reflecting folklorist mind under stress; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to climax; figurative layering ("crown of thorns," "fractured map") purposeful and pattern-taught without muddle. Minor repetition of "crisp nostalgia" creates echo but no loops; overwrites contained outside peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklorist ritual in shipwreck-domed orchard transforms fairy trope via specific alignments and memory theft; risk-taking in underwater astronomy heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
