<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through calculated risks like checking rebreather; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values in leap onto unstable steps. Limited contradictory impulses shown in scene, but final claim earned by prior preservation oath. Internal conflict more implied than dramatized simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: flake peels mural therefore reveals stairs, shaking ground escalates to unstable projection narrowing options. Orientation anchored early via monocle and waterfall. Closure DC lands on-page with cost legible in "just as the first rays... piercing," foreclosing incineration path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "oil-slick rainbows" and "chrome and fiber optics" trees constrain ascent and charge final throne overlook. Mural as micro-setting guides choice via hard-light stairs. POV bias filters through Elara's lore focus, evolving causally with peel and flicker.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim throne pre-sunrise) signaled early, tightens via flickering stairs forcing leap with time cost. Agency in sallying onto ephemeral steps; pressure coheres causally without coincidence resolution. One meaningful reversal narrows options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of bridging past lore to future survival emerges via murals' "techno-utopia" shifting to resolve in throne sync. Final image reconfigures nostalgia non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like painted figures watching ascent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "neon hues... wet ferrocrete"; diction modulates rhythm under stress, compressing in climb. Voice distinct, poetic texture purposeful for sci-fi lyricism. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "sliced the ruby flake downward, the gray... curled away"; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in peel metaphors doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolds dulling key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: paint-peeling via ruby flake births hard-light stairs from mural, transforming utopia trope into causal ascent. Risky leap into "painting" heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from flake's code-memory logic.</comment>
