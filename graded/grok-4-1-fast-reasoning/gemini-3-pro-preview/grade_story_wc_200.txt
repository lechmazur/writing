<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elian's modestly fearless trait compels calm micro-choices under spectral pressure, earning the ghost's release through insight; minimal contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene but prior causality supports final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: harp dissonance draws ghost (inciting), tooth confronts lie (climax tightening), laughter triggers DC release with luminous ache cost legible in final image; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist, echoes, damp stone constrain harp method and charge closure (darkness lifts to peaceful silence); sensory details (regrets smell, cold air) filter through Elian's priorities, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect Thorne) signaled early, causal escalation narrows via roar resistance then tooth agency foreclosing brooding path; cost (poignant sadness) unmistakable in fading motes and Elian's satisfaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of laughter healing solemnity emerges implicitly from tooth farce to spectral laugh, reweighting Thorne's dignity in final image without moralizing; resonant reconfiguration avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (calm amid chaos); prose rhythm modulates from dissonant pluck to luminous close, no head-hopping; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel causal beats without loops or scaffolds; metaphors (mist boiling, chains shattering) coherent and purposeful, zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic ghost-hunting and comedic relic transforms tropes; crocodile tooth farce turn inevitable from harp setup, bold laughter premise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
