<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's yearning for "texture of connection" roots motivation in embodied "hollow ache," driving the mid-strike halt and lens improvisation as earned micro-choices under Kael's disappointment pressure. Internal conflict between routine performance and deeper need acts simultaneously until realization. Minor lack of visible flaws complicating the peak choice prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine ritual accumulates to pattern break via Elara's realization—"questioning assumptions"—leading to lens use and Charged Poise closure in Kael's gasp and her "tingling" fingers as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in lab post-Stabilization. Single scene causality tight, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lab's "glass canisters" and "clerestory windows" filter through Elara's priorities, supplying workbench lens that constrains and enables climax choice; "golden shadows solidify" charges final image. Sensory balance vivid, purposeful, POV-biased. Micro-setting (lens, bells) indispensable to turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging souls via vibration—tightens accumulatively from failed "indigo and violet" ritual to lens-propelled "powerfully gentle" impact, narrowing options with Elara's agency. Cost legible in Kael's "tears" and her "tingling." Entry to 8.8 via live trade-off, but no moral calculus sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sensory connection emerges organically from failed visuals to tactile "heavy blanket" payoff, reweighting premise in final "solidify around them" image without moralizing. Subtext in Kael's "pilgrimage failing" invites ambiguity on analog loss. Resonant non-literal answer to yearning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable on Elara, perceptual signature in harmonic-to-spectral bias; minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Stay still"). Prose rhythm modulates to short, punchy climax sentences. No head-hopping, diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in climax ("focused beam... tangible force"); minor overwriting in explanatory "The focused beam served to propel" dulls propulsion slightly. No loops, artifacts, or scaffold; read-aloud ear strong. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism-song bells translating to touch via carbide lens synthesizes fresh sci-fi sensory physics, transforming pilgrimage trope through Elara's hack; "texture she sought" feels inevitable from setup. Risky premise fully committed, no hedging.</comment>
