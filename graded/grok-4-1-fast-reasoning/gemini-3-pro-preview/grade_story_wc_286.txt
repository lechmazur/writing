<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's zen mindset drives micro-choices like softening touch to mirror land's memory, embodied in vibration traveling spine to hands; interiority particular without stock phrasing. Earned change honors oasis without fixing wasteland, foreclosing aggressive repair path with conceptual cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from clay centering to thrum intensification and timeline visions, culminating in CR closure ("To resist change... act of devotion") with legible conceptual cost of fragile preservation. One tightening via glass connection narrows understanding. Orientation anchored early in potter-oasis setup; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skeletal hives, damp clay, lantern glass constrain choices (sun patterns dictate rim, glass carves groove) and charge final image (raw vessel as artifact). Sensory hierarchy (thrum as physical heartbeat) reflects zen priorities; evolves causally with twilight pressure. Recurring glass/oasis mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance) signaled early, deepens via bee thrum and keeper gaze forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Agency in infusing gentleness forecloses "fixing" with felt cost of honoring limits. One tightening via vibration harmony suffices; minor abstractness in stakes legibility prevents 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of devotion-preservation emerges organically from clay process and timeline layers, reweighted in final pot-image without moralizing. Returning glass/mica shifts meaning, linking kindness to endurance. Resonant non-literal answer in "bandaged with love... scar that refused to fade."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with zen perceptual signature (noticing sun patterns, thrum as heartbeat). Rhythmic modulation matches wheel whir to thrum intensification; purposeful compression in visionary beats taught early. No elision or head-hopping; diction controlled and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "thrum... collective heartbeat of a million ghostly bees" advances atmosphere/plot); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (mica sheets, phototropic) without muddle in peak thrum beat. Minor overwriting in layered timeline description nudges below 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pottery ritual and temporal oasis, transforming wasteland trope via phototropic kindness rule grown from particulars. Bold risk in fractured timelines pays off in pot-artifact closure; inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
