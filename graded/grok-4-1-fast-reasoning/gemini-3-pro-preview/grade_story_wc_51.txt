<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Singular motivation intensifies compellingly to higher-stakes alignment choice; interiority concrete and embodied in "boundary-lessly trapped" spiral threat. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously as concentration frays yet persists under mind-loss risk. Final endurance earned with felt ongoing burden cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recursive spiral narrowing options to mind-loss threat, pattern breaks decisively in calcification DC. Orientation anchored early in cavern/forest setup. Closure on-page with legible cost in exhaled mist and archived stones.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and starlight fissure constrain precise alignment choice; recurring damp chill and shingled hush sharpen sensory hierarchy under crisis. Micro-setting (fissure beam) charges final image. Details POV-filtered through weaver's geometric reverie.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize volatile regret) signaled early, tightens via endless regression forcing precise agency. Escalation coheres accumulatively to foreclose mind-entrapment path with visible exertion cost. Climax trade-off unmistakable in shuddering air and snapped twigs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of burden-transfer emerges organically from fractal weave to calcified archive; final satchel image offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration of emotional weight. Complexity in her willing endurance avoids tidy moral. Particulars like porous stones recharge premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in oceanic/geometric diction; rhythm modulates from heavy reverie to sharp climax snap. Elevated syntax reflects weaver's mind without register drift. No head-hopping or withheld facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies purposefully, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density purposeful and pattern-taught in whalebone/oceanic motif without muddle in peak "twigs snapping" beat. Minor overwriting in opening eased by action integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh fractal emotion-weaving premise transformed via brass burner physics; burner reprise heightens ingenuity. Risky reverie tone commits fully, inevitable in hindsight. Non-obvious synthesis of geometry/grief elevates beyond tropes.</comment>
