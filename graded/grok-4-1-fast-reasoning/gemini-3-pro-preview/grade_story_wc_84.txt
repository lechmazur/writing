<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots compellingly in phantom soul-pain, intensifying to the trembling pull; micro-choice reveals values hierarchy with Pilgrim's slump as cost. Interiority concrete and pilot-specific, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beat beyond hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: star-trail nav → arrival → chip yank → signal decode as DC with legible cost ("metallic snap" deactivates Pilgrim). Orientation anchors early; single scene tightens meaningfully without slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory debris constrains climb/pull; thinning air/star trails shape pilot tactics. "Brilliant dimness" recurs to charge final flare of understanding, filtering through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) tightens via Pilgrim/chip discovery, narrowing to pull with agency; cost unmistakable in slump and "tight, calcified" resistance under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of noise-to-meaning emerges organically via chip/filter; final "locked tight by ancient font" reconfigures identity voids without moralizing, reweighting premise through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with pilot perceptual bias (haptic dance, star overlays); rhythmic texture modulates tension, diction controlled without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; opening metaphors ("bruising purple") purposeful but verge on overwrite without harming pull/closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of drone-star nav, font-chip signal decode transforms tropes; "sentence with vowels removed" inflects freshly, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
