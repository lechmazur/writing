<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between calculated rebellion and father's gut-risk act in scene via graffiti-tracing and equation-proofing; final peace earned by mortality revelation at podium with embodied acceptance over fear. Interiority particular (stent vibration, no-tremble finger). Backstory anchors present choices without drag.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of contradictions builds to CR closure in book-truth and unwetting rain image, reweighting premise with mortality cost legible in "profound sense of peace." Orientation anchored early (subway, post-heart Elena). One tightening: library arrival narrows to personal revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mica lantern constrains navigation and charges final contradictions (rain vanishes on armchairs, dry books); library labyrinth and floor equations force goal-directed path to podium. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (math-etched floors, clover scent). Final rain image mirrors internal peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (agency via hidden order post-heart) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to book-truth tightening that forecloses fear-option with peace-cost. Agency in interpreting scrawls and lantern-use narrows to acceptance. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of logic-magic fusion emerges implicitly from particulars (scrawls-equations, stabilizing text); final image non-literally answers rebellion-question via "logic and magic... same grand formula," reweighting without moral. Resonance from green-gloom peace amid mortality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: probability lens filters contradictions (vectors, deviations, variables). Lyrical rhythm modulates from screech to hush, stable close-third POV. Patterned elision of contradictions taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels (multi-job lines integrate sense/action); varied rhythm passes ear-test, no loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors build lucid contradictions without muddle. Peak closure vivid: "rain continued to fall without wetting her skin."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: math-graffiti portals to paradox-library, transformed by professor's post-heart calculus vs. father's chance. Mica pane uniquely reveals core concept; risk-taking in seamless magical transition heightens stakes organically.</comment>
