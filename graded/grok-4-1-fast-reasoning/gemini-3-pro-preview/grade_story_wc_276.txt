<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of cool-headed fisher through contradictory impulses: breathes to smooth air despite predatory hum, anchors logic against feral lullaby clawing mind. Final catch earned by micro-choices like zigzag and voiced void, with visible mental cost. No safety-hedging; flaws like ignored stars heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bass blooms to constellation collision shattering patterns, yielding on-page Decisive Change (spike pins echo). Orientation anchored early ("thigh-deep in... Sound Wave Garden"); cost legible in "lullaby still clawed softly at... mind." Persistent iron constraint shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (zigzag evades defenses; emotions transliterate to thorns/mud) and charges final prism image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (fisher ignores stars for quarry); details tactile, integrated ("vibrating against her waders"). No white-room; evolves causally with star disruption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch goddess echo) signaled early, escalates via density increase to pattern break narrowing options for strike. Agency in voiced silence and spike swing forecloses path with felt cost ("lullaby... clawed softly"); one decisive tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of capturing divine fragment amid chaos emerges organically: refusal of sleepwalking stars' song reweights hunt's cost in final "throbbing pulse... ready to be sold," non-literal answer to divine abandonment. Resonance from particulars like iron anchoring ethereal; ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: fisher's selective notice (quarry over stars) biases diction toward logic amid chaos ("cold logic of the hunt"). Rhythmic control modulates intensity (short sentences in strike); purposeful compression legible, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels: sentences multi-task (e.g., "rail spike struck... pinning... to the vibrating earth" advances action/sets image). Minor overwrite from figurative density in climax ("scream of silence collided") borders muddle but pattern-taught and closure-sharp; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fishing and cosmic somnambulism feels inevitable: echo as "silver trout" transforms trope via transliteration rules, risk-taking in voiced void heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity commits to premise fully.</comment>
