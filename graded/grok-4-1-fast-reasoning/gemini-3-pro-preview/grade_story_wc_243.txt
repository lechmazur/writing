<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines in "joy so intense it felt like a ghost passing through her ribs," embodying grief and duty; motivation to preserve small moments drives micro-choices like diverting seawater. Final shift to guardian earned by ritual causality, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak steep moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to infusion swirl, cadence shifts at success with RR (Charged Poise in anchored laughter). Orientation anchored early ("wooden planks...orchids"); cost legible in "no longer merely a widow," reconfiguring her role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains ritual via tide timing and wood depression, charging final image of pollen-scented preservation; sensory hierarchy (salt/pollen, glowing flora) reflects archivist's priorities. Micro-setting (loose stone, puddle) guides choices without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate covenant) signaled early, tightens via precise twilight interval and trembling steep; agency in proximate nudges forecloses failure path. Under Accumulative lens, density reweights with felt cost in skin-prickle presence, but no strong reversal narrows options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love/memory cycling via ink-tide emerges organically from ritual particulars, final image ("heart beating...lapping waves") offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Subtext in flowers sighing layers emotional resonance tied to closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (walnut-stained hands, ear for emotional vibration); rhythmic prose modulates from melancholic to vibrant. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at "atmosphere shift...terrifying presence."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("swirl, dark and briny, mirroring the chaotic sky"); no loops, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("violet sky bruised...ghost passing") slightly muddles peak infusion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink-archivist magic via proximate causes transforms grief trope; risk in indirect ritual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at anchored joy. No derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
