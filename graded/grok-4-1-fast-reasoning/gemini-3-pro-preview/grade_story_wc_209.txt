<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority and embodied emotion culminate in earned realization with tears and brush pickup; motivation rooted in haunting question drives micro-choices like apparatus construction. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+; confrontation of vanity flaw feels diagnostic in final reckoning line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup to CR closure via flower's unfurling and Elara's tears/reckoning; on-page cost legible in "tears that had formed in her eyes" reconfiguring her art view. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in Amber Pavilion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Amber panes and cathedral glass fragment constrain viewing choice and charge revelation; sensory details (frost recede, bio-luminescent pulse) filtered through artistic POV evolve causally with moonrise. Final painting moment integrates setting's golden light with shadow hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand night bloom) tightens via three-night wait to revelation, narrowing to conceptual cost of vanity art; agency in alignment and viewing forecloses prior worldview. Accumulative deepening suffices, but lacks sharper live option foreclosure for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden beauty for void emerges organically from flower's "lighthouse" signal and Elara's indigo brush dip reweighting her murals; resonant CR without moralizing. Final image non-literally answers bloom question via survival/generosity shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (spectral autumn, umbral tenderness) stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic control modulates from anticipation to hush without head-hopping. Prose texture reflects artist's shadowed soul consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "sigh that seemed to ripple") propels via varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrites in descriptive density slightly blur peak reveal but pattern-taught and closure clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cathedral glass imperfections revealing UV veins transforms night-bloom trope into lighthouse signal; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from postcards to shadow painting.</question>
