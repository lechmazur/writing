<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's steadily curious trait compels the climactic breach of protocol with embodied cost ("pulse hammer against his ribs"), earning the confide through prior mapping impulses; client passivity slightly dilutes relational crucible but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as card placements and measurements densify to pattern break (geometry wrong, anomaly verified), delivering on-page CR closure ("witness to a crime scene") with legible conceptual cost in the final burden and tape image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring tape constrains choices across measurements and charges final image ("small yellow warning that the dimensions... constrained"); ink stains and loft details integrate tactilely without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curiosity vs. professional distance) deepens via anomaly under accumulative lens, forcing agency in confide with on-page cost (breach, burden); pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of engineered loss emerges organically from geometric mapping to CR revelation ("deliberate pruning"), reweighting premise in tape's final resonance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in grandfather's legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (ink "to the bone," fractal shapes); rhythmic control heightens under stress ("sharp, violent snap"); dialogue natural, subtext-driven ("I practice reverse engineering").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "onyx ink swirling into... shattered bridges"); no loops or artifacts, varied rhythm survives read-aloud even in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-crash cartomancy with geometric reverse-engineering transforms tropes; tape's evolution from tool to detonator symbol risks bold ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
