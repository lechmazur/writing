<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in heartbeat counting as tether and shard as grief coordinate, rooting motivation in consistent survivor traits; final absorption of lesson earns change with embodied cost in "bitter pill of wisdom."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via ritual beats—static clears, ink spills, projection resolves—building to CR closure where "realizing that the failure had not been the fight itself, but the silence" reconfigures life with legible emotional cost; orientation anchors early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensor table and ink constrain digital bridge choice; snow-smothered dome and thin air charge isolation, mirroring internal ghosts in final "quiet chill of the snowy peak"; selective sensory weave fits POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to extract wisdom escalates accumulatively through ink patterns tightening to revelation, narrowing from anticipation to sorrow's cost; agency in chaotic fluid ritual drives deepening without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from relational silence emerges organically via projection's confession reweighting argument; final heartbeat resume offers resonant non-literal answer, charging prior grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with perceptual signature in iridescent/tactile noticing; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, prose as character in "tallied the rhythmic thumping" reflecting haunted precision; elision of wife's full backup taught early, pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like ink "pooled and ran in unpredictable rivulets across the sensors"; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, clean syntax supports closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ink-on-shard bypasses digital logic via analog chaos in fresh, inevitable synthesis of bureaucratic ghost summoning marital ghost; risk-taking in ritual transforms tropes, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
