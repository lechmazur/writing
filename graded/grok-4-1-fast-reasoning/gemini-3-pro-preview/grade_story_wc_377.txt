<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness creates embodied constraint felt in hand-on-frame climax, forcing vibration reliance that reveals hierarchy of values; motivation intensifies through desperate singularity, earning endurance with conceptual cost to self in final resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as melt-driven vibrations cascade to valley impact; CR closure lands in "engineered a shout" with legible cost of ice's brevity and world's disruption, oriented early via bluff and post-Quieting frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Iceberg facets and brass frame constrain melt initiation and sound dive, charging final "collisions of forces" image; sensory hierarchy (prismatic sting to bone vibration) reflects tuner's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early tightens via melt's weight-shift reversal, narrowing to brief chaotic rhythm under textural lens; agency in hoisting forecloses equilibrium with felt sacrifice cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Raw physics vs. consensus reweights through iceberg's "mathematical inevitability," offering non-literal CR answer in final shout image without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in enduring vs. ephemeral impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical texture with perceptual bias (imagined indigo bursts) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from precise actions to charged poise, diction purposeful without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in peak melt ("swung low... dove off"); no loops, metaphors cohere (focusing lens quirk), propulsion peaks clean in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mute tuner engineering ice-melt sound in post-verbal world synthesizes fresh physics-of-truth premise; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via tuned sculpture payoff.</comment>
