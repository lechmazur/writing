<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive nature shown in "face as still as the cooling magma... even while his heart wept," embodying contradiction without labels; final shift to catastrophe earned by failed attempts. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "intimately acquainted with the chemistry of failure" slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: successive failures build density to "penny drops" realization (CR closure) with cost in "cold biting his exposed skin"; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember Nexus constrains via deepening cold ("frost creeping up his boots") and charges final image as creature melts frost; sensory hierarchy alchemical (molten gold "screams").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify via destruction) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through two failed iterations narrowing to reagent addition; agency in abandoning order, cost legible in risked stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges via crozier's transformation, final creature spiraling as non-literal answer reweighting preservation; ambiguity in "beautiful, icy stasis" lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in alchemical metaphors ("weeping and buckle," "violent, chromatic instability"); rhythmic control modulates from poised observation to chaotic birth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy failures vs. flowing realization); minor overwriting in "frozen bloom of arrested smoke" mixes vehicles but doesn't obscure climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical creative destruction via crozier transmutes stasis trope; risk in lyric escalation from ordered attempts to anarchic birth feels inevitable.</comment>
