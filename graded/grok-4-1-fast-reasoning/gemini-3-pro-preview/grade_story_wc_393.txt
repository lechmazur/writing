<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's guilt embodied in hesitant step and gut-stone, motivation intensifies via inmate's dying question compelling mechanical quest. Contradictory impulses (spiritual forgiveness vs. tangible fix) act in seeking second opinion. Final renunciation of prior failure earned with cost in paralysis, no safety-hedging. Minor abstract phrasing in epiphany ("grace he had withheld") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds via revelation (resonance engine), pattern of stopped time to beating heart. Orientation anchored early (shop threshold, bundle). CR closure in final image ("vibrant accusation in the hush") reweights premise with undeniable guilt cost, legible in "paralyzed by the grace." Lens holds cleanly, constraint (hidden key) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shop as "cathedral of stopped time" vivid, selective (golden gloom, dust motes); light pull charges heart reveal and final image. Sensory hierarchy: Elias notices mechanical scars via guilt bias. Window/drapes constrain view, mirroring internal clarity shift. Micro-object (music box) integrates as resonant trigger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix heart for redemption) signaled early, tightens via "resonance engine" deepening that changes knowledge/options. Agency in Elias's confession forces woman's response; pressure coheres accumulatively to CR. Cost felt in "shroud" realization foreclosing spiritual failure path. No 9+ as escalation leans revelatory over agency-driven turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (resonance over rote fixing) emerges via heart's beat syncing music, non-literal answer in "needed to be heard." Subtext in woman's question ("Do we get what we deserve?") layers ambiguity without moralizing. Final image reweights prior chaplain/inmate dynamic with conceptual cost of withheld listening. No thematic echo or sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias, perceptual signature in mechanical reverences ("Eucharist" bundle). Dialogue subtextual (woman's murmur probes guilt), distinct idioms (Elias cracking, her soft). Rhythm modulates: short clicks build to thrum. Minor filter ("Elias watched, breathless") but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short clicks amid lush similes). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; "vibrant hush" purposeful frame. Minor overwriting in opening ("suspended energy of a thousand silent springs") but integrates without dulling peak (heart shudder). Clean mechanics propel to charged close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Core premise (resonance heart as listening metaphor) fresh synthesis of mechanical redemption trope. Risk in CR via "never powered by a spring" reweights forgiveness rule-set inevitably. Bold image (beating accusation) heightens stakes; no derivatives, transforms chaplain archetype via guilt paralysis.</comment>
