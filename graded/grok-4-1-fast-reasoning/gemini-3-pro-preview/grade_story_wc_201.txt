<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied trauma responses reveal contradictory impulses acting in real-time, like muscles locking before sitting; final reconfiguration from victim to forest component earned via somatic map. Interiority concrete and particular, no stock epiphanies. Minor diagnostic edge in mercy realization doesn't undercut peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of proprioceptive details builds to clearing singularity; CR closure lands with cost in "symphony of agony" endured, reweighting victimhood. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via mask removal narrows to exposure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>UV forest and body-as-micro-setting constrain choices (phantom flinches over roots, radiation searing lungs); final image charged by proprioceptive link to "roots of the trees and bedrock." Sensory hierarchy vivid, selective (teeth ache, ozone), filtered through enhanced nerves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve mercy equation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening somatic guidance to mask removal and endurance; agency in standing still forecloses escape with legible cost in "crushing weight." One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mercy theme emerges organically from pain calculus, culminating in resonant CR: "mercy was not the absence of pain, but the perfect, symmetrical distribution." No moralizing; final image reweights premise without literal statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in somatic noticing ("shins ached before a drop-off"); rhythmic control modulates from jagged clarity to geometric silence. Close third stable, lyric compression taught early and legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm (short gasps amid dense metaphors); no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in radiation beats borders overwriting but coheres via pattern, not muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive curse, UV penance, pain mathematics feels inevitable; bold lyric risk in trauma-as-navigation transforms tropes without gimmickry, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
