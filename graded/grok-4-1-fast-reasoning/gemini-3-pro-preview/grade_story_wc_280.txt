<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Barnaby's synesthetic interiority and stage-ghost motivation drive concrete micro-choices like humming B-flat and pulling 1924 laughter, with contradictory impulses (direct aid impossible) yielding earned success. Clara's observed shift feels character-particular via legacy tie. Final resolve forecloses bankruptcy path with felt spectral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density merges fractured timeline shards into healed spring, tightening from violet streaks/grey static to golden Star overlay. Orientation anchored early (gates clanging, orchard). Closure as Charged Poise RR with Barnaby's velvet surge as legible cost, persistent hedge/echo constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hedge maze/orchard constrains echoes bouncing off walls and glitching trees melting frost, charging final healed hum. Synesthetic sensory hierarchy (silence as ash, laughter solidifying) filters via Barnaby's bias, evolving causally with merger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert Clara's ruin via timeline fix) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through echo density/crescendo narrowing despair options. Barnaby's agency in conducting sounds forces trade-off (ectoplasmic scratch vs. success), cost visible in feverish will and fragile smile payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-rebirth emerges organically from coin-shift and nostalgia wash, final wind-roar reweighting ruin into reinvention without moral. Particulars like peanut/perfume glow avoid platitudes, inviting ambiguity in ghostly triumph's transience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature shines in synesthetic diction (despair's smoke, spiced wine surge), rhythmic control modulating from bitter ash to spun sugar crescendo. Purposeful compression of timeline glitches legible under Accum lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "violet streaks... dissonant grey static" advances plot/atmosphere), varied rhythm supports propulsion. Synesthetic metaphors cohere without muddle, though dense figurative layering in merger beat borders overwriting (-0.3). No loops/scaffold; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost-echo merger transforms trope timeline into fresh stage-conducting triumph, inevitable hindsight from early encore craving. Bold spectral limits heighten stakes organically, no hedging.</comment>
