<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots deeply in pacifist empathy, shown through micro-choices like discarding the "too melancholy" fork for oscillator tuning, compelling the climax without force. Contradictory impulses act in scene: protection vs. release of sorrow, embodied in his whispers blending with hum. Final cataloging as 'Exhale of Forgiven Regret' earns change with felt cost of inviting rot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sound attempts building resonance; orientation anchors Elias's sanctum and festival by para 2. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with clasp's sigh and catalog note, cost legible in "sorrow rots if not allowed to breathe." No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ozone-sharp clasp, dust motes vibrating) filter through Elias's priorities, with workshop tools constraining choices. Recurring oscillator/book charge final image under open stars. Fireworks evolution mirrors internal release, evolving causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empathic unlocking) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed fork to successful lullaby thrum narrowing to success. Agency in tuning realization (protection, not anger) forces trade-off, cost visible in clasp's tremble and invitation. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at open diary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy over conquest emerges organically from tuning negotiation, reweighted in final "asked it to dance" without statement. Silences motif accumulates via catalog to charged exhale image. Complexity lingers in sorrow's rot, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: synesthetic descriptions like "smell of ozone" or "taste of swallowed word." Voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose texture distinct and biased to frequencies/silences. Murmurs feel goal-driven, theatrical without on-page dialogue excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short critiques amid long hum descriptions), no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (chrysanthemum bloom). Propulsion peaks at "clasp sighed," clarity intact. Final line recharges motifs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms lockpicking via sonic empathy, pacifist cataloging of silences; fireworks inflect integrates riskily with workshop poise. Core premise (frequency diplomacy) feels inevitable, tropes subverted organically without hedging.</comment>
