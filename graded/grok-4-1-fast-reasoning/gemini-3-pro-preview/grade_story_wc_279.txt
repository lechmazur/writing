<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation to discover meaning drives micro-choices like sand mandala creation; thumb sweep reveals values with embodied cost in ruined art. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to auditory deadlock, mandala severance as RR (Charged Poise) creates emergent hush with legible cost in "muddy brown" ruined art image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics amplify chaos, constraining chalk-to-sand shift; lilac mist retreat charges final clarity image, fulfilling 9+ constraint test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dissonance fever pitch deepens stake under Accumulative lens, forcing agency in interjection that forecloses intact mandala with on-page muddy cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ruined mandala offers resonant answer to unmaking—visual silence births hush—reweighting chaos-to-order premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: social cues in voices, pattern-noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure; minor figurative density in setup ("suffocating quilt") without peak muddle, but slight scaffold in voice descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sand mandala moderating ghosts via visual silence transforms acoustic chaos premise organically; bold synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
