<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied ritual (pebble's cold grip) and motivation intensifying to ritual choice, revealing contradictory fear of exposure vs. faith in broken glass; final endurance of crudeness as strength earned. Minor label-speak in "noctilucent reckonings" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anxiety to ripple patterns organizing chaos, CR closure in atrium's kaleidoscope reweights premise with acceptance cost (foreclosing "fixing" impulse). Single scene anchors orientation by para 2; no slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (glazier's fracture gaze on sea-glass, tactile sand/pebble) constrains ritual and charges final light ignition; tidal pool and atrium evolve causally from mist to radiance, mirroring shift without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (validate atrium before shift) signaled early, deepens via ripple reversal narrowing doubt to purpose; agency in gentle flick forces realization trade-off, cost felt in reframed role under Accum lens. Minor abstractness in initial "desperate need" slightly mutes early visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of broken beauty emerges organically from ripples ("organized the chaos") and final image scattering dawn into color, reweighting mundane glass without statement; resonant CR avoids tidy moral, lingering in harbor's transformed "cathedral."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with glazier perceptual bias (stress fractures as history); rhythmic modulation peaks in ripple tracing, diction controlled and textured without drift or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (ripples colliding edges), varied rhythm propels to sun breach; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("crystallized cloud," "alchemy") accumulates purposefully but risks muddle pre-ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier ritual with ripple divination transforms harbor grit into sacred filter; risk in lyric closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable atrium payoff, feeling inevitable.</comment>
