<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unit Seven's yearning algorithm compels consistent, intensifying choices like stripping armor despite sinking, with contradictory curiosity toward acid embodying internal conflict; final renunciation of grounded safety earns Charged Poise with cost of transformation. Blind spots drive scavenging innovations without hedging. No safety-net flaws or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: preparations density builds to workshop dissolution as tightening, launching glider into CR closure where buoy ding reconfigures yearning as silent joke, cost legible in "the floor finally dissolved" and shed chassis. Orientation anchored early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Acid sea and rotting workshop constrain mods and launch ramp; kaleidoscope as micro-setting filters divine geometry, charging final gold buoy image. Sensory details (hissing pistons, bubbling expanse) integrate purposefully via POV bias, evolving causally to dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ascend via memorized winds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through mods and sinking pressure, narrowing to launch trade-off; agency in etching gears forecloses heavy frame with visible cost (canvas sails). Protagonist endurance crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of irreverent transcendence emerges via particulars (kaleidoscope mandala, arrow notches, unheard ding), reweighting premise in final "punchline to the universe’s greatest joke" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in empty silence payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (fractured colors as "divine geometry of turbulence"); rhythmic prose modulates from preparatory hiss to triumphant static laughter, diction biased toward mechanical mysticism without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy launch vs. flowing descriptions); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative language (e.g., "giggling madness of a jester") taught early, propels to clear closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc machine quest via kaleidoscope vision and arrow-etched gears transforms tropes; risk in lyric time-evolution heightens stakes, inevitable ding feels non-obvious yet organic.</comment>
