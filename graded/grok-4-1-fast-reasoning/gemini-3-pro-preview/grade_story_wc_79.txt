<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as spiral-shell cartographer is rooted in brother's loss and intensifies through mapping to whistle-blowing, with hesitation showing minor internal conflict. Interiority concrete via pattern-reading and embodied dread, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak reveal. Final realization earned with felt cost of entrapment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build to whistle trigger, response, fissure CR closure reweighting premise (organic to mechanical) with conceptual cost legible in "whistle, the key to a cage." Orientation anchored para 1; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (sun's flaying weight, steam's ancient smell) filtered through cartographer's shell-focus constrains mapping choice and charges fissure reveal. Shell as micro-setting evolves causally, mirroring realization without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode trajectory/question Watchers) signaled early, escalates via whistle agency to fissure deepening knowledge/cost under Accumulative lens. One tightening sufficient; live option (autonomy prayer) foreclosed by mechanical truth, felt in final grip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of deceptive nature/machine emerges organically from shell patterns to gears, final image resonant CR reweighting "offering" without moralizing. Particulars (whistle, spirals) shift meaning, inviting ambiguity on agency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with cartographer perceptual signature (fractal expansions, growth rings). Rhythmic prose modulates tension (short fissure sentences); no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; purposeful metaphors (sunwashed dread) taught early without muddle in peak fissure beat. Minor figurative density in opening but no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: biological patterns as mechanical schematics on turtle-machines transforms tropes, with risk-taking in CR reveal inevitable from setup. Bold premise (city-offering to operators) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
