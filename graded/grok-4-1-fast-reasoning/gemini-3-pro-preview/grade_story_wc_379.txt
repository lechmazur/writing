<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove listening heals is embodied in concrete micro-choices like guiding conversations and pressing her cheek to the iron; traits as curator of histories drive the curation of memories. Internal conflict subtle in calm amid chaos, with flaws balanced by competence. Minor telling in "terrifying composure" and epiphany phrasing slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory threads builds to tumbler thunks, culminating in Charged Poise RR via locket/note reconfiguring panic to solidarity with felt cost of ignored frenzy. Single scene oriented by ~50 words (courtyard, dawn, demolition); no shards or ambiguity. Closure cost legible in "quietest method...loudest victory."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (purple wisteria lanterns, grinding gears, cold iron cheek) filters through Elara's perceptual priorities, constraining choices via pillar proximity and dust-shaking roar. Courtyard micro-setting charges final image: locket glinting like shield amid closed ranks. No white-room; evolves causally with roar escalation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save sanctuary via deed) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as stories layer onto mechanism amid roar; her agency in listening/story curation forecloses panic path with cost in neighbors' frenzy ignored. Escalation coherent under lens: density increase forces stance crystallization; crew arrival adds pressure without coincidence resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stories as ownership emerges organically from particulars (sun angle, cane taps, rhyme), resonant non-literal answer in note "belongs to those who keep its stories" reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence radiating from her; ambiguity in no deed lingers productively. Final image ties arc inextricable from listening heals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (subtle tracks, curation lens); voice texture in rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (frenzy vs. calm). No dialogue, so n/a; free indirect clean, diction POV-plausible for curator. Experimental tolerance unnecessary; consistency under stress intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance + image), varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("sandstorm calm—still and centered while chaos whipped," "cascading lanterns") during opener slightly muddles but spares closure; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift curator unlocks holographic will via collective memories transforms trope of lost deed/community save. Risk in quiet listening method vs. force pays off in hindsight inevitability; no template echoes, bold in non-violent victory through subtle tracks.</comment>
