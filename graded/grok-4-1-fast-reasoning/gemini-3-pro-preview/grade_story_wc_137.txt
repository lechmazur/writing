<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's shift from skeptic to protector is earned through embodied contradiction at "cognitive resonance was empirically undeniable," compelling higher-stakes choice with academic cost clearly felt in her resumed work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of data connections and memories builds to Resonant Reconfiguration closure in "Each number she copied locked a floating memory into place," with legible conceptual cost to her skepticism and town's legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower's stone floor and whale thrums constrain perception and charge final image, mirroring internal chaos-to-stillness; sensory details like "briny scent" and "thermal drop" filter through scientific POV without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archiving vs. preserving history deepens via pattern realization, forcing endurance with on-page academic risk; whale synchronization tightens pressure under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ordering sorrow emerges organically from magic square's logic applied to memories, answered non-literally in final whale procession image reweighting skepticism without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with scientific perceptual signature ("cataloging the thermal drop") modulates rhythmically under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action and image; minor figurative density in peak memory beats ("entangled memories... vast, unheard symphony") risks slight overwrite but supports Accumulative texture without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as grief anchor syncing whales/memories transforms tropes; risk of mystic-science bridge heightens stakes inevitably toward closure without gimmickry.</comment>
