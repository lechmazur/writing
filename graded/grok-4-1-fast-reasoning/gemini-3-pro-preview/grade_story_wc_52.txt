<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied ritual (thumbs into grain) reveal practical soul confronting grief; motivation to harvest lessons compels transfer with cost; minor diagnostic tone in "the beast does not hate" epiphany slightly undercuts immediacy but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to crystallized visualization, kettle shriek cadence shift delivers Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "safe and separate" wood containment; orientation anchored early in loft ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (rain applause, kettle hum to scream, wood grain) constrain timeframe and charge final tea image; skylight evolution mirrors internal shift from storm to peace; micro-setting (workbench, kettle) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain grief before boil) signaled early, deepens via warming wood and visualization under Accum lens; agency in transfer forecloses liquefaction path; whistle forces trade-off with felt cost in enduring peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transient "here and gone" vs. preservation emerges organically through ritual particulars; final sip reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of separation; ambiguity in practical magic invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature (clinical detachment in visualization) with rhythmic modulation; diction reflects practical bias; purposeful compression in crystallized state taught early, pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short shriek sentence snaps tension); no loops or scaffolds, figures like "cellulose lattice" purposeful without muddle; propulsion aligns with ritual build to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-ritual via crystallized time transforms widow trope; bold internal magic feels inevitable from practical traits; risk in abstract mechanics heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
