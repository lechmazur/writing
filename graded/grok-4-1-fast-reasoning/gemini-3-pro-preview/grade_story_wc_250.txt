<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's silent empathy and calm are embodied through precise actions like retrieving the mirror and weaving light, compelling his higher-stakes choice to aid without words. Woman's guilt shown via knuckle-white grip and breath release, with change earned via lantern display. Minor weakness in her underdeveloped contradictory impulses, but secondary role fits scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmospheric density builds via tension and lantern mechanics to CR closure in starburst on water ("geometric starburst, a silent explosion of clarity"), reweighting guilt with felt cost in her released breath. Orientation anchored early (dock, guardian, woman). Single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ozone, wet timber, groaning louvers) filter through Elias's priorities, constraining choices via lantern recesses and railing. Charges final image: light lattice on undulating water mirrors internal shift. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (woman's unspoken guilt) signaled early via hovering confession; tightening via Elias's weaving narrows to release under textural lens, with visible cost in foreclosed festering secret and her sharp breath. Pressure coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of light needing darkness emerges organically from weaving action and starburst image ("blackest canvas is necessary for the most profound illuminations"), offering resonant CR without statement. Complexity lingers in balanced night/illumination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (e.g., "vision could succeed" over words); rhythmic prose modulates tension to poise. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image integration (e.g., "tapestry of luminescence"); minor overwriting in figuration ("spiralingly calm") fits voice but borders drift. No loops; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: dental mirror repurposed for lantern weaves literal/metaphoric stars, transforming dock tropes via Elias's empathy. Risky lyric closure feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
