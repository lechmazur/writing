<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's interior contradiction peaks in frantic dial-turning against machinery's rebellion, earning his final slumped renunciation with embodied sinking heart; flaws like cold intellect drive inevitable loss to Kael's raw charisma. Minor telling of motivation ("arrogant as it was noble") doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as anomaly density builds to pattern break (static screams allegiance shift), landing CR closure in severed dial tone and lonely realization with undeniable emotional cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains as rattling barrier and charges final blue-lit shadows; clockwork birds mock futility tactilely, sensory hierarchy (thunder rhythm, thin air) filters via visionary POV, evolving with sympathetic storm resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal control for dawn-shaping) tightens accumulatively via allegiance anomaly narrowing options to futile levers; Silas's failed corrections force endurance with legible isolation cost in final abandonment hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hubris of choreographing dawn emerges organically from signal betrayal, final slumped image reweights premise (shadows choose better vessel) with resonant ambiguity of noble sparking without participation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (gears, binary songs as whimsy); rhythmic diction modulates from visionary confidence to melancholic close ("cosmic inevitability cannot be choreographed"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short frantic clauses amid lyrical swells); no loops/artifacts, rhythm breathes with pressure (discordant chirps mock), final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghostly radio consciousness synthesizing steampunk tropes into allegiance shift feels inevitable and risky; transforms mad-scientist archetype via signal agency, no derivative hedging.</comment>
