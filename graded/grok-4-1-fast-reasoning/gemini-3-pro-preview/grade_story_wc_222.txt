<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in "cautious abandon" on slippery parapet act simultaneously with reverent bow and grin, earning final laugh as earned renunciation of safety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages hold via sundial check → piece swaps → board shudder → sky roar; DC closure in "mechanism clicked" with cost in threatening wind, lens consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cracks under boots and wind tearing clothes constrain swaps and charge final stance; selective sensory hierarchy (ozone, violet light) mirrors POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to break stalemate tightens via successive swaps narrowing to final king placement; agency in substitutions drives causal escalation, cost legible in physical gale threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stasis vs chaos theme emerges via piece secrets ("safety is cousin of death"); final image of door swinging wide reweights premise non-literally with embrace cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias (absurdity in ritual); rhythmic prose modulates from cautious navigation to laughing gale, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density in swap beats ("wooden knight... rattled a parchment"); minor overwriting in "thunderclap trapped in a bottle" but no loops or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Chessboard stalemate amended by secret-scroll pieces offers fresh synthesis; risk in cosmic sabotage inevitable via causal build to chaotic payoff.</comment>
