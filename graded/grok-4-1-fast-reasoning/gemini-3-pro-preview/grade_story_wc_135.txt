<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reactively visionary trait roots clear motivation in archivist lens, shown concretely via "scattered data points of grief and hope" driving micro-choices like staggered blasts; contradictory solitude vs. action impulses act in scene with earned shift to unifier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from observation to sonic pattern break; on-page RR closure in "final note hanging... fragments had coalesced" reconfigures silence with felt cost of averted alienation, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Valve as micro-setting constrains slotting choice and charges final modulation; wet ivory stones and fog vibrate sound through boots, mirroring internal states via POV archivist bias without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging fracture escalates accumulatively through observation → run → adjust blasts on crowd posture, narrowing to cadence shift with legible cost in "permanent alienation" threat; protagonist agency drives heartening without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Navigated absences theme emerges organically from sonic weaving dissolving tension, reweighting fragments-to-whole without statement; final murmur image offers resonant non-literal answer to unification question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with archivist perceptual signature ("chemical memories," "data points") biases noticing; lyrical rhythm modulates from quiet observation to pulsing blasts, maintaining diction control under rising density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied syntax propels from "slick and luminous" opener to charged final image; purposeful metaphors like "heartbeat of a sleeper waking" integrate without muddle in peak blasts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh sonic unification of exiles via salvaged valve transforms returnee trope through archivist ingenuity; risk in staggered method heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
