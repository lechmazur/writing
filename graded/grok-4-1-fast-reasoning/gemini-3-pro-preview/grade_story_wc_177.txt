<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's temporal blindness creates contradictory impulses—visions guide but blind the present—forcing the earned lever pull; embodied stress in frantic digging reveals character. Minor label-speak on curse early slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to dream shard transition, pattern break at seal snap, Charged Poise/CR closure ("She pulled the lever, finally merging with the storm") with legible cost (bunker floods, safety rejected). Single scene/shard fits scope; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ozone, rotting leaf litter, wet concrete) constrain choices (mulch hides box) and charge final image; rewilded bunker evolves causally with storm. POV bias filters through Elara's ethereal perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcend blindness amid storm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via visions/dream tightening options to lever; agency forecloses safety path with on-page cost (embrace chaos).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rejecting decaying order for chaotic now emerges organically via particulars (rotting roots vs seal break); final merging image offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (ethereal, fractured time perception); rhythmic prose modulates tension, prose-as-character reflects fractured mind; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful figurative pattern (ethereal grit) taught early avoids muddle. Minor dense metaphors in opening ("crushing embrace of oak roots") border overwriting but integrate without obscuring climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hindsight-foresight curse, playful AI jester, fragile paper seal on apocalypse lever transforms tropes; risk of lyric decay motif heightens closure inevitability.</comment>
