<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian's intuitive expertise and motivation to teach silence comfort shine through actions like pouring the drop; Kael's embodied shift from gasping terror to whispered peace reveals character under pressure. Limited contradictory impulses reduce depth—no internal debate before acting. Final mediation earns her change with prior vigilance shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup to whistle's assault tightens, drop catalyzes RR closure (silence reconfigures from crushing to embracing) with legible cost in "psychic noise that could derail." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in gondola's ether. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism terrace constrains via sonic fragility ("shatter the structural integrity"), storm glass as micro-setting enables tactical drop rippling lattice. Final kaleidoscope charges closure image, mirroring peace. Sensory hierarchy (low hum, feral silence) POV-specific, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe transit via silence mediation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: whistle vibration narrows to suffocating quiet, Elian's drop agency forecloses derailment with felt micro-fracture cost. Coherent pressure under lens, one decisive tightening sufficient. Kael's terror adds visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of taming feral silence emerges organically via drop's "harmonic resonance" transforming void to blanket; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in Kael's "It feels... kind" implies earned resonance. No tidy binaries, ambiguity in void's wildness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature (Elian intuits vial's "liquid reasoning"); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to warm embrace under stress. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven. No head-hopping, diction biased to operator's sonic attunement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels: drop "expanded outward in a perfect circle, rippling through the crystal terrace" does image/action/closure work. Rhythms vary (short crisis sentences to breathing close); no loops, coherent metaphors (storm memory softens edge). Minor figurative density in climax taught/paid off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh ether gondola premise with sonic fragility and storm glass alchemy transforms tropes organically; risk in silence-as-physical-threat heightens stakes. Vial drop turn inevitable from Elian's duty, no derivative templates. Bold synthesis feels singular.</comment>
