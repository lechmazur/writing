<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via the "wild animal trapped in a cage of bone" heart sensation and "iridescent caution" mindset driving precise micro-choices like chalk-tracking and timed submersion; motivation intensifies organically to compel the high-stakes dip. Contradictory impulses in respecting the volatile beauty show in deliberate slowness amid hammering heart. Final realization earned by causal arc of surgery-to-experiment, foreclosing passive observation with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup (chalk lines, solvent prep) to climax submersion; on-page CR closure via "magnetism was not magic; it was geometry and attention" reconfigures premise with undeniable conceptual cost in refracting light insight. Orientation anchored early in tea house/veranda/fog; one tightening at light-beam creep narrows options perfectly for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating tea house and valley-mist constrain altitude/rotation for sun alignment, charging tactics; micro-setting via tatami chalk trails and crystal bowl integrates into action, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (muffled hush, swaying lanterns) reflects dye master's light-obsessed POV without catalog. Final mist-parting image recharges environment, constraining passive life.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill structural color or wing crumbles) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sun progress tightening timing; agency in "sharp exhale" submersion forecloses failure path with felt risk. Pressure coheres to CR, cyan pulse as visible cost altering options to triumph. One deepening sufficient, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of charisma as prismatic refraction emerges implicitly from wing experiment mirroring donor heart, reweighting premise in final image without statement. Subtext in "iridescent caution" shapes choices; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, lingering ambiguity in "willing to refract... rather than absorb."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in light/refractive bias ("physical manifestation of perspective"); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed prep to "quietly explosive" pulse. No dialogue; diction controlled, syntax reflects cautious precision under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cyan pressure pushed... lanterns sway" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "iron filings to a magnet" cohere without muddle. Propulsion peaks cleanly at submersion without overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye science, donor-heart transplant, and structural color as charisma metaphor transforms tropes organically; risk in impossible feat pays off in geometric insight, feeling inevitable from setup. Bold altitude/rotation premise heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
