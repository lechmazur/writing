<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's opening paralysis ("hands hovered uselessly") embodies uncertainty, compelling higher-stakes ritual choice underwater; contradictory fear and desperation act simultaneously, earning resolute closure realization with lung-burn cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density and golden light reconfiguration tighten to CR closure ("gold was not metal, but the resilience of the soul"); orientation anchored early in workshop breach; cost legible in final exhale and sinking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid sea and gears constrain ritual (breach forces submersion, statue as tool pulses back decay); underwater sensory narrowing (caustic fluid stinging) charges final impervious relic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjure meaning) signaled early, deepens via breath-tightened narration turning corrosion into chisel stroke; agency in impossible charm fit forecloses erasure with death cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges from ritual particulars (molten gold in pockmarks glorifying damage), reweighting ruin in final relic image without moralizing; resonance from accepting destroyer into creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (alchemical bias: gears as "golden clockwork"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in submersion, lyric compression taught early and legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency (short sentences in lung-burn peak); figurative density purposeful for lyric mode with closure payoff, minor mixed vehicles ("quilt of remembrance" vs. "final chisel stroke") slightly muddle without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychic narration quilting memories into acid-proof relic transforms alchemical trope; risk of underwater mind-projection heights closure without gimmick.</comment>
