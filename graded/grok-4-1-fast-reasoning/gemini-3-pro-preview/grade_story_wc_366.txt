<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's reticence and warm observance drive concrete micro-choices like noticing the unstable stack and adding sea glass, earning Thomas's recovery with emotional cost. Internal conflict is embodied in deliberate slowness amid pressing shadows, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Strong individual traits via actions; minor slip in epiphany depth keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lamp-out blindness to shadows pressing, tightening via unstable stack to sea glass glow as RR (Charged Poise), reconfiguring atmosphere with felt relief cost in Thomas's shudder. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse arrival. Closure cost legible in "luminescent ache" defying storm; persistent constraint of stones shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room's glass trap and heavy shadows constrain Thomas's crumbling, mirroring internal erosion; sea glass on sill charges final glow image. Sensory hierarchy (tremor in hands, wind howl) reflects Elias's observant bias, integrated into action. Recurrent stack guides choice, evolving with glow payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect fragile mind post-lamp-out) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via unstable stack observation to sea glass intervention, narrowing from distress to endurance with agency and legible cost in shattered atmosphere. One decisive deepening suffices; Thomas's posture loosening forecloses terror path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silent endurance via stone lexicon emerges organically from stack's distress signal to "declaration of endurance" glow, reweighting isolation without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to safety-in-solitude question. Minor drift in backstory-like stack explanation slightly abstracts emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with Elias's perceptual signature: cataloging "human erosion" and pebble shifts. Prose texture modulates rhythmically from deliberate slowness to blooming glow under pressure. Minimal dialogue ("I can't fix it") natural, subtext-laden; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (shadows "eager to reclaim," "condensed warmth") taught early for haunted buildup, paying off cleanly at glow without muddle. Varied rhythm propels; minor overwriting in opening metaphors (-0.3) but no loops or closure artifacts. "Luminescent ache" line anchors propulsion.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stone cairns as "anonymous letter chain" transforms haunted lighthouse trope into silent survival vernacular, with sea glass glow as non-obvious endurance pivot. Risky lyric prose heightens isolation stakes organically. No derivative echoes; closure feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
