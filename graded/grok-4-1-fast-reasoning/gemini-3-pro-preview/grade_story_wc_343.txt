<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives consistent micro-choices like aligning the book and tracing the hopscotch, revealing character through professional intensity. Interiority feels embodied in "sociable isolation" and heart-racing thrill, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the discovery beat. Trait "diligently curious" is shown via forensic examination rather than label-only.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns in birds, floor grid, book alignment build density to sphere's manifestation (DC/CR) with felt cost in its dissolution and her dusted knees. Orientation anchors early via airship and Elara's role. Single tightening via grid reveal suffices; closure reconfigures her charting success on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "copper hull groaning," "cedar and old memories," and strobing shadows integrate into action, with ship history constraining her hunt. Nursery floor as micro-setting charges climax by enabling grid discovery. Hopscotch board mirrors internal priorities, evolving with vibration and sphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (charting luminance) signaled early tightens via pattern accumulation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to sphere's brief appearance with agency in her noting. Escalation peaks in hum and materialization, forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in dissolving light and powder-dusted knees. Quiet endurance of isolation reconfigured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of discovery in mundane geometry emerges organically via patterns and final charting image, reweighting isolation into cosmic connection without moralizing. Subtext in birds' reaction and dissolving sphere offers resonant ambiguity on trapped wonders. Final walk to deck answers premise non-literally with thrill's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias toward navigational geometry; lyrical diction like "violet bruise" and "trapped star" modulates rhythmically with intensity. No head-hopping; perceptual signature in pattern-noticing feels character-specific. Voice distinct, eliding dialogue aptly for solo introspection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in viscous air and pulsing light. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("living smoke") doesn't obscure closure; no loops or scaffolds dull momentum. Precise verbs and specifics propel without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hopscotch as navigational grid and book-fold hypotenuse synthesize fresh premise organically, transforming tropes via airship lore. Final dissolution reweights ingenuity with cost, risking quiet closure that heightens meaning. Non-obvious patterns feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
