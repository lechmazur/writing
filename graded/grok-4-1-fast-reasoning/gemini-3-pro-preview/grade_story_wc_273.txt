<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's serene anger embodies contradictory impulses (loathing drone yet deploying it) and compels the final shift to tracking patterns, earned via prior causality; Kaelen's knowing smile applies sharp pressure. Minor stock phrasing like "predator’s silent grace" slightly genericizes but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links (drone tracks to confrontation, ink spills to escape); closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "He would track the pattern now, not the man" with felt cost of failure (icy knot, tears). Orientation anchors early; one tightening via escape reconfigures options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>UV on pale skin and wind howling constrain choices (goggles adjusted, voice carries over gale) and charge final image (blinding sky streams tears); sensory hierarchy reflects Silas's priorities (grating hum, suspended motes). Specificity vivid and POV-filtered without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover logs for time dilation mastery) tightens via Kaelen's ink escape, narrowing options with agency-driven lunge; cost legible in failure and new pursuit. Escalation coherent under causal lens, though ink method introduces slight coincidence that complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of crisis as "exit from time" emerges organically from ink mandala and logs, reweighted in final realization without statement; resonant via particulars like fractal vortex. Invites ambiguity (geometry rewrites reality) with emotional aftereffect in icy knot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (time drags internally amid external rush); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You cannot outrun the light" vs. "exit from it"). Rhythm modulates under pressure; diction purposeful without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, figurative language purposeful (dust motes as stars). Minor density in opening descriptions (e.g., "serene anger" motif borders repetition) but doesn't obscure peak escape clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation hunt, fractal ink portal, and albino UV vulnerability transforms tropes organically; bold risk in quiet CR closure ("drone landing... like a tame bird") heightens stakes inevitably from priors.</comment>
