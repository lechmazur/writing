<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory "furiously tranquil" impulses drive vortex-taming micro-choices; final pea-holding endurance earns repricing via tactile "granular vibration" cost, rooted in custodian traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to flattened vortex; CR closure in "sand slipping upward" reconfigures entropy premise with undeniable conceptual cost of stolen time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound atrium and acorn cap constrain entropy act, narrowing to light-catching aperture; starry glass roof charges pea image, evolving with causal frost sublimation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake deepens from seed access to borrowed-time texture via agency in acorn visualization; Accumulative cadence shift flattens vortex, imposing gritty "friction that shouldn't exist" price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reversal motif ("dust to remember stone") emerges organically, reweighted in vault's humming walls without moral; final pea offers non-literal answer to chaos inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in geometric/order bias; rhythmic control peaks in "glacier sighing in reverse," modulating intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density fuses action-image in "acorn cap toward distortion"; varied syntax propels, zero loops, metaphors cohere without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Acorn as chaos inverse synthesizes cryogenic sci-fi into entropy poetics; bold Accumulative lyricism transforms vortex trope, inevitable in hindsight via willful order.</comment>
