<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through character-particular analogical thinking, with contradictory terror and tenderness toward the seed compelling the planting choice. Final realization of Aris's re-contextualization feels earned by prior linguistic metaphors bridging grief and action. Blind spot in fearing the seed's "silent weight" drives struggle without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as meditative density builds to sprout emergence as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring separation with conceptual cost in "forever just beyond the reach of his physical hand." Orientation anchors swiftly in Magnetic Arbor post-Aris's death. One tightening via activation stabilizes drift without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic soil and iron-willows constrain planting choice and charge final pulse image. Sensory hierarchy (silence, ozone, old paper) reflects linguistic POV bias. Details evolve causally from flicker to warmth, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize arbor/translate Aris) tightens via seed planting under accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance of intangible closeness. Agency in activation forecloses physical reunion with felt cost. No abstract stakes; drift lurch viscerally tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of death as translation emerges organically from analogical actions, culminating in resonant CR: "a mere shift in dialect" reweights premise without moralizing. Particulars like stylus care avoid platitudes; ambiguity in "touching distance" invites lingering reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in linguistic filters ("gravity with grammar"). Lyrical rhythm modulates from quiet dread to warm pulse without slippage. Elevated diction fits translator's lexicon consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated into action, but dense figurative layering ("weeping iron-willows," "syntax") borders overwriting in activation beat, slightly muddling propulsion. No loops; rhythm varies purposefully. Clean syntax propels to ozone-scented closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cuneiform physics and bio-crystalline afterlife transforms tropes into inevitable linguistic closure. Risky arbor-seed fusion heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
