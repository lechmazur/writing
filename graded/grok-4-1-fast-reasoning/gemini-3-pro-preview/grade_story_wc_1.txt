<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular to glass artist (thermal memory, viscosity wait) with embodied tremors and contradictory fear/resolve acting in the frost-watch beat; final walk earned by adaptive micro-choices under survival pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from shock to frost reveal as RR/Charged Poise, cost legible in "joints stiff" and inhaled "sharp, metallic air" at closure; anchors clear by para 2, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frost lines as micro-setting constrain choice and charge final image, canyon wind/temperature sensory hierarchy POV-filtered via glass expertise; "white lace" pattern evolution mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purposeful pursuit post-betrayal) signaled early, tightens via frost deepening that forecloses blind run with embodied cost ("joints stiff"); agency in patient watch forces stance crystallization under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of invisible-visible (heat trails, ledger vibration) emerges via glass motifs shifting from aesthetic to survival, final "unbreakable form" image resonant non-literal answer reweighting pause-as-purpose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (light/shadow, thermal layers) with rhythmic modulation under stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged final image, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm propelling to dawn cadence; "drifting resonance" motif coherent without loops, metaphors (frost lace, glass hardening) purposeful and uncluttered at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh thermal-frost tracking synthesizes glass artistry with survival ingenuity, transforming betrayal trope via "earth remembering violation"; risk-taking lyric poise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
