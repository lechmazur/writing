<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism-mind trait drives key choices like twelve-trajectory calculations and doodle interpretation, earning the climax activation with embodied strain; minimal internal contradiction limits to very strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (doodle unlocks wall, frequencies revive seeds); on-page DC closure at spheres flaring with time-collapse cost legible in chronometer buzz and destabilizing ripples.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moss glow and threshold distortions constrain traversal choices, charging final descent image; sensory integration (ozone, bioluminescence) filters through prism-POV bias without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew seeds) signaled early, tightens via inversion collapse narrowing escape options with agency in surfing thresholds; cost felt in jarring landing but lacks deeper moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fractured vigilance emerging from doodle-to-seeds arc reweights premise in golden flare without statement; final convergence image resonates but ambiguity slightly undercharged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (multi-faceted physics negotiation); rhythmic control heightens pressure in "flashing between positions of stability," no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative density ("forest fire trapped inside a seed") borders overload in ascent beat without muddle; no loops, clean propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravitational paradox and metaphysical locks transforms tropes organically; risk in four-dimensional gesture pays off at unlocking, heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
