<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation singular and intensifies compellingly through micro-choices like charting fissures; interiority concrete and embodied in consciousness extension. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, yielding competent but untroubled execution without visible internal cost at peak ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from cacophony mapping to silence net; on-page RR closure via wing drop neutralizing prophecy, cost legible in "grounded flight" resonance and exhaled mist. Orientation anchored early in glade/brook; single scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (liquid obsidian water, damp ferns) filtered through mage's priorities, guiding choices (brook for wing drop); recurring brook/stream charges final image of spectral drift. Micro-setting (brook) constrains ritual payoff without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush coded prophecy) signaled early, escalates texturally via fissure-marking to net-weaving under Accumulative lens; agency in silence-mapping forecloses chaos path with unmistakable cost in "heavy velvet peace" texture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of imposed stillness disrupting doom emerges organically from particulars like wing's interrupted destiny; final image of disappearing wing offers resonant non-literal repricing without moralizing. Recurring hush motif reweights noise-to-peace arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (metaphysical mapping as cartography); rhythmic control modulates from charged blaze to vertiginous gravity under ritual pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence lengths; figurative language dense in ritual peak ("stardust and geological weight") but pattern-taught without muddle or loops obscuring closure. Minor synonym churn in "hush/quietude/peace" contained pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-magic inverting trope summons, with origami wing's severed precision enabling textural disruption; risk in paradox tone ("tranquil blaze") heightens stakes organically to charged close.</comment>
