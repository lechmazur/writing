<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's blithe cheer contrasts embodied actions like "calloused fingers manipulated the loose strands, teasing them apart," rooting motivation in consistent traits that compel the untangling without deep internal contradiction. Final smoothing of the fabric earns a credible endurance of his garden-tending philosophy with felt cost in the "mournful image." Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from inspection to thread-teasing to case revelation, yielding CR closure in "the chaotic threads...seemed to sigh, settling into a clear, mournful image of a man standing alone," with legible conceptual cost of hope's paralysis. Orientation anchored early in silo under stars; single scene causality intact, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo's curving walls and star shafts constrain vertical organization of shrouds, charging choices like border-decoding; sensory hierarchy (plush darkness, ghostly resonances) mirrors Silas's jaunty priorities. Final rustle of wind evolves setting causally post-revelation, integrating tactile navigation without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (malice vs. accident in chaos) signaled early, tightens via stubborn golden thread to case/note, narrowing to hope's distortion with agency in gentle untangling. Accumulative deepening reweights via revelation's cost in paralyzing hope, legible in settling portrait; no live option foreclosed beyond single tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-from-hope emerges organically from untangling, reweighting "spectrum of grief" in final "portrait of waiting"; resonant non-literal answer in Silas's chirp amid mournful clarity avoids moralizing. Subtext in harmonizing echoes enriches without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward jaunty noticing ("fear was just a weed to be plucked"); rhythmic texture modulates with pressure in short, punchy revelation lines. No head-hopping or withholding; diction like "velveteen gloom" coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (e.g., long atmospheric opens to crisp "It was an antique sovereign case"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figuratives like "unruly hedges" purposeful and pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in opening sensory stack doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh vertical mausoleum weaves souls by hue/sorrow, transforming cemetery trope via gardener's whimsy into CR of woven intentions; risk in lyric texture heightens ingenuity without gimmickry, inevitable in case's anchor resolving chaos.</comment>
