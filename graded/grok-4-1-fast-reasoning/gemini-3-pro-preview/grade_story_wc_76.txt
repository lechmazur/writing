<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in clockmaker traits drives assembly and lever pull with embodied anticipation ("fingers twitching... surgeon"); lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during switch throw, but earned change lands as burden dissolves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: yoyo reverse-engineering → gyroscope install → switch initiates tide reversal (DC) with legible cost in mechanism shriek and years lifting; orientation anchors in first paragraph, closure image ("destiny... dismantled and rebuilt") reconfigures fate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresnel lens and workbench constrain climax choices (amplifies radiance); hunger stone recurs to charge start/end; sensory hierarchy (brine/decay narrowing to vibration/thrumming) reflects urgency, body/tools tactile ("cold metal biting palm").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse tide/fate) signaled early, tightens via assembly to lever throw under causal lens; agency forecloses retreat path with on-page cost ("grunt of exertion... shriek"); villagers' doom secondary pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (destiny as mechanism) emerges via particulars (counter-clockwise gears unwind time); final image reweights premise non-literally ("tricked the universe with a child's toy") without moralizing, resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with clockmaker perceptual bias ("precise, gleaming constellations"); rhythmic control heightens pressure ("deep thrumming rising... soles of boots"); diction modulates exhilaration without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "fit... tightened... placed... threw" sequence clear); no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies (short peak sentences amid longer builds); figurative coherence (film reel reverse) supports without muddling climax radiance flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Yoyo-as-gyroscope premise synthesizes clockwork/fate inventively, transforming tropes via grounded reverse-engineering; bold risk (unwind earth rotation) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at "counter-clockwise motion" climax.</comment>
