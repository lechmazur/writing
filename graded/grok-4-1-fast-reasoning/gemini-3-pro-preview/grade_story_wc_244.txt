<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arthur's contradictory impulses—jocular shield versus raw vulnerability—act simultaneously, culminating in the earned renunciation of the rock; interiority is concrete and embodied throughout, with the grin masking terror perfectly revealing character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably, building to Charged Poise closure when Arthur tosses the rock ("clattered indistinguishably among the earthly gravel"); orientation anchored early, one tightening via visitor's arrival narrows options with legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-overgrown station and platform constrain pivotal choice (rock tossed onto tracks) and charge final image (notes through ivy retreat silence); sensory details like "ambient drip of rainwater" are POV-filtered and purposeful, mirroring internal chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure loneliness via celestial trade) signaled early, deepens via woman's song offer forcing renunciation with visible cost (rock destroyed); coherent pressure under Accumulative lens reweights options without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability over barter emerges organically from rock toss and music's retreat of silence, offering resonant non-literal answer ("logic of the heart had finally taken over"); subtext in dialogue and images avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (wry, textured noticing like "invoices never asked why he was crying"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("A rumor is just a truth that's had a few drinks"), voices distinct without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm (e.g., short punchy dialogue amid lyrical beats); zero loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful and coherent, no overwriting in peak ("tossed the moon rock onto the tracks").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc barter world with moon rock for intimacy transforms tropes; risky shift to "quiet narrative" at marked timeframe heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
