<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove emotional imprints drives ritual choices consistently; Mara's skepticism yields earned shift at "He didn't leave in anger." Minor slip: limited contradictory impulses shown in Elias's interiority during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via chill, hush, to frost vision CR; cost legible in melting patterns and "burden... released." Orientation anchored early in arbor; single tightening at prism refraction holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz spires and mist constrain ritual by enabling frost, charging final melting image; sensory hierarchy (chill, hush) mirrors ethereal pursuit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Skepticism vs. proof escalates accumulatively to hush/vision tightening; cost felt in Mara's tears confronting "memory you invented."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotional echoes in objects emerges via frost silhouettes reweighting anger myth; resonant non-literal close in melting frost avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias to "geometry of sorrow"; dialogue subtextual, distinct (Mara's "just a car" vs. Elias's "echoes").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel hush beat; minor "truthful lies" repetition slightly drags without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frost fractals as emotional architecture transforms mystic trope; irreplaceable prism-on-ice synthesis feels inevitable at vision.</comment>
