<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to preserve hope drives consistent micro-choices like softly deliberate approach and stone offering, with embodied contradiction in "deep chord of finality" and final regret showing earned stasis. Interiority particular via shadow perception and chest vibration. Final placement forecloses wholeness for woman with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from footage comparison to shadow capture, culminating in CR via stone transformation and final image of "hands, bathed in that relentless brilliance," with legible conceptual cost of erased depth. Orientation anchored early in library. One tightening via shadow sensing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "photosynthesizing verbs" and "phosphorescent spores" filter through Elian's priorities, constraining shadow capture (light vs. gloom). Recurring glow charges final image of "golden, unceasing afternoon... suffocating."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve shadows/hope) signaled early, escalates via textural density to metamorphosis narrowing options; agency in whisper and offering forces trade-off, with cost crystallized in "victory was steep" and regret image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hope as "carved-out space where light was missing" emerges organically from footage discrepancy and shadow fusion; final image reweights unity's premise with conceptual cost of shallowness, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in contrast-noticing ("stretching silhouette" vs. no shadow); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in transformation beat, elisions purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent and purposeful (e.g., "smoke" for unbound shadow), no loops or artifacts dulling closure. Propulsion aligns with textural buildup to silent metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-collective erasing shadows transforms dystopian trope via geode fusion; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from footage to shelf placement.</comment>
