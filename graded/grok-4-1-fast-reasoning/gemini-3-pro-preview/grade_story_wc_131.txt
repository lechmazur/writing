<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's yearning for visibility is embodied in the "quiet, aching yearning pulled at his chest" and drives contradictory impulses—stealth vs. risky placement—culminating in earned reconfiguration of isolation. Micro-choices like "crawling backward with...precision" reveal values under pressure. Flawless single-POV interiority with no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rattle to tape discovery ("fingers...struck something rigid") to flicker-timed caching, yielding Charged Poise closure in "heavy cloak...dissolve into the light" with felt cost of risked exposure. Orientation anchored early in atrium/ceiling. One tightening via sense memory suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vent grates and service hatch constrain choices throughout, charging final gaze "lingering...on the high vents." Sensory hierarchy (blue light, dust lint, tape texture) filters via Elias's infrastructure bias, evolving with flicker to lights-on. Micro-setting as "setting" integrates perfectly without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility without intrusion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to flicker "window of opportunity," narrowing via risky hatch slip with legible cost ("risky proximity"). Agency in caching forces renunciation of pure erasure. Cost unmistakable in final felt dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden providence emerges organically via tape bridge and gaze, reweighting isolation in final image without moralizing. Sense memory motif shifts from personal trigger to shared discovery, embracing ambiguity of unseen connection. Resonant non-literal answer to visibility question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Elias with perceptual signature in infrastructure metaphors ("steel reinforcements," "copper pipes"). Rhythmic control modulates from hush to electric wonder; purposeful poetic diction taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers, calloused but impossibly gentle, brushed aside decades of gray lint"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Figurative language purposeful (e.g., "hollow-boned fossils"), no muddle or loops in peak caching beat. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crawl space dweller as tactile sense-memory angel transforms guardian trope via pipe-chase specificity and flicker risk. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from methodical stealth to charged gaze. Bold atmospheric voice heightens stakes organically.</comment>
