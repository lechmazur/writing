<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Singular motivation rooted in loss drives all micro-choices, from diving to unscrewing the jar; contradictory impulses peak in weeping amid violet ribbons, earning the final release of fear with embodied cost. Internal voice particularized through lamplighter lens ("curated the boundary"). Flawlessly integrates hides-behind-truth trait in dual instances without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oriented instantly (lamplighter on pier plunging to Aurelia); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure in jar-opening revelation, where violet-gold ribbons reprice the vow's truth with emotional cost legible in "tears indistinguishable from the ocean." Single scene causality tight, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains navigation ("collapsed bulkheads and debris fields"); bioluminescent jars and silted deck charge climax image, mirroring internal hush-to-light via lanterns above. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (brass weights, bone-resonating hum); micro-setting (key tag lodestone) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vow's color) signaled early, texturally escalates via purposeful wandering to jar climax narrowing knowledge; agency in signifying with key forces trade-off, with cost crystallized in missed-sunrise realization. One tightening sufficient, charges final ascent image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vow-truth emerges implicitly from luminous jars and color-sound synesthesia, reweighted non-literally in "sunrise he had missed" finale without moralizing; hides-truth motif complicates without binaries, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (silence as "meteor hush," water "shimmering with reflected light"); rhythmic modulation peaks in hum-to-ribbons bloom; no dialogue, elisions purposeful and paid in revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "ribbons of iridescent violet and gold" does image/emotion/closure); figurative coherence purposeful without muddle, rhythm varies naturally; minor density in opening metaphors doesn't touch peak jar beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Core premise (luminous vows as color-sound spectra) ingeniously synthesizes synesthesia/worldbuilding, transforming sunken-ship trope via vow-archive logic; risk in abstract sensory payoff inevitable via key-jar causality, fresh without gimmick.</comment>
