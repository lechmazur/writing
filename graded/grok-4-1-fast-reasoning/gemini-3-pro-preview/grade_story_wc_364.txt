<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Meek traits shown through avoidance of crowds and trembling hand contrast well with resolve in deliberate boot steps, earning the descent choice; minor slip in stock "simple-mindedness" phrasing slightly genericizes interiority without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with motivated ellipsis from anvil to mine to barter, delivering DC closure when silk dissolves into energy veins; orientation anchored early in planet fracturing and Ewan's forge; one tightening via fluctuating gravity descent suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and mine shafts constrain descent choice and charge realignment thunder payoff; surreal viscosity sensory detail mirrors stakes purposefully; geode chamber integrates tactilely with barter action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax resilience) signaled early tightens via descent risks and barter trade-off, with agency in whispering offer; cost legible in silk sacrifice foreclosing trickster tool; minor abstractness in stakes scale vs. on-page isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Barter of lie for truth emerges organically from silk wrapping and azure flare, reweighting resilience premise in final forge image; avoids moralizing with quiet hero ambiguity; minor counter-reading potential in unearned planetary consciousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (blacksmith noticing stanchion, anvil) and rhythmic modulation in descent viscosity; poetic diction like "spider-glass and theatrical whispers" purposeful and voice-motivated; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy descent sentences building to hum vibration; high density in barter scene integrates action/image; minor overwriting in "shimmering threads transmuting into veins" risks muddle but pattern-taught as magical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blacksmith bartering illusion-silk for planetary gravity transforms tropes organically; risk in "perfect lie for harsh truth" paradox inevitable in hindsight via geode payoff; no derivative echoes.</comment>
