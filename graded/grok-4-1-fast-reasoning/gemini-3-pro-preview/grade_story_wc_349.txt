<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's obsession with narrative origins is embodied in his precise demo actions and scalpel-hiding smile, revealing blind spots that complicate his altruism. Contradictory impulses emerge as profit/altruism masks deeper compulsion, earning the final poised anticipation. Interiority concrete via quantifying absence, with no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shop stillness through demo to motivation reveal, landing CR closure in "their erasure was merely Elian’s map," with conceptual cost of conditional parole legible in "shimmered with the ghost." Orientation anchored early in Elian/shop/opening lull. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of craft shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard's chiming boughs and cloud updrafts constrain demo via silica trunks/alcove; recurring glass apples charge final rainbow refraction, mirroring fragmentation. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (crystalline silence, shadow-cutting). Micro-setting (brass scale, flask) alters tactics in erasure process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quest for story genesis) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via demo tightening (quantify → incise → moonlight), narrowing to customer arrival with felt cost of hidden scalpel/ghostly residue. Agency in unconventional craft forecloses innate innocence path. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of conditional erasure emerges organically from "glimmering parole" result, reweighted in final "map to the source" without moralizing. Spectral residue image answers origin-seeking question non-literally, embracing ambiguity of granted vs. innate purity. No tidy resolution; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature attuned to absences/shadows, modulating rhythm from crystalline calm to shrieking incision. Prose texture crystalline/poetic matches world; diction controlled (void-glass, diamond-edged). No head-hopping; compression purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "flask of bottled moonlight" advances craft/atmosphere). Varied rhythm accelerates in "high-pitched shriek" beat; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Figurative language pattern-taught via glass motif integrates without overwriting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of erasure craft (quantifying absence, moonlight solvent) transforms regret-redemption trope into origin-hunt, risking poetic conceit that coheres via demo logic. Final scalpel-hide turns bold, heightening stakes organically. Irreplaceable world/voice premise.</comment>
