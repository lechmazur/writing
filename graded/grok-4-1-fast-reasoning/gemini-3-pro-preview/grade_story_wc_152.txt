<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa's contradictory impulses—frail fumbling with Kael versus blurring-speed sewing alone—act simultaneously in scene, earning her final choice to encode the warning with visible risk to her survival mask.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds from Kael's demand to Lysa's secret sewing, landing DC closure in "The map rippled" with legible cost of her isolation and conspiracy exposure; orientation anchored in opening lines; lens causal throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt dome's acoustics enable disguise and amplify wind-tension, constraining Lysa's dual act; autumn vines and blue stone charge final image of shaking glass mirroring captured truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embed warning in chart) tightens via Kael's two-day deadline narrowing options; agency in synchronizing needle forecloses blind obedience path with exposure cost felt in her slumped mask resumption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth-in-disguise emerges organically from stitching betrayal into "aesthetic swirl," reweighting Lysa's frailty as power in final image without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (stars as "slippery," thread as time); distinct voices in sparse dialogue—Kael's booming demands vs. Lysa's croaking evasion—carry subtext and advance pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("needle dipped and dived"); varied rhythm matches intensity, no loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere around weaving without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroiderer encoding quantum conspiracies transforms wise-crone trope; "unraveling conspiracies by stitching them into plain sight" feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
