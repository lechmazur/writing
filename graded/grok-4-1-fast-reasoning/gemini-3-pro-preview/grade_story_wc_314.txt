<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly when Elara tries to count the starlings but silences her analytical mind, earning the surrender to wonder; interiority particular via ribbon talisman and embodied awe flooding her chest. Final choice compelled by prior motivation with felt cost of denying logic. No unearned epiphanies or label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from crystal setup to bird patterns catalyzing flame; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "the rigid barriers...dissolve" and picking up the warm jewel. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall veils patterns for birds while darkening sky constrains timing, charging final breeze image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: analytical dismissal of prophecies shifts to tactile mist-breath mingling. Micro-setting (moss table, crystal) evolves causally without static repetition; 9+ gate met via environmental constraint on choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform crystal before degradation) signaled early, tightens via bird clarity forcing intuitive snap over logic; agency in flame-summon reweights options with visible cost of missed alignment. Escalation accumulative through sky darkening and awe surge; cost unmistakable in stabilized gemstone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of logic-intuition harmony emerges organically via crystal softening "guided by the unspoken geometry"; final image recharges prior conflict non-literally as "universe...built on wonder." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like ribbon and starlings without tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: analytical vectors yield to "visceral, electric" wonder; diction/rhythm modulate from rigid to fluid syntax mirroring arc. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at flame snap; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with pressure (short awe sentences at climax); high density integrates action-image-thought without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("bruised purple," "jagged teardrop") coherent in lyric mode but slightly overwrites opening; zero artifacts touch closure image of warm jewel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical trope via starling geometry and sentiment catalyzing silver flame; transforms prophecy whispers into "statistical noise." Risky lyric build heightens stakes without gimmickry; inevitable hindsight from orchard constraints.</comment>
