<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in trembling hand during frantic sketching and panic in throat; final resolve shift earned by glimpse causality, foreclosing fear path with isolation cost felt in chest-hardening moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed sketch to pattern glimpse (cadence shift), delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where "chaotic swirls were... a language" reweights chaos as topography with sanity cost legible in steady hand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observation deck and distorted ribbons constrain sanity-mapping choice, charging final cartographer image; sensory hierarchy (heavy echoed silence, dying gravity hum) mirrors internal churn purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor sanity via True North) signaled early, tightens via glimpse-driven deepening that forecloses desperation; agency in renunciation of fear shows visible cost in displaced isolation, though internal focus mutes external pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of order-in-chaos emerges organically from sketch failures to realization; final image ("imposing order onto the paper") offers resonant non-literal answer to mapping-a-hurricane premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sci-fi lyricism (e.g., "wet brush to a painting"); rhythmic modulation accelerates at glimpse, sustaining texture under resolve pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration, but minor overwrite in "god had taken a wet brush" string slightly muddles peak glare-squint beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Singularity-edge sketching transforms isolation trope via geometric language in chaos; compass irony and pariah premise synthesize fresh explorer arc, risking lyric sci-fi boldness that heightens closure stakes.</comment>
