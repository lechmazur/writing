<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal war—"sworn duty to preservation warred violently with her loyalty"—embodies contradiction, compelling the switch throw with clear cost to her world; Kael's arrival adds relational crucible without diluting her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain tightens via Kael's entry as opposition, landing DC closure in "threw the switch" with legible cost in "color drain from Kael’s face"; single scene, lens holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Archaic copper cabling and analog speakers buried deep" constrain her bypass method and charge the crackling revival image; sensory filter (frigid seals, blue-lit monoliths) biases archivist POV vividly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's "blast doors hissed open" forces agency in switch throw, foreclosing silence with stakes crystallized in "scandal... vibration in the air"; cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Love letter strips deity myths, emerging implicitly; "new, terrifying warmth" offers resonant CR reweighting cold society's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with archivist perceptual signature ("physical artifact that theoretically should not exist"); diction/rhythm modulate tension seamlessly, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "silence... pressed against the temples and blurred the vision"; metaphors cohere (ice tomb to thawing firestorm), propelling rhythm to climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Analog broadcast bypassing quantum censors transforms dystopia tropes via cryogenic archive premise; "mechanical loop" of lovers' letter risks bold ingenuity heightening closure.</comment>
