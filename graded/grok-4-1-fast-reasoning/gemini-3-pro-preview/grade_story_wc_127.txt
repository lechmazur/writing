<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silas's affectionate detachment and static-sensing show contradictory impulses acting in scene (no pity despite sensing agony), earning her transformation with visible cost in glassy serenity. Elara's surrender reveals hierarchy of values. Final micro-choice to seal blotter reinforces professional limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from prep/explanation to inhalation, culminating in on-page RR (static settles into silence) with conceptual cost of absolute illusion over raw reality. "The panic was gone, replaced by..." makes before/after legible. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber grotto's resinous light/glow constrains and mirrors shift, charging final image as it "seemed to glow brighter, reflecting the synthetic warmth." Static on skin as micro-setting ties body to stakes. Sensory hierarchy (visual/tactile) reflects Silas's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief relief via half-truths) signaled early, textural escalation via inhalation deepens to transformation, narrowing to bearable nostalgia with legible cost in "glassy, serene understanding that looked like wisdom but felt like sedation." Agency in surrender/application.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Half-truths emerge organically from blotter explanation/action, resonant CR in final image reweighting raw reality as unaffordable commodity without moralizing. "Turned it into a story she could live with" offers non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (static as emotion gauge); rhythmic prose modulates from precise detachment to charged poise. Dialogue subtextual ("No... I do not deal in erasures"), advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm/syntax propel without loops; metaphors cohere (honeyed gloom to synthetic warmth). No artifacts dull closure; "static charge... smooth out" propels peak beat crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-dealer premise via static-sensing/scent transforms grief trope; risk in half-truth CR heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via blotter payoff.</comment>
