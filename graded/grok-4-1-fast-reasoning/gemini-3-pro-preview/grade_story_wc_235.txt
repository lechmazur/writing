<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in jealousy-fueled trance ("feral nostalgia that tears at my throat with wolfish teeth"), compelling the writing choice with embodied cost of isolation; interiority particular and flawed without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from grave shock to dream flight to writing's CR, reweighting time paradox with undeniable conceptual cost in final line ("straight line drawn through the tangle of time"); orientation anchored early, one tightening via jealousy suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scroll and cabin chill constrain choices and charge final image ("texture rough against my fingertips... scratches loudly"); sensory hierarchy (ozone vs pine) reflects POV urgency, integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor against confusion) deepens via dream's life-loop view, narrowing to writing's endurance under lens; cost legible in dream burnout ("cold ash of reality") and dark isolation, though no micro-turn caps escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("ghost haunting my own history") offers resonant CR to nostalgia's violence vs narrative rebellion, reweighting premise without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet texture of the mind... cracks in the sky’s rendering") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure, stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("The room dissolves into smoke"); varied rhythm, no loops or muddled figs, purposeful metaphors consistent (e.g., "slurry of disjointed moments") without overwriting in peak dream beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grave trope via jealousy-trance and jaded dream chronicler; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risk-taking in nonlinear texture heightens time stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
