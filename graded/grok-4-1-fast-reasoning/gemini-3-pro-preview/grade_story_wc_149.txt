<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Julian's desperation embodied in wary navigation and whisper, with final mournful elation showing contradictory impulses; ghost's debt motivation clear and compels climax choice, but Julian's passivity limits deeper internal conflict in pivotal summoning beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: bead summons (inciting), teases escalate to coalescence (climax), exchange severs link (DC closure) with legible emotional cost in final collapse and grief; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alchemical greenhouse flora constrains choices via venomous threat during navigation; contrasts with outer winter charge final image of settling orchard and Julian's departure, with sensory selectivity sharpening urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure via debt) signaled early, tightens causally from summoning to full manifestation and exchange; agency in bead use, cost felt in guardian loss charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Debt across lives emerges organically via exchange, resolved in mournful elation that reweights survival with loss; final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward heat-seeking plants and glimpses; rhythmic prose modulates tension, distinct texture in gothic lyricism sustains through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with action (e.g., tendrils "hunted"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent and purposeful even in peak exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancestral debt, arcane botany, and spectral bride transforms ghost trope; risk in narcotic flora and mental intent heightens stakes organically to inevitable bittersweet close.</comment>
