<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "deletion felt like murder," compelling reconfiguration with embodied agony in compression; final endurance of past's cost earns unified soul.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: reversal static therefore box transfer, chaos therefore miniaturize, burst therefore desert exit; DC closure ("static was gone") lands with farm abandonment cost in final look back.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome and roses constrain climax chaos threat and charge final image ("shimmering under a slightly different sky"); organic internals enable cable connection amid ozone shed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightens via agency-driven compression under reversal pressure, foreclosing wipe with dome-shatter risk; cost legible in "incinerated the past" propulsion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of purging attachment emerges via fear-box burn reweighting nostalgia; final empty box silhouette answers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in mech-organic blend ("pulsating tubes... like ivy"); rhythmic modulation heightens compression stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("He clenched... fans screaming"); coherent metaphors ("psychic hurricane," "neutron star") without muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia, fear-box fuel, pole-shift crisis transforms tropes; risk in organic-machine purge heightens irreplaceable closure.</comment>
