<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contemplative glassblower's contradictory impulses—buoyant narration to ghosts versus frantic silence—act simultaneously, earning the migration choice with cost of abandoning the dome; internal conflict embodied in soot-creased smile and pipe rotation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with melting density (boom, shriek, tilt) tightening to Charged Poise closure: "stepped through the blast door... into the weeping slush," reconfiguring isolation with undeniable cost of forsaken monument dome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains pivotal choice—"groaning steel demanded... abandon"—and charges final image of slush descent; selective sensory details (roaring furnace, dripping landscape) mirror internal thaw without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (craft sanctuary vs. flee collapse) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven tightening (packing despite tilt), foreclosing stay-option with on-page cost of irreplaceable dome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of messy thaw enabling growth emerges organically from glass colors shifting "violent yellow to calming red" and final slush invitation; resonant non-literal answer reweights isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (furnace as "defiant orange beast"); narration to objects carries subtext of sanity-preservation, modulating rhythm with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops, purposeful lyric metaphors ("weeping landscape") integrate action; peak tilt beat vivid without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower forging "pockets of clarity" amid regime-thaw transforms isolation trope; risk of weighty lightness voice heightens stakes organically.</comment>
