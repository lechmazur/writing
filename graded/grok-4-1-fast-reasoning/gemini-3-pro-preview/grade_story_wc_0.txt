<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between scientific detachment and iridescent beauty act in scene, earning the final fingertip touch as a micro-choice with emotional cost piercing objectivity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observational density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure; overlay falter and dust touch make before/after legible with humbled cost in final exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring butterfly wing dust as micro-setting constrains focus and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (humid rot, drip, fogged breath) filters through Elias' implant bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Internal stake (physics vs. drama) tightens via overlay falter under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance of beauty with legible cost; single deepening suffices but lacks sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final dust flake on fingertip reweights premise of stripped drama with resonant humility, emerging organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (preprocessed wireframes, macro dissolution) and rhythmic modulation sustain close third under pressure, with implant elision taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (nebula shimmer); no loops or artifacts dull the closure image of settling dust topography.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of neutron star analysis applied to butterfly dust post-flood feels inevitable; cosmic-micro perspective risks bold perceptual scale without gimmickry.</comment>
