<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's motivation rooted in compulsion drives concrete micro-choices like psychometry trance and vial pour; interiority particular via olfactory focus. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, but single-POV competence under pressure earns discovery with embodied tremble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to pattern break at drop-induced groan, yielding CR closure in sealing jar with "trembling fingers" as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in factory valley; no shards, causality tight via compass to fissure to awakening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (scents dominant) filters through Silas's priorities, constraining rebreather use and vial pour; cavern's "resonant hush" and obsidian water charge final image. Limestone "hinges" evolve causally, mirroring internal quest without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of mystery) signaled early, deepens via psychometry-guided delve to metaphysical reveal narrowing to pour-choice under descent pressure. Accumulative escalation via density to cadence shift at walls folding; cost legible in vindicated compass warmth and tremble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of industrial vs. ancient magic emerges from particulars like smog-to-earth-dream scents; final vial as "surrender to unknown" reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from hinged reveal without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on magic's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in scent-obsessed diction; rhythmic modulation peaks at "cavern groaned," heightening mystery. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short descent bursts to expansive reveal); no loops or scaffolds, figurative language purposeful like "bleached bones" cliffs. Propulsion peaks unmarred in "water rippled outward" causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry-compass to hinged dimensions transforms scent-hunt trope; risk in metaphysical pivot feels inevitable from gear/essence setup. Bold voice commits to steampunk-magic without retreat.</comment>
