<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via scars as "topography" and gentle handling of box reveals contradictory impulses (rough hands/reverence); final release earned by causal reflection on fire's duality. Minor therapy-speak in "bargained innocence" but anchored to present micro-choice of scattering soot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in soot-scattering image ("burden lightened by the gravity of the truth"); orientation anchored early in hike details; cost legible in evaporated bitterness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Burn zone "skeletal remains" and scorched boulder constrain hike/ritual, charging final soot drift; sensory hierarchy (frigid air, wind bite) reflects firefighter POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate pain) deepens via reflection on combustion duality, narrowing to scattering act under accumulative lens; cost felt in foreclosed solitary confinement, but internal only limits visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of creation/destruction siblings emerges organically from kiln/wildfire line to soot image reweighting scars as "receipts"; resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in fire/ash metaphors; rhythmic modulation peaks in "more prayer than toss," heightening release without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short wind-bite sentence into scatter); no loops, purposeful metaphors integrate action; minor density in opening constellations but propels to peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter scars and porcelain soot ritual transforms grief trope; risk in lyric reflection pays off at cosmic scatter without gimmick.</comment>
