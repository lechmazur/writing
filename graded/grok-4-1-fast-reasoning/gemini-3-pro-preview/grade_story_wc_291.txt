<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's prosopagnosia yields concrete interiority via "topographic maps of skin and bone," driving methodical choices like precise easel adjustment; flaw balances competence without safety-hedging. Miller's skepticism forces relational crucible, crumbling at the portrait's impact. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in Silas caps at strong publishable execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layers build to canvas piercing—"lance the center of the charcoal pupil"—delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where artwork reconfigures indifference with Miller's hitched breath as felt cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in quarry. No ambiguity or breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist "dampening sound" and "uneven, slate-grey ground" constrain actions like easel checks and charge final "image on the easel burned through the grey." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (topographic quarry). Micro-setting (ribbon, stylus) integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken empathy—tightens texturally via density increase to piercing/ribbon merge, forcing Miller's stance crystallization with visible cost in crumbled expression. Agency in Silas's decisive movements; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art striking "directly at the heart" emerges organically from textures colliding, resonant in final mirror of tragedy without moralizing. Returning silk/stone reweights premise; emotional aftereffect in Miller's grief lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable with perceptual signature in "topographic maps"; diction/rhythm textured like "swirl of black and grey." Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("The geometry remains"). No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy sentences at peak ("With a sudden, decisive movement"); high density integrates action/image without loops or scaffolds. Minor dense metaphors purposeful under voice; propulsion clean to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prosopagnosic artist's abstract portrait transforms cold case trope via piercing/ribbon ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risky textural synthesis heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
