<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust drives desperate, embodied choices like reckless pouring and vow-weaving, earning relational change with emotional cost. Kael's passivity limits status dynamics, but his bag-drop reaction reveals recognition under pressure. Contradictory impulses (precision amid volatility) act in climax without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ink-pouring incites tangle, vows cause harmonization, yielding Charged Poise closure as Kael takes her hand across pulsing script—cost legible in risked estrangement and near-room destruction. Single scene anchored early (archive, diverging paths). No orientation debt; lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ink well constrains choices (threatened shatter, final bridge) and charges closure image, with sensory hum/screech/vibrations narrowing Elara's focus amid crisis. Vivid, POV-filtered details like refracted "dangerous gold" integrate into action. Spatial choreography coherent; archive subtly mirrors resurrection theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust pre-departure) signaled early, escalates causally via violent tangle forcing vow-agency, narrowing options with physical/emotional cost in climax weaving. Tightening forecloses silence path; Kael's forward step crystallizes stance. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration pre-test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic truth bridging estrangement emerges organically from Veritas Aeterna's mechanics and vow-binding, resonating in final "new language forged" image without moralizing. Subtext in aggressive honesty pressures complexity. Returning ink well reweights silence-to-bridge arc non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elara POV with perceptual signature (linguistic metaphors like "twisted syntax"). Prose rhythm modulates intensity; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I promise...") advances plot. No head-hopping; diction purposeful, fantasy-inflected without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("dangerous gold," "aggressive honesty") slightly muddles peak sensory clarity without harming closure. Strong verbs/images integrate action; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic magic as emotional crucible transforms reconciliation trope; Veritas Aeterna's truth-forcing rules enable bold, inevitable vow-climax from established archive premise. Risky air-writing/unsnarling heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
