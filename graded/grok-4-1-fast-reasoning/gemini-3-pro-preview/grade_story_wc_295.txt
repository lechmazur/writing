<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions drives consistent micro-choices like breath-matching the star, culminating in earned healing words. Interiority embodied via star-guided submersion; no strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps at 8.7. Duty as chronicler reveals character under dream pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of stars/inscriptions/burden builds to CR closure where "heaviness gone" reconfigures telegram with metabolized cost. Orientation anchored early in observatory; dream shard transitions legible, one tightening via witnessing/speaking. Cost legible in final fragmentation and translation flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory/micro-setting (telegram, ocular) constrains entry and charges reprise; dream temple writhing glyphs evolve causally, mirroring internal release. Sensory hierarchy via POV (star pulses as lexicon) selective/purposeful. Final sun-on-face image recharges motifs without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode trauma glyphs) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via dream confrontation and words-as-keys. Agency in witnessing/speaking forecloses burden path with felt dispersal cost. One tightening sufficient under lens; minor abstract stakes legibility in "universe's capacity" prevents higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trauma as cosmic syntax emerges via glyph stabilization and burden dispersal, reweighting "temple inscriptions... about the human need to be heard." Resonant CR ending via decoded script without moralizing; subtext in shared agony witnessed. Particulars (stars, words) drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (stars as heartbeats/lungs); voice modulates rhythmically from midnight density to dawn cadence. Spoken words natural/subtextual, advancing healing. No head-hopping; diction controlled for lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts, propulsion aligns with pressure (e.g., mist dissolution accelerates). Minor overwrought figuration ("velvet quiet," "breathing lung") in opener doesn't touch closure. Read-aloud ear strong, specificity replaces generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: variable stars as trauma syntax, dream chronicler decoding glyphs via words transforms dream-trope organically. Bold risk in esoteric method heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight via starlight-weaving. No derivative echoes.</comment>
