<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory obsession drives trance despite professional hydraulic logic, embodied in decelerating heartbeat and arm-shaking resistance; final wrenching break to zero earns renunciation with shattering focus cost, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds ritual density to razor-edge reveal and CR closure in "shattering his focus to break the connection," with undeniable conceptual cost in key drop and refracted silence; orientation anchors early, lens holds cleanly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Damp fjord glassiness and hydraulic thrum filter through shepherd's bias, constraining key ritual against sluice world; recurring horizon blade charges final image, satisfying 9+ test without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to pierce time illusion escalates via density to key-turn trap, forcing stance crystallization with torque vertigo cost; one decisive deepening suffices under accumulative lens, though agency thins slightly in passive "trapped" moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Time-as-butchery emerges organically from key severance vs. water mercy, final "pause before the next incision" reweighting premise without moralizing, fulfilling 9+ test via resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases to fluid/geared contrasts with rhythmic texture ("razor edges sliced through the stillness"); no head-hopping, diction modulates under stress, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax and zero loops, though minor figurative density risks muddle in "serrated blade sawing against his vision" without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh hydraulic-vs-mantle synthesis transforms time trope into visceral slices, with ritual risk heightening stakes inevitably; bold conceptual commitment feels singular and transformed, earning 9+ via hindsight inevitability.</comment>
