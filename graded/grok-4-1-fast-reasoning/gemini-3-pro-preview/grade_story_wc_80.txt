<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in precise writing of the old woman's dream and straining to wrest the stone, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; final satisfaction earns closure via prior micro-choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as actions layer toward CR closure in "hushed blaze of satisfaction," reweighting sinking city with enduring dreams; cost legible in physical strain and city's loss, anchors clear by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion's fissure and chest-high water constrain repair choice, charging final image; sensory details (brine, lantern glow, silt) filtered through Elias's priorities mirror grief without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve dreams) signaled early, escalates via wresting stone that tests commitment and narrows options; under Accumulative lens, density deepens to Charged Poise with felt physical/emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interlaced absence emerges organically through vial embedding, final image reconfigures loss into load-bearing entity without moralizing; resonant answer to preservation vs. sinking via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "vibrated with the silent grief," rhythmic control heightens quiet intensity; elision of backstory anchors present acts without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in repair sequence ("gripped slipping... gritted teeth"), varied rhythm; minor overwrought figuration ("emotional fossils") fits voice but caps at 8.8 without perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor embedding dreams transforms sinking-city trope via interlaced absence; risk in philosophical method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from vial payoff.</comment>
