<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives micro-choices like slotting the hearing aid despite protocol and danger, embodied in trembling thumb and cold sweat; internal shift from puzzle-solving to protection feels earned without epiphany labels. Contradictory impulses—knowing it's "precarious" yet refusing to leave—act simultaneously at inciting incident. Minor stock phrasing like "persistently curious" slightly abstracts motivation before climax shield-forging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: object signals and mist density build to RR closure in photo-change and silence, with cost in her gasping slump against fountain. Orientation anchored early (atrium, twilight, job). Linkages tighten meaningfully—hearing aid amplifies to child fear, directing body-as-antenna to ceiling peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and shadows constrain choices (swirl violently, lunge at climax), charging final settled mist image; glass ceiling orients signal peak. Sensory hierarchy (ozone smell, static roar) reflects tracer priorities, integrated via goal-action. Body as micro-setting (turning like antenna) heightens pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace/protect faint heart-signal) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via flutter realization and shadow lunge forcing projection trade-off. Agency in whispers/photo-beacon forecloses devouring path with her exhaustion cost legible in final slump. One decisive deepening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-anchoring against oblivion emerges via particulars (empty bench to smiling blur); final image non-literally answers "unsaid goodbyes" without moralizing. Subtext in refusal to incinerate charges incidental heroism organically. Lingering ambiguity (child's fate oblique) invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (arterial lines, jagged rhythms); whispers natural, goal-pursuing ("I hear you"). Rhythmic control modulates to short sentences at feedback peak. Voice texture distinct, biased to tracer idiom without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in climax (static roar to feedback whine escalates rhythmically); no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("hummingbird flutter," "breaking wave") in setup doesn't muddle peak clarity. Varied syntax breathes with pressure, vivid specifics replace generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral-tracing via hearing aid pulses transforms ghost trope into bureaucratic puzzle; incidental heroism from curiosity risks bold world-logic payoff in photo-repricing. No derivative echoes; premise implications (heart-lines persist) fully committed, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
