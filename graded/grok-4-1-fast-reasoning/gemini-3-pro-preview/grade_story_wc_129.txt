<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft onto the community drives concrete micro-choices like dropping reeds to help the boy, embodying bold sympathy with visible cost; internal conflict emerges in her outsider fragility contrasting group stoicism, earning the final communal acceptance without epiphanic telling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through image density building to Charged Poise closure: weaving reeds on the tag-etched arbor reconfigures her outsider status with felt fragility cost, legible in "barriers dissolve" and final hand placements; orientation anchors crisply by paragraph 2, one tightening via boy incident to discovery suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain choices (razor-dust knee scrape, light-drinking shadows) and charge final image (reeds embracing stone); sensory hierarchy filters through Elara's sculptor bias, with thermal chimes and prism-light mirroring her "luminescent ache" without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community inclusion) tightens accumulatively via boy aid enabling discovery, narrowing options to her weaving response; agency in dedicatory act forecloses isolation with relational cost felt in merged "fragility with their strength," charging final image under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of soft sympathy bridging hard uniformity emerges organically from reeds-vs-crystal contrast, reweighted in final woven arbor image offering non-literal answer to outsider integration without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "dying life" embracing eternal stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in tactile, organic notices (reeds' humidity vs. arid crystal); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive breadth to compressed intensity at weaving ("deft fingers... hammering against her ribs"), no head-hopping, elision taught early via silence motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (chimes' "luminescent ache" recurs to charge closure) varies rhythm effectively; minor paraphrase loops in "webs of kinship" metaphor (−0.3) but no scaffold or muddle touching peak weave/dedicate beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-language silence, organic decay vs. crystalline perfection, and vandalism ritual transforms tropes into inevitable outsider grafting via reed sculpture; risk in hum defying muteness heightens stakes organically.</comment>
