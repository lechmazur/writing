<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fossil as transitional object reveals interior contradiction between logic and chaos in "letting the fossil dig into her palm," grounding obsessive motivation and earning shift to interpreter without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to signal spike and float; CR closure in "She had stepped into the dark and brought back a language" reconfigures her role with isolation cost legible in final fossil rub.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coastal cave's "salt and ionized iron" and black lagoon constrain descent and float, charging final "basalt ledge" return; fossil micro-setting anchors tactile sanity amid thermal auroras.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake to voice unknown tightens via signal spike and float under Accumulative lens, narrowing to regeneration realization; sanity cost felt in fossil clutch but lacks deeper trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration emerges from heat-map particulars and fossil bridge, resonant in wind-as-breath image reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in quantum biology filters like "swirling aurora of grief"; rhythmic modulation heightens float suspension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in thermal gradients advances momentum; minor overwriting in "factually mystical" strains but pattern-taught poeticism supports lyric drive without closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quantum emotion-mapping fused with fossil psychology transforms post-hibernation trope; risk in "factually mystical" caves pays off in CR healing image.</comment>
