<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exiled tutor's ruthless competence and guilt create contradictory impulses, embodied in fidgeting that sharpens focus and final pull of the anchor knot with felt cost of ending stasis. Backstory anchors present via concrete cues like the labyrinth, tilting choices without flattening pressure. Final choice to sacrifice comfort earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: observation of weakening barrier because/therefore walk to archive, decode tapestry, pull knot causing DC in ripple and water splash. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (market square, frozen village). Closure lands on-page with legible cost in "resistance snapped" and exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring labyrinth and tapestry constrain choices (winnowing threads) and charge final image (labyrinth clicks solved). Sensory details like "ozone and regret" and evolving smoke pillars mirror internal stasis, integrated into action. No white-room; spatial choreography clear from fountain to archive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end stasis for self-forgiveness) signaled early, tightens via thunder escalation and air resistance narrowing options to anchor knot pull. Protagonist agency drives causal reversal with on-page cost in "protesting... plucked string." Cost unmistakable in sacrificed comfort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial victory emerges organically from chess backstory, stasis as guilt pause, and final village breathing with labyrinth solved—resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Particulars like frayed threads reweight premise of pausing the "game."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: strategic pattern-spotting in weave as chess. Prose texture in syntax like "coiled, calculated, and ready to strike" modulates with intensity. No elision or head-hopping; diction fits tutor's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences like "He pulled the thread" advance action cleanly. Rhythm varies (short punchy climax vs. descriptive opener); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak "resistance snapped" beat. Zero artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess logic unravels wish-born time-freeze via tapestry code, transforming stasis trope through tutor's guilt and productive fidget. Risky magic-weave puzzle feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
