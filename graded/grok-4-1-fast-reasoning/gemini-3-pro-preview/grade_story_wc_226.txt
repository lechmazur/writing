<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's defiant artistry compels higher-stakes poetry amid known punishment risk, with embodied mischief (swinging legs, grinning) revealing contradictory playfulness and intention; final hop-down renunciation earns closure cost via prior motivation. Internal conflict acts in-scene through deliberate soft tenor defying echo rules.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry refracts into whispers, tightening density to spire's glow and shattered hush as CR with Kaelen's felt exile cost; orientation anchors early in canyon/spire. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain choices by amplifying singular emotion usually, enabling Kaelen's prism defiance; mist/spire charges final image of devoured judgment. Sensory hierarchy (acoustic weight, swirling mist) filters via his artistic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prism truth vs. singular guilt) signaled early, escalates via poetry's thousand whispers narrowing Elders' narrative; agency in his cadence forces trade-off, with punishment cost charging younger members' listening image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-shards emerges organically from echoes' choir and final "soil...true forgiveness," reweighting Elders' premise without statement; resonant non-literal answer in spire's overwhelm ties to Kaelen's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (artistic syncopation noticing "prism"); rhythmic prose modulates to cacophony, diction poetic yet concrete; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in poetry pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in climax whispers risks overwrite without obscuring cause/effect; no loops or scaffolds, propulsion strong to final image. Opening "forged hush" anchors voice propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic world-rules and poetry-prism transforms tropes; bone-ossuary originality inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in echo-refraction heightening stakes to charged closure.</comment>
