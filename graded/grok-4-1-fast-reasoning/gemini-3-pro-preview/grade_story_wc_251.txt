<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to foster hesitation is rooted in his telepathic gift and intensifies compellingly to the king-cradling signal. Interiority feels concrete and particular through mental "static noise" detection. Children remain collective without individual pressure, slightly limiting relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from setup to city-wide mental fracture; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with the heard "jagged questions" and released king reconfiguring obedience. Orientation anchors early (Elias in library by para 1). One tightening via signal suffices, cost legible in rebellion risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's lodestones constrain surveillance evasion, charging the signal beat; mist bookends as evolving mirror to confusion. Sensory details (metallic air, dust-moted skylight) filter through Elias's perceptual bias. Micro-setting (stone table, boards) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (induce hesitation via displays) signals early, tightens accumulatively to synchronized reveal narrowing options. Agency in cradling king forecloses compliance path; cost felt in "virus of hesitation" disrupting flow, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hesitation's beauty emerges organically from chess stalemates to city "traffic jam of intellect." Final image of "beautiful confusion" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting certainty's tyranny. Subtext in encoded notation and mental quiet avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (thoughts as "church bells," "static noise"); voice modulates rhythmically from setup density to climax poise. No dialogue, so n/a; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports accumulative drive, but figurative overload ("blue bruise," "forests of second thoughts") in opening risks coherence without full pattern payoff. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to closure image. Minor overwrite slightly dulls peak signal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Chess-as-rebellion premise freshly synthesizes telepathy, displays, and mental disruption into inevitable city repricing. Window synchronization turn feels earned from early notation encoding. Bold risk in visual uprising heightens stakes organically.</comment>
