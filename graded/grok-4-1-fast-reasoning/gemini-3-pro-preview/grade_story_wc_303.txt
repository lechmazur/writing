<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in hesitation against plant encouragement, compelling the seed placement with embodied mulberry ache resolving to relief; final choice earned by telepathic pressure and flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with coffee reading revealing "perforated destiny" gaps that motivate seed act, delivering DC closure in violin shattering; legible cost in irrevocable provenance change and dawn deadline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy's psychic screams and violin's biting cold constrain the climax seed placement; recurring frost vs humid growth mirrors internal wild-vs-frozen stakes, charging final vine image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant dream-vs-empire stake tightens causally via coffee's "hole in destiny" and ivy's "act now before dawn" urgency, forcing agency in propagation; cost felt in treasonous transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of messy life overtaking sterile empire emerges organically from plant chaos vs violin silence, answered resonantly in "green shoots twisted to mimic the violin’s curves" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of plant "green ambition" roar and coffee dregs; rhythmic prose modulates from chaotic noise to silent eruption under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, coherent metaphors like "roots drove...into the ice, drinking the ancient water"; propulsion peaks flawlessly in "seed split...erupted" without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, coffee divination, and ice violin propagation transforms empire-vs-nature trope; risk in poetic "moth-eaten" destiny pays off at charged closure.</comment>
