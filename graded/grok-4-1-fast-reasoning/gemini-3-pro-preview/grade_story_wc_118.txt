<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's odd historian traits and motivation to collect wall stories drive consistent actions like tracing rivets and probing artifacts, with embodied perceptions of echoes revealing character under pressure. Minimal internal contradiction limits depth, but fulfillment carries felt cost in duty completed. Strong single-POV execution fits scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sensing panic to tapestry realization, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where silo relaxes after truth extraction—cost legible in "eternal, dreamless vigil." Single scene, orientation anchored early, one tightening via diary revelations suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Silo's rust gantries, slanted floor, and rivets constrain climbing and charge perceptions; recurring "bronze quiet" and hearth evolve to mirror unburdening, reweighting final image. Sensory hierarchy (metallic resonance, cold spikes) filters through Elian's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe past trauma) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via deepening discoveries (panic → diaries → dragons' meaning) narrows knowledge, agency in extraction/reading forces reconfiguration with world's insomnia as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of dream-loss emerges organically from axis shift, wall echoes, and tapestry memorial; final CR reweights dragons from myth to magnetic failure without moralizing, resonating via charged poise in silo's release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as history); rhythmic diction modulates from heavy quiet to relaxing silence, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere without loops; rhythm varies (long atmospheric opens to sharp revelations), minor figurative density in opening ("iron lung," "bronze quiet") purposeful and un-muddled. Propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tapestry as ley-line map weaves myth into post-axis science, transforming dream-death into wall-retained psychic residue; risk in perceptual communion heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from particulars.</comment>
