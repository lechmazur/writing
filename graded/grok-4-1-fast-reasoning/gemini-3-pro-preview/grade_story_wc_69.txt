<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to braid voices is rooted in consistent traits like traveled stillness and desperation, compelling micro-choices like silent conducting. Interiority concrete via embodied resignation ("face expectantly resigned"). Final endurance earned by prior buildup, with visible cost in unchanged sorrow after harmony breaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: subtraction builds from city hum to primal hum to chord. Orientation anchored early (Elian by window in Velvet Library). Charged Poise closure on-page ("the focus broke... echo died"), cost legible in "sorrow of a guardian watching the last light flicker out."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Velvet Library and autumn leaves vivid/selective, mirroring vanishing ("dust of the season"). Rosette as micro-setting constrains conducting ("peering through... denote the invisible intersection") and charges finale ("trembled... amplifying the ghost"). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward acoustics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmony before resonance fades) signaled early, textural escalation via subtraction narrows isolation options to convergence. Agency in urging suppression forces trade-off. Cost unmistakable when "chair scraped... mundane noise rushed back," charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing resonance emerges from subtraction to chord, subtext in rosette's "ghost." Final image ("leaves fall... waiting for winter") non-literally reweights premise with conceptual cost of obsolescence, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (acoustic stillness). Prose texture distinct in rhythmic swells ("vibrating potential... braided together"). Whisper dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via "Do not add... by subtracting noise."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring buildup (short suppression beats to swelling clauses). No loops; rhythm read-aloud natural. Minor figurative density in opener ("curtains... drank the light") purposeful, not muddling peak chord.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: choir teacher uses rosette relic for noise subtraction to force harmony in apathetic era. Ingenuity in physics of empathy ("hums... bending toward one another"); transforms vanishing arts trope without hedging.</comment>
