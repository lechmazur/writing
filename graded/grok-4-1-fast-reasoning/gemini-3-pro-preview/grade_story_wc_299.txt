<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's ex-roadie traits shine in the brute-force wresting of the frame, clashing with appraiser delicacy to reveal internal conflict and compel the verification choice. Facts-as-armor method embodies doubt and intensifies to the earned realization. Minor slip: final epiphany borders tidy without deeper contradiction in the pocketed-scrap beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory dread and doubt build to CR closure in "the silence didn't frighten him," reweighting the premise with emotional cost legible in the phantom cheers ignored for threads. One tightening via wresting narrows verification options. Orientation anchored early in quarry/trailer; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Trailer's water-damaged pile and humidity fuse constrain the wresting choice, while quarry silence charges the final image as echo valley longing. Sensory hierarchy (smell assault, dusty light on threads) filters through Elias's priorities. Body/tool (hands on rotting wood) mirrors internal struggle without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem via authentic find amid doubt) signaled early, tightens via wresting that risks destroying the scrap and forces trade-off between delicacy and brute need. Internal pressure coheres under Accumulative lens to stance crystallization with felt humiliation cost. Kellen adds minor external nudge without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stewarding faded noise emerges organically from failure-livestream to artifact pocket, with final image resonating as non-literal answer to purpose after applause. Subtext in silence-swallowing void and thread verification avoids moralizing. Recurring silence motif reweights without token repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in fact-listing diction ("luan mahogany plywood") biasing toward objective data under stress. Voice modulates rhythm in peak wresting grunt echoing roadie past. Kellen's grunted dialogue distinguishes idiom naturally, advancing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "screamed and splintered" advancing action, sound, and release. Varied rhythm propels from dread whispers to realization cadence; no loops or scaffolds. Minor mixed metaphors (silence as "gaping, hungry thing") purposeful without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie-appraiser arc in quarry scavenging transforms antiques trope via Hendrix cloth specificity and brute verification turn. Risk in voice-blending fact catalogs with poetic silence earns inevitability at pocketed-history beat.</comment>
