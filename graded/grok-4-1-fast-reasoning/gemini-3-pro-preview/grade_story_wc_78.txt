<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent traits drive motivation to transform storm, shown in calculated strikes; embodied emotions peak in heaving chest and bone-resonating bass. Final endurance earned via escalating micro-choices around trunk. No unearned epiphanies; flaws in rigid resistance philosophy balanced by genuine exertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cloud interpretation to fractal strikes, yielding Charged Poise closure in naming "Overture of the Apple Moon" with exertion cost legible in "chest heaving." Single scene oriented early at Driftwood Orchard. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Driftwood Orchard constrains choices (grafting bonds threaten snap, timber dampens waves); selective sensory (ozone taste, bruised plum water) filters through Elara's prophetic bias. Great Trunk as micro-setting anchors strikes, charges final warm bark touch. Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard survival) signaled early, escalates via density increase in sonic lattice meeting squall; agency in adaptive strikes narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in spray-lashed face and unified leaf shiver. Final naming crystallizes stance with felt physical price.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of obstacles-as-instruments emerges organically from strikes-to-symphony progression; final image of washed bark and indifferent ocean reweights premise non-literally with endurance cost. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in ocean's vastness. Recurring sonic motifs constrain without checklist feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing ("wind... dissonant shriek," "bowed string against the cello"). Rhythmic control modulates from whispers to throbbing bass under storm stress. No head-hopping; elisions purposeful in visualized geometry.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-task (e.g., "mallet connected, a visible vibration rippled" advances action/atmosphere). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle in peak strikes. Zero loops or scaffolds; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fractals and driftwood ecology transforms storm tropes; fractal generating feels inevitable from cloud geometry. Risky conceit (xylophone vs. gale) heightens stakes organically. No derivatives; singular vision commits to premise implications.</comment>
