<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like trembling hands inspecting stains and waiting for echo fade, reveal internal conflict between polite caricatures and jagged inspiration. Mnemonic gift motivates but leans tell over on-page constraint, slightly unearned in peak drawing beat. Final transformation from "machine" to "conduit" feels earned with visible cost of buried pain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from memory grief to lock destruction to spectral installation, culminating in Charged Poise RR where pulsating light reconfigures identity with foundational pain as cost—legible in "light pulsate through the drawing with a rhythm that matched his own beating heart." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via brass shatter suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal cave's phosphorescent violets/blues and acoustic echoes constrain timing and frame choices, charging final image via quartz hollow. Sensory hierarchy (visual bleed, echo fade, charcoal rasp) mirrors grief through artist's priorities. No white-room; lived-in via stone smash resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate voice) signaled early, deepens texturally via agency in lock destruction narrowing to install method, foreclosing polite life with cost of pain-as-foundation felt in final pulse. Coherent pressure to Charged Poise; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pain-forged beauty emerges organically via shards-under-art image reweighting suppression to conduit promise, without moralizing. Final non-literal answer resonates in "no longer a machine... conduit for the subterranean dark," charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in charcoal-stained extensions of darkness and spectral definition; rhythmic control modulates melancholy to pregnant silence. Prose texture distinct, biased to artist's eye on "jagged lines and deep, velvety shadows."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; vivid rhythm varies (short shatter crack to heaving chest). Minor overwrite in opening "auroral sorrow" density purposeful for tone, not muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic curse, cave ritual, and lock-shards-under-art transforms artist-trope into inevitable liberation; risk in subterranean peril heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
