<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stoic grace vs. volcanic tenderness) act in scene, culminating in the charcoal act that earns closure with emotional cost; interiority concrete via soot-stained finger and chest tightness. Attribute and backstory anchor choices without labels dominating. Solo POV flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clue density (statue, tapestry, portrait) tightens to CR closure where reinterpreting red smears as flames reconfigures promise with felt tenderness cost; on-page in "the archive around her seemed to exhale." Orientation anchored early in substructure/archive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains (ventilation shaft climb) and charges final image (archive exhales); sensory hierarchy (geo-thermal heat, brittle fabric) via POV bias filters raw history. Rotunda silence crushes bone, mirroring internal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) deepens accumulatively to portrait act narrowing interpretive options; agency in shading forces trade-off (not restore face, but recontextualize) with legible emotional cost in chest tightness. One tightening sufficient, coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (fire as truthful speech vs. loaned lies) emerges organically via portrait shift to flames, reweighting premise without moral; final image resonates as non-literal answer to shared rage. Particulars (charcoal repurposed) build complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (emotional logic linking objects); diction/rhythm (sweeping strokes) modulates intensity. No head-hopping; voice biased to intuitive deconstruction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (every line advances intuition/pressure); rhythm varies (short stoic sentences to sweeping closure); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (geological vein of gold to flames). Propulsion peaks in "speaking in fire."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist's intuitive trail through archive art reinterprets self-vandalism as fiery speech; risk in recontextualizing chaos heightens closure stakes organically. Non-obvious premise transformed via specifics.</comment>
