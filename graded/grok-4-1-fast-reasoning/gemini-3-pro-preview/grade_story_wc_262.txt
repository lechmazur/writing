<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied actions like warming the strip; spatial imagination particularizes interiority without stock phrasing. Final success earned via prior micro-choices, foreclosing the strip's energy with felt depletion. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak process slightly tempers from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from touch to transfer, culminating in CR (love suspended in lens nebula) with legible conceptual cost ("fly in amber," world exhales). Orientation anchored early; single scene causality tight, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Projection booth and lens constrain choices (no threading to avoid burn, lens as vessel); sensory details (ozone, acetate, thunder rattle) selective via POV bias, mirroring internal pressure. Booth's geometry unfolds via trait, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early; Accum lens escalation via density surge (thunder sympathy, energy hum, pillars of regret). Tightening at transfer forecloses strip's potential, cost felt in inert celluloid and suspended nebula.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserved-but-trapped love emerges via particulars (pooled pauses, halide ghosts); final lens nebula reweights premise non-literally, resonant without moralizing. Counter-reading (relief vs. stasis) lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (extruding 3D from flat, invisible weights); rhythmic modulation matches intensity, diction biased to sensory imagination. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete images; metaphors coherent (dying leaf, viscous potential), no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in sustained lyricism ("hushed thunder" reprise purposeful but borders repetition) nicks peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, film emulsion, and love-as-energy transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in spatial lyricism inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
