<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in trade skills and desperation compels micro-choices like whispering truth to flare the stone, embodying doubt via trembling palm. Contradictory impulses peak when steeling against dimming chip, earning the insertion. Minor abstraction in "singular and desperate" softens embodiment slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from hesitant gears to shockwave harmonics, with on-page DC closure as shard insertion halts rust ("shockwave... halting the creeping corrosion"). Orientation anchors in first paragraph; persistent constraint of wilting chip shapes tactics. Cost legible in forced belief against doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance Chamber constrains via scratching doors and hesitant gears, charging final reversal of oxidation on walls. Tools like loupe and tweezers filter through repairman POV, evolving tactilely. Recurring chip glow mirrors internal purity, recharging climax image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair city's lung vs. rust) tightens via counterintuitive method narrowing options, escalating to tether risk of shattering. Agency in ignoring fractures forces trade-off, with insertion as peak under Accumulative lens. Felt cost in doubt's threat to dim stone charges reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of affirmation denying decay emerges organically from mending pristine gears, culminating in non-literal final image: rust slides off as machine remembers perfection. Subtext in stone's judgment reweights honesty vs. entropy without moralizing. Charged reprise of light as "audible clarity" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with repairman perceptual bias (microscopic topography, brass pins). Voice modulates rhythmically from hesitant to triumphant fugue. Whispered "I am a mender" carries subtext, natural under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chip singing... neared the spinning assembly" advances action, sound, stakes). Varied rhythm supports propulsion; figurative density like "choir of metal birds" purposeful but borders overwrites in climax beat. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: metaphysical rust corroding reality countered by truth-judging stone and counterintuitive mending transforms tropes organically. Risky method ("mending what isn't torn") heightens stakes inevitably to miracle. No derivative echoes.</comment>
