<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's meticulous traits drive micro-choices like precise sorting and trembling prod, embodied in "breath held tight"; interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning competent over conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush wind die → leaf spiral → monument build → prod triggers RR closure in sapling growth with felt anticipatory cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, pattern tightens density to miraculous unfurl.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor's soft damp moss and ash constrain ritual (shelf fungus trays, humus circle), charge final image as "ash like snow"; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (mossy delight), selective via sorter's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode leaf for sowing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through tribute demand narrowing to prod under ritual pressure; cost legible in lonely seed and trembling finger, agency in monument build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of past-future bridge emerges organically via leaf message to transformed sapling; final image reweights ash from grim to "snow on warm home" without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with perceptual signature (mossy delight, jeweler precision); rhythmic prose modulates to hushed intensity in prod moment, diction nature-infused without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels (icicle crack sound-image does triple duty); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, figurative controlled ("spiraling upward"); peak beat clarity in unfurl unimpeded.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-arbor ritual transforms folklore tropes via moonstone-seed fusion; risk in microscopic monument inevitability charges closure, no derivative echoes.</comment>
