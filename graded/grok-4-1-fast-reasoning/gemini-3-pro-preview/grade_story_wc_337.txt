<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in trembling hands proceeding despite guilt, earning the final touch on the mask's cheek as Earned Stasis with personal cost. Interiority particular via heart as "war drum," embodied under silence's weight. Flaw of theft compounds via brother's spirit, driving micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds as knots unravel, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) where hush threads into fissure, reconfiguring scream to placid emptiness with legible cost in "his own unrest would never settle." Orientation anchored early in prism sanctuary. Persistent net constraint shapes tactics to closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism walls and starlight dissect sky, constraining perception as air heavies and light freezes, charging final "cage of light and quiet." Sensory hierarchy (visual shards, tactile pressure) POV-specific to restorer. Micro-tools (needle, net) evolve tactilely, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirit pre-escape) signaled early, escalates via density (scream chokes under exhumed hush), driven by agency in needle twists narrowing options. Cost unmistakable in mask's "violently" profound silence vs. Elian's enduring unrest. Lens-compliant tightening at final knot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Guilt-silencing theme emerges organically from theft and brother's spirit, resonant CR in final touch reweighting "stolen peace" without moral. Subtext in "invisible syrup" pooling, inviting ambiguity of grounded dead vs. living prisoner. Particulars (net's drownings) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: metaphysical bias ("psychic shriek," "soundless pressure") biased to restorer's trade. Rhythmic control modulates to compressed flashes under stress ("needle flashing like... fish"). Diction purposeful, lyric without elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "air grew noticeably heavier, pressing against his chest" advances plot/atmosphere/embodiment). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (syrup hush, deleted sound) taught early, payoff at closure without muddle. Propulsion peaks in "final, desperate twist."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of mask-spirits, silence-exhuming net transforms tropes into inevitable hush-threading climax. Bold metaphysical logic (nets trap ocean quiet) risks pay off in charged closure. Fresh angle on grief via stolen grave artifact.</comment>
