<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via scrutiny of butterflies and trembling fingers under ghost's pressure; contradictory assumption of orderly grief versus tangled revelation acts in scene, earning carving choice with embodied cost. Final hand-steadying confirms change via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in ribbon's knot realization and carving start; cost legible in "trembling fingers" and "permanence of a chisel strike." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; one tightening via moth measurement suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse, ladder, and glass panes constrain choices like climbing/measuring; butterflies as recurring micro-setting charge final image of departure mirroring lesson. Sensory details (damp earth, pulsing rust) filter through Elias's priorities, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to etch collective grief signaled early, tightens via agency in retracing moth path under meditative pressure; cost felt in chaotic loops foreclosing orderly assumption, charging carving under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief as woven knot emerges organically from poem rhythm, ribbon tangle, and vines carving; final image reweights prior orderly premise without moralizing, resonant via departing butterflies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in insect scrutiny and meditative breath-labor; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, distinct texture in syntax like "thundering calm" persists under stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm and integrated figuration; no loops or scaffolds, purposeful overwriting like "breathing rust" enhances without muddling peak revelation in ribbon twist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost mentorship via silk ribbon and butterfly migration transforms trope into inevitable knot revelation; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes, original in gravestone-carver's sacred geometry pursuit.</comment>
