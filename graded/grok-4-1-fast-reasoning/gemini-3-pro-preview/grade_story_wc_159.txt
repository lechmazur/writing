<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to preserve names drives all micro-choices, embodied in trembling fingers and chest tightening at repair's success. Interiority particular via foxglove regret, balancing competence with isolation's cost. Earned stasis in resuming patrol forecloses abandonment without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: diagnosis → repair → revival tightens density to Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elian in Opal Library above clouds). Cost legible in "heavy satisfaction... vacuum of endless sky," reconfiguring isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal library's acoustics constrain repair (hum matches frequency), charging final silent footsteps on opal floor. Sensory hierarchy (sound over visual) reflects caretaker bias. Details evolve causally: dissonance bleeds, wind revives harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchid/names preservation) signaled early, tightens via sonic repair narrowing failure option. Agency in humming echo forces trade-off with regret. Cost felt in isolation persisting post-revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of futile preservation emerges from particulars: gray petals to indigo, names suspended for absent listeners. Final image (names falling like rain) offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting duty's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sonic/light metaphors (petals flicker dull gray). Voice modulates rhythmically: short repair sentences accelerate tension. No head-hopping; diction matches solitary caretaker's lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload (e.g., "friction of sound began to light the fracture") risks coherence in peak repair beat, dulling momentum slightly. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally. Clean mechanics support read-aloud ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic memory-preservation in floating library transforms isolation trope via irreplaceable glass orchids. Risky lyric acoustics heighten stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: chime mends enable ending's conceptual poise.</comment>
