<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in Elias's repulsive allure and steady confession despite trembling hands; final vulnerability earned by prior resistance to fear. Advisor applies peripheral pressure without diluting single-POV focus. Minor limitation: Advisor lacks full crucible interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: paradoxical notes lead to mirror confrontation, confession triggers implosion as DC/CR with burning clasp cost legible in "searing hot in Elias’s hand." Orientation anchored immediately at entrance. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse constrains navigation via warped paths and luminance-revealed solidity; mirror charges climax as void reflection. Sensory selectivity (wet sawdust, neon trails) mirrors post-resuscitation distortion. Environment evolves causally to "empty ruin."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trick fear escalates via agency-driven paradox-following to confession, narrowing options with searing clasp cost. One tightening sufficient under causal lens. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance at mirror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of apathy starving fear emerges organically from confession inverting instinct; final image of imploding mirror reweights premise without moralizing. Dictionary marginalia subtly accumulates resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in luminance trails and Advisor periphery; voice modulates rhythmically from churning pulse to quiet ruin. Advisor dialogue carries distinct dry-leaf idiom and subtextual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("words tearing out... like jagged stones"); rhythm varies without loops or muddle, even in peak confession. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-death luminance quest and paradoxical dictionary trap transforms funhouse tropes; confession as fear's "lethal bait" feels inevitable and risky.</comment>
