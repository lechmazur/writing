<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from photo selection to vine-climb cadence; resonant reconfiguration lands in ruins-to-sculpture image with lingering cost legible in "hours" stood and cooling air.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ruins and lavender constrain alignment and evolve causally via vines into charged final sculpture; scents and glow mirror internal repair without overt symbolism.</comment>
