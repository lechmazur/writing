<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation deeply personal and consistent, shown through choice of flawed puppet and final breath; interiority concrete in thumb-tracing crack and forehead against pane. Embodied emotions like "bruised awe" layer without labels. Final endurance earned by prior calibration, with cost of self-dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to resonant humming and pattern explosion as RR/CR closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Silas, lighthouse, role). Cost legible in "his own form losing coherence" and lighthouse unspooling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pane of hush and puppet crack constrain choices, charging final shatter image. Sensory hierarchy vivid (visual spectrum, tactile fissure, mute colors). Setting evolves causally from dusk to night, mirroring stakes without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmit lullaby) signaled early, escalates via dial adjustments and resonance under accumulative lens, narrowing to transmission. Agency in tracing fractal edges forces trade-off; cost visible in puppet dissolution and self-unspooling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of flawed kindness seeding void emerges from puppet topography and emotion spectrum, reweighted in final "darkness... no longer empty." Resonance from particulars avoids morals; invitation to reflect on persistence via CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in surreal filters like "screams of dying stars into... colors." Rhythmic control modulates to fluid humming; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (fractal edges refracting emotion) without muddle in peak transmission. Varied rhythm, no loops; "nested patterns exploded outward" propels closure cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of doomsday custodian whispering lullaby via shattered toy transforms tropes; puppet's asymmetry inevitably seeds kindness glitch, risking surreal conceit that heightens cosmic stakes.</comment>
