<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in serene smile amid "lethal drop mere inches from her toes," compelling trance-risk with embodied optimism; final endurance earned by prior motivation and micro-choices in loops, foreclosing fatalism at cost of collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sleepwalking density builds mesh, yielding Resonant Reconfiguration closure in "stitched scar proving... precedents broken," with felt physical cost in collapse; oriented early, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and slick stone constrain acrobatics, charging final "suspended floor of silver and stone"; orchid solace enables trance, mirroring internal revision with sensory evolution from humid peace to dawn wind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake against decay tightens via overlapping paths' "ghostly efficiency," narrowing options with lethal risk; agency in trance-sewing drives deepening under Accumulative lens, cost legible in groaning stone and collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ruin-to-reverence emerges organically from sewing fissure, resonant in final "tapestry... devoted weaver" reweighting elders' fatalism without moralizing; particulars like plate and scar anchor complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "mender of the geography itself"; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive hush to kinetic "needle flashed," heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory integration, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "petrify upon contact" purposeful, clarity peaks in "overlapping paths... suspended floor."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sleep-sewing canyons transforms ruin-rebellion trope into fresh synthesis of engineering-faith; bold trance-acrobatics risks heighten stakes, inevitable in "scar proving precedents broken."</comment>
