<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's adaptation via emotional mapping compels screw offering amid Kael's doubt, earning relational shift; contradictory loss drives choices without therapy-speak overload. Minor stock phrasing in "aromatherapist with no nose" edges from higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: anxiety buildup to screw test tightens, yielding Charged Poise closure in steady rhythm and nod with felt cost of Elias's sensory loss. Orientation anchored early; decisive reconfiguration legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and reservoirs distort perception, constraining emotional read and charging final occluded clarity; water drip recurs, mirroring internal states via tactile humidity and sound. Sensory bias via lost smell elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix clock via humanized legacy) deepens accumulatively through skepticism reversal, narrowing to success with emotional labor cost; agency in screw placement forces trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Adaptation reweights loss through screw's life-to-time bridge, final silence inhaling "damp silence" resonating ordinary miracles without moralizing. Particulars yield thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases to visual/emotional cues; dialogue subtextual ("Scrap metal?" vs. "Legacy") advances with distinct idiom. Rhythmic modulation under calm pressure coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (fog pressing, heartbeat rhythm) without muddle. Minor modifier stacks in opening but no loops or scaffold dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Midwife screw ingeniously bridges birth/flow to clock repair, transforming obsolescence trope via sensory loss; quiet synthesis risks bold perceptual shift, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
