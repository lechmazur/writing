<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's molt from Weeper to Architect concretely embodies motivation, compelling rebuild choices with prior paralysis cost; friendship crucible forces efficient rhythm. Minor diagnostic labels like "The Architect has arrived" slightly abstract internal conflict without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from decay to planting; CR closure in moonlight over dormant seeds reconfigures rebellion options with conceptual subtlety-vs-noise cost legible in "slow explosion...no law could arrest."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rotunda fissures and debris constrain seed placement tactics; moonlight evolution charges final image, mirroring internal shift from rot to silver-veined potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of garden rebellion signaled early tightens via personality-enabled planting under moon timing, narrowing to subtle poise vs. expected riots; cost felt in foreclosed noisy paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blooming resistance theme emerges organically via ink-seeds and vines; final cracks-under-moon image resonantly reweights anarchy-to-beauty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with poetic perceptual bias ("luminous fracture") sustains texture; dialogue subtext distinguishes voices and advances stake efficiently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; coherent metaphors like "violet bruise" and "veins of silver" avoid muddle, no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Molting poet's seed rebellion synthesizes post-apoc tropes into fresh, inevitable blooming CR; risk of lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
