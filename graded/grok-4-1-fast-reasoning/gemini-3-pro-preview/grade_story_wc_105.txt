<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong obsessive motivation rooted in synesthesia drives all choices, embodied in steady hands amid "cacophony of light." Interiority concrete and particular, with no other characters to dilute. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+; completion feels earned but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure at "The imprint was complete," reweighting creation with exhaustion cost legible in final lean-back. Single scene oriented early ("Sunken Orchard," ocean floor). No orientation debt; lens holds cleanly without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora's "spectral light" and shipwrecks constrain via contrast to lush greenhouse, charging final image of "silent judgment." Sensory hierarchy synesthetic and selective, mirroring internal states through action (drones, Forge). Micro-setting (Ashen Forge) evolves, charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imprint in mitosis window) signaled early, tightens via "frantic" pacing and cell shudder, foreclosing delay option under Accumulative lens. Agency in Forge activation; cost felt in exhaustion and "grim harvest." Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility, but no reversal narrows further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of betrayal's sonic absence emerges organically from drone silences to "ghost in the machine," resonant without statement. Final image ("silent judgment of the sunken ships") reweights premise non-literally. Complexity in moral ambiguity of "battered marvel"; no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("aurora...sang to her in minor keys"); diction/rhythm modulates pressure purposefully. No head-hopping or elision issues; voice distinct and biased. Prose as character reflects obsessive mind.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in aurora repetitions ("shimmered...sang...flared") risks density penalty in build to imprint. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to closure. Figurative strain ("bruised lung") coherent but heavy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, bio-engineering betrayal detector from shipwreck voids transforms tropes boldly. Premise fresh; "snapping cable in a vacuum" turn inevitable from particulars. Risk in underwater forge heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
