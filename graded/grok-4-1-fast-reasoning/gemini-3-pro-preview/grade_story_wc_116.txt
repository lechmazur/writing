<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to witness change roots consistently in loose grip on reality, earning final renunciation as keeper; embodied arthritis vanishing enables swan manipulation without contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to CR closure ("keeper of the quiet that follows the end of stories"); origami creases as geography provide legible transition and felt cost of library's end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library moss and river vibrations constrain move and charge final image; "shafts of grey light to cultivate the thick moss carpet" anchors vividly through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rising damp escalates stake to origami agency, narrowing options under textural lens; cost of archive collapse crystallizes in mind's eye view from refuge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights judgment-free observation into eternal quiet, resonating initial premise without moralizing; acceptance emerges organically from decay particulars.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in swan burrowing ("sliding between the microscopic layers of pulp and ink"); varied rhythm propels without loops or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Origami as spatial reshape via folds synthesizes fresh frame; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes of passive witnessing without gimmickry.</comment>
