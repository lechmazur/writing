<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the climax as artistic desperation clashes with survival tether, earning the renunciation when he pulls his hand away; embodied sensations like heart stutter ground interiority without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single-scene build to Earned Stasis closure—"Slowly, deliberately, he pulled his hand away"—with legible cost of "pain of limitation"; orientation anchored early in canyon descent, one tightening via rope smoking narrows options seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's clay layers constrain the pivotal scraping choice and charge the final "weeping wall" image; sensory details like viscous air and pulsing earth evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of accessing time's texture escalates accumulatively through deepening disturbances (rope unraveling, existence collapsing), forcing agency in renunciation with unmistakable cost at "choosing the pain of limitation."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as "friction of resisting it" emerges organically from rope's bite and pattern's destruction, reweighting the premise in final image of "composing a new line about the beauty of the unfinished" without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poetic voice with perceptual signature shines in lines like "silk dragged over gravel," modulating rhythm from playful whispers to somber realization; stable single-POV with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops, but minor figurative density in high-pressure climax ("granular, rushing fabric") slightly risks overwriting coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-alien time-pools accessed via poet's ritual transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in textural premise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via rope's reweighting.</comment>
