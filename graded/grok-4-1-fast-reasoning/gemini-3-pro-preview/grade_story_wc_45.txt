<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dr. Thorne's contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism versus yearning for magic—act simultaneously in the tooth discovery and tool choice, earning the final reframing choice with visible cost to clinical certainty. Interiority concrete via "texture of polished driftwood" and embodied stress in trembling leaves. No safety-hedging; flaws like shrewd innocence drive inevitable engagement with the fae theft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from body inspection to metaphorical splint, culminating in CR closure where mother's "dawn of understanding" reweights grief as hope with conceptual cost of embracing impossibility. Orientation anchored early in maze/garden/body find. Single scene coherent, one tightening via tooth as bridge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's fog, moss bed, and rustling maze constrain choices (holds breath, signals parents) and charge final image of hope "stretch[ing] beyond the garden walls." Sensory hierarchy medical/POV-specific: driftwood texture over visuals. Atmosphere tensions mundane grief with magical precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframe substitution to map vs. declare death) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tooth deepening options, forcing agency in unorthodox procedure. Cost legible in "painful but necessary alignment" of beliefs, charging closure. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of blending science/magic emerges organically from bone-setting metaphor and tooth-as-star, with final image offering resonant non-literal answer: cleft seals into "terrifying, beautiful hope" reweighting fae theft. Subtext in forgiveness via creature's "desperate observation"; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: medical metaphors like "compound break in a tibia" bias noticing. Voice texture distinct in rhythmic, modulated syntax reflecting innovation under pressure. Whispered "We do not discard the broken" advances goal subtly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm suits accumulative build, no loops despite "cleft" motif (purposeful). Minor figurative density ("mistakes into constellations") in peak beats taught early but borders overwrites without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: changeling as "shrewdly innocent" driftwood effigy treated via bone-setting reframes folklore through medical lens, with tooth turning tragedy to "navigational chart." Risky metaphor integration inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
