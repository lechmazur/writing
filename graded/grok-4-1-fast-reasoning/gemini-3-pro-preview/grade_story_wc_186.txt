<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Solitary obsession rooted in retrocognition drives micro-choices like superimposing ghost hands over her own at climax, earning validation with embodied weeping cost; no unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from hummed frustration to silence vacuum, delivering resonant reconfiguration closure when starlight purifies through hush; orientation anchored in first paragraph, cost legible in "before the silence collapsed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass floor ruins, rust-gears, and grime-dome constrain alignment choices and charge final beam image; sensory hierarchy (teeth-vibration to ear-pop) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove pattern) tightens via prism hush enabling alignment under accumulative lens, with agency in cranking against rust and felt cost in straining vacuum; one deepening suffices, charging fragile hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Coincidence vs. entropy theme emerges organically from prism find to light's announcement, reweighted non-literally by "thistle-blown hope" final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature bleeds past vividly into present (e.g., engineers' sweat on railing); rhythmic control modulates from hum-density to silence poise, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from ladder climb to beam eruption; no loops or artifacts, figurative language purposeful in climax "lance of pure, white brilliance."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, hush shard, and star geometry transforms post-apoc tropes; risk in metaphysical silence pays off inevitably at alignment, heightening fragile hope stakes.</comment>
