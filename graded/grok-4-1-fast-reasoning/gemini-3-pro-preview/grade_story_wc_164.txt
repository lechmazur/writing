<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in morbid curiosity, embodied in clapping at despair and mocking hope while projecting it; contradictory impulses peak in the conjecture beat, earning the final realization with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from seeds to glass projection to gaps, landing CR closure ("They hadn't died; they had just become background noise") with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Iridescent cave and sea-foam constrain choices (bubbles pop under timeframe pressure, quartz wall halts arrow) and charge final image of trapped souls in vibrations; selective sensory details mirror cheerful gloom perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover vanished paths) tightens via gaps requiring risky conjecture under Accumulative lens, with agency in projecting hope foreclosing logic-only path; cost legible in fading bubbles and giddy melancholy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of exquisite endings emerges organically from light gaps to voluntary inhabitation of paths, reweighting premise in CR without moralizing; final humming dirge resonates as non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "rainy funeral... loved the sandwiches") biases toward tragic delight; stable close third-person limited modulates rhythm with pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via multi-job lines (e.g., glass hum "rattled her teeth"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; purposeful figurative texture taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-to-light relic and civilization-as-vibrations transforms discovery tropes; risk in cheerful-gloom tone heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via conjecture turn.</comment>
