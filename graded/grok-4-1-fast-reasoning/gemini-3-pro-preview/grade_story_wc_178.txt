<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frugal traits embodied in torch-extinguishing and saved chalk compel ritual choices with ironic devotion as contradiction acting in scene. Final nod earns stasis with visible parsimony cost. No safety-hedging flaws; skepticism drives competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from corridor to ritual climax with on-page Charged Poise closure as lights lock in stasis. Covenant seals with felt cost of regime change below. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian floor and brass astrolabes constrain chalk diagrams and mirror ritual vectors, charging final darkness image. Sensory hierarchy via POV bias (efficiency over terror) vivid and selective. Babylonian specificity plausible, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal knowledge) signaled early tightens via diagram-to-rift progression under Accumulative lens, narrowing to offer tile with regime pressure. Agency in tapping tile forecloses path with ozone-scent cost. Escalation decisive without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Empirical irony emerges organically from skeptic's math-ritual, final star-order image reweights premise non-literally vs. shouts below. Resonance from particulars avoids morals; ambiguity lingers in preserved ether.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of parsimonious precision; diction/rhythm modulate to humming resonance peak. Elevated syntax reflects POV lexicon without drift. No head-hopping; elision absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density ("peeled back like parchment") borders overwriting in climax (-0.3). No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs anchor schematics humming to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Non-obvious magic-square covenant in Babylon transforms tropes via empirical ritual; risk in dusky math-mysticism heightens stakes. Synthesis inevitable in hindsight, fresh historical angle coherent without hedging.</comment>
