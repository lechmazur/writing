<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Junkyard prophet's precognitively forgetful flaw drives contradictory impulses (vision strikes, then erodes into "tidal longing"), forcing marker ritual; final endurance earned with embodied cost of crumbling chalk gripped at crater.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as fading vision density tightens to driftwood markers guiding to crater; CR closure ("content to let the future fade") lands with conceptual cost of signal loss, vision erosion waived as functional disorientation charging ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog and VHS stacks constrain navigation ("stepping where the driftwood pointed") and charge CR image of "quiet disintegration"; sensory hush and hum mirror internal haze without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to capture aging's sound deepens via agency in marker arrangement amid eroding vision, foreclosing recall path; entropy cost unmistakable in "collective sigh... turning into white noise."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory's entropy emerges from particulars (fog-softened debris, decaying tapes); final image non-literally reweights prophecy as inevitable haze without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third POV stable with prophetic perceptual signature ("phantom gallery," "vibration felt in the marrow"); rhythmic modulation heightens textural pressure to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to CR; metaphors (mist "curated," signal "dissolve") cohere without muddle in peak crater beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise of forgetful seer seeking aging's hum in Fog Sculpture Garden transforms decay tropes via junkyard monuments; lyric risk in textural drive inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
