<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in treasonous reawakening of beauty intensifies via embodied pulse-syncing and gap-between-knowing dread; micro-choices like setting the shell reveal values. Minor slip in archetypal rebel phrasing ("paved over its own soul") but impulses contradict in climax realization of scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibration density builds to pattern-break groan, landing DC/RR closure with legible cost in "city was broken, bleeding green and gold." Single scene anchors early; shell fall recharges as conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (acrid wind, mint/ozone scent, thudding footsteps) filters through violinist's priorities; statues/orchard constrain evasion tactic. Final "green and gold from its gray wounds" charges image as micro-setting payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken orchard) signaled early; escalation via falter-twitch-uproot density under lens driven by her agency in heart-sync playing. Cost unmistakable in heaving chest and order's violent destruction foreclosing stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free emerges organically from shell, vibration, uprising; final image of shell in "verdant chaos" non-literally reweights mechanical suppression without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pulse-feel and vibration-memory; rhythmic prose modulates to soft hum then groan without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative "curdled into tarnished wonder" purposeful without muddle in peak uproot beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin-heart rhythms bypassing golem sensors transforms eco-rebellion trope; shell-uproot risks bold premise payoff in alive-city reconfiguration.</comment>
