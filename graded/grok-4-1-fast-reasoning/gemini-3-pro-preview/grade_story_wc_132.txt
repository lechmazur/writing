<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the shift from frantic reconstruction ("force the answers out of nature") to surrender ("let the linden leaf fall"), earned by embodied symptoms like locking joints, with visible cost in lost humanity. Interiority particular via scientific detachment cloaking panic. No diagnostic slips; flaws drive inevitable struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: symptom density builds to cadence shift at "opened his hand and let the linden leaf fall," delivering Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of expanded awareness over human identity. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse during storm; single transition clear. Closure cost legible in final growth image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and rain-soaked ivy constrain surrender choice, cradling "hardening spine" to charge final image. Sensory details (rattling glass, hyper-oxygen air forcing exit) filter through Elias's bias, evolving with events. Body-as-setting (absorbing rain) mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse calcification) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed grip ("hands refused to make a fist") narrowing to renunciation. Agency in release forecloses resistance path with felt cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of observer-to-participant emerges organically from particulars, resonating in final "rain not as a sound, but as a sensation of growth" reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in circuitous sincerity layers complexity. Earned via struggle, invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: scientific idiom ("xylem took over his veins") biases noticing, modulating under stress to honest whisper. Rhythmic control heightens surrender beat. Voice distinct and embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels: varied syntax breathes with intensity, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent (bark-like patches, sap rising), integrated into action. Minor density in opening descriptions doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plant-hybrid vector transforms metamorphosis trope via specific genetic grafting irony, fresh in circuitous voice. Surrender turn inevitable from symptoms; bold risk in positive vegetal reframing heightens stakes organically.</comment>
