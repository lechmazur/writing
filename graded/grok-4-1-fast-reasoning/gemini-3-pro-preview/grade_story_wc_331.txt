<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied actions like pinching fabric into saddle shapes, revealing contradictory impulses of mania and precision; final endurance after scarf snap earns change with visible cost. Minor slip in told "sanely eccentric" label slightly abstracts motivation before full show.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from setup to shimmer/vision/snap; CR closure in "the attempt had validated her sanity" reconfigures options with conceptual cost of partial access, scarf constraint persistent. Orientation anchors early in library/3am details; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring scarf and desk constrain folding choice and charge final smoothing image; sensory hierarchy (ozone tang replacing paper scent) mirrors internal shift. Vivid micro-setting like "double-helix frescoes" filters through Elara's physics-metaphor bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access narrative source) signaled early, tightens via shimmer-to-vision deepening under Accumulative lens, forcing renunciation with snap's cost legible in collapsed void. Protagonist agency in pleating drives escalation; young man's gaze adds subtle external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stories' analog origins emerges organically from scarf's "residual heat" bleeding memories to final "inches away from the screaming source," reweighting digital limits without statement. Resonance in patrons' pause invites ambiguity on sanity vs. creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "metaphors were a form of physics" biases noticing; stable close third-person modulates rhythm with pressure (jerky folds). No dialogue to judge; purposeful compression in hyperbolic folds taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, from humming quiet to "shadows...defied light sources"; high density in "warp and weft" integrates action/sensory. Minor figurative density in peak vision risks slight muddle but coheres via voice without loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry on scarf for story-source portal transforms familiar eccentricity into non-obvious synthesis, inevitable in hindsight; risk in non-Euclidean folds heightens stakes organically. Final image recharges premise boldly without gimmick.</comment>
