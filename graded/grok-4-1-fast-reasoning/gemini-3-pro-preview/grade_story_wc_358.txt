<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prevent future crashes roots in consistent traits and intensifies via the patch discovery, grounding abstract physics in human loss. Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied actions like planting anemometers and climbing. Limited internal contradiction or flaws acting simultaneously caps higher score, though micro-choices reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: data beats accumulate to CR closure where convergence realization reweights hazards with conceptual cost ("turning hindsight into survival"). Orientation anchored early in Stacks/port. Tightening at patch find and logging forges one meaningful deepening; cost legible in "ghosts of the air currents."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting as towering Stacks labyrinth vividly constrains choices (wind shear forces precise anemometer placement, ladder climb). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (aerodynamic volatility noted professionally). Fog/environment charges final image of swirling ghosts; recurring containers mirror internal realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map hazards for rescue drones) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sensor data to convergence insight, narrowing future nav options. Patch beat deepens with human cost felt on-page. Agency in survey forecloses ignorance path; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-traps yielding foresight emerges organically from particulars (Stacks' accidental geology, patch as human anchor). Final image offers resonant CR repricing ("city breathed and how it killed") without moralizing. Subtext in silence vs. data's "song of warning" invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (precision amid haze, e.g., "hazy precision" in movements). Voice texture distinct via rhythmic prose modulating with intensity. No head-hopping; diction POV-plausible (aerodynamics idiom).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion; high density integrates sensory/action (e.g., "creaking metal sound like labored breathing"). Minor overwriting in wind metaphors ("invisible river," "predatory vortices") slightly muddles peak survey beat without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of derelict port Stacks as dynamic wind-trap labyrinth transforms crash trope via aerodynamic specificity. Convergence premise non-obvious, grown from particulars; risk in hazy, post-silent tone heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
