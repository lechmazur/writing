<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's gently persistent trait shown concretely in patient oversight of runs and ritual declaration; interiority embodied via scarf adjustment and bell tracing under wind stress. Secondary runners apply light pressure via risked delivery. Minor telling in motivation summary slightly dulls peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from camp silence to ritual peak, yielding Charged Poise closure in final image ("wind...sounded like a song of endurance"; bell weight as duty cost). Orientation anchored early (Elara on ridge, valley camp, sanctions). One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor constrains stealth and vantage ("shadows...scanning the darkness"); moonlight on bell charges final pocket image. Sensory selectivity sharpens urgency (biting wind, rustling leaves mirror amplified quiet). POV bias filters via leadership priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breach blockade via runs for solidarity) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via runner arrival and ritual declaration narrows to endurance choice with felt vigilance cost. Agency in organizing/declaring forecloses dependency path. No reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of solidarity via anonymity emerges implicitly from distribution strategy and ritual; final bell pocket/reconfigured wind offers resonant non-literal answer to sanctions' divisive intent. Particulars (grain crates, youth/elders bond) avoid platitudes; counter-reading (theft as sacrament) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (leadership focus on silhouettes, engravings); rhythmic control modulates from calm scan to resonant murmur. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("We feed the roots"). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "whisper could move mountains" advances tone/stakes); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density ("logistical ballet", "weaving bonds") purposeful but borders overwrite in reflective blocks without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Anonymity tactic transforms resistance trope into intergenerational sacrament; fresh ritual sanctifies theft via bell. Risky quiet endurance amid drones feels organic. Bell continuity links loss/reclamation non-obviously.</comment>
