<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's rejection of neural links and embodied struggle (gasping on summit, gritting teeth at pack whine) root motivation in flawed humanity, compelling the unstrapping and slotting with earned cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via system-branded "underachiever" enduring physical toll for raw mana. Final renunciation of safety forecloses automated path, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ascent density builds to keystone sigh and city stutter as CR, reweighting machine efficiency with human cost on page ("Looms stuttered... hum of the wind"). Orientation anchored early (Needle, city below). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt; persistent altitude constraint shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains choices (mist walking toll, rime-jagged gap) and charges final image (arch glow stabilizes against gale). Sensory hierarchy (biting wind, freezing breath, brilliant dimness) reflects mage bias. Environment evolves causally (pack slides to abyss), satisfying 9+ test without white-room or checklist sins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reject automation for human magic) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via stamina drain and pack protest, narrowing to slotting despite "logic dictated" impossibility. Agency in unstrapping forecloses safety with felt cost (shivering unburdened). City stutter crystallizes stance under lens; cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Human flaw vs. machine perfection emerges organically from keystone warmth ("soul-imprint machines could never replicate") and final mana flow ("slow, deliberate... terrifyingly human"). Resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing, satisfying 9+ test. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: mage filters city as "efficiency curves" vs. spire's "visual silence that screamed." Rhythmic control modulates (short gasps at rematerialization, flowing restoration). No head-hopping or filter excess; diction fits lexicon, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "It did not click; it sighed"). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence ("brilliant dimness flared"). Zero scaffold in peak (keystone slot); opening/final lines recharge motifs, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cyber-magic looms vs. granite soul-imprint transforms tropes via specific altitude physics and "accommodates impossibilities." Risky quiet CR ("simply put a stone back") heightens stakes organically. No derivative hedging; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
