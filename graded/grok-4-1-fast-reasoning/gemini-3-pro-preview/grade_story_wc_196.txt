<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to magnify kindnesses drives micro-choices like file interrogation and addendum; embodied ache softens via discovery, revealing character under pressure. Internal desperation vs. reverence acts in scene, earning final hopeful annotation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns accumulate to button's CR, reweighting abandonment with conceptual cost in preserved truth. Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via anomaly suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust stratigraphy as micro-setting constrains file choice and charges closure via preservation act. Sensory selection (fluorescent hum, grime voids) reflects archivist bias, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover kindness) signaled early, deepens via dust/button tightening options to lineage hypothesis. Felt cost in solemn duty forecloses bleak narrative, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Button/"Wait" offers resonant CR to abandonment theme, reweighting records via debris without moralizing. Emerges organically from dust-emotional currents, lingering paternal ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (dust as history); rhythmic modulation from reverent to charged poise. Prose texture distinct, elision purposeful in lyric observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops or artifacts dull image. Figurative integration (cardboard canyons) supports without muddle in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust forensics transforms orphan trope into fresh emotional archaeology; button promise inevitable from particulars. Bold synthesis of archive poetics heightens stakes organically.</comment>
