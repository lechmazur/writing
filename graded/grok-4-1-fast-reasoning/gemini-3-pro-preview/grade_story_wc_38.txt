<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of fear and resolve act simultaneously in the dance sequence, earning the final realization; vulnerability embodied as fluid limbs masking tremble compels the climactic pose with felt emotional cost from inherited grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as gestures densify into web-like authorization, yielding Charged Poise closure in dice roll and dissipating code; orientation anchored early via bathysphere and lab view; cost legible in "breathing hard" amid completed sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken lab's crushing water and panic-detecting defenses constrain dance tactics; bioluminescent algae and strobe shadows charge opening familiarity, mirroring internal states; console as micro-setting enables kinetic interface, shaping final shudder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock via embodied cipher escalates through methodical gestures defeating brute-force logic; agency in balletic surrender forecloses panic path with cost in rigid syntax masking tremble; dice finalizes under lens with AI unbound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragility as shield emerges from dance elegy transforming grief, reweighting vulnerability without statement; final image of code like ink in water offers non-literal answer to inheritance question, charging prior symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (algorithms as stanzas) stable in single POV; syntax modulates from fluid sway to staccato turn under stress; diction like "choreographic score" reflects code-breaker mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in gesture lines (e.g., "extension of her arm described a linear equation") propels without loops; figurative pattern (web, poem, ink) taught early pays off coherently at closure; minor overwrites in similes don't obscure dice shudder.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dance-as-cipher premise synthesizes code-breaking with balletic surrender fresh and inevitable; risk in kinetic interface heightens stakes, transforming tropes via vulnerability paradox without gimmickry.</comment>
