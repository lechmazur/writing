<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's tenderness toward the drone ("calloused fingers brushing... with the tenderness of a physician") embodies his heartfelt artisan trait under deadline pressure, earning his final satisfaction. Competence dominates without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, limiting to very strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: broken drone arrival → haptic refraction diagnosis → firmware patch → liftoff success, with tightening via escalating ship sounds. On-page Decisive Change at "wings blurred into a hum" lands closure with legible deadline cost in shifting skylight shadows. Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (wet iron smell, thrumming airship groan) pressures choices via depot sounds as live clock. Crystal basins and haptic pad constrain blind diagnosis, charging final air displacement feel. POV bias filters steampunk depot through artisan priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix drone for safe ascent) signaled early, tightens causally via engine roar narrowing time options. Elias's deliberate agency forecloses haste path with felt cost in "did not flinch... haste was the enemy." Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of perceiving machine souls amid chaos emerges organically via refraction "story of misalignment" decoded into flight. Final merging hums reconfigures man-machine harmony without moralizing. Minor abstraction in motivation phrase slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with blind perceptual signature (haptic textures, air displacement) biases noticing. Courier dialogue natural, rushed subtext advances stakes. Prose rhythm modulates calm amid rising roar without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm syncing with tension (short upload sentences amid roar). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; concrete images like "jagged spikes... smooth out" advance precisely. Minor stem similarity in diagnostic beats doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh blind haptic refraction via water innovates steampunk repair, synthesizing artisan soul-view with deadline causality. Hummingbird reprise transforms from frozen to blurring life, risking calm competence payoff that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
