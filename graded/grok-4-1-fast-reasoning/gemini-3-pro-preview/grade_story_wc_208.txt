<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" roots choices compellingly in her sculptor philosophy, earning the climax rigging; interiority embodied in turbine-hum trance and storm struggle. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "timewoven alliances" slightly abstracts peak realization without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore chain from radio plea to slide projection saving ship; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with legible physical cost in gale fight and adrenaline receding against generator.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and driftwood sculpture constrain choices (dragging against gale) and charge final image (generator housing); sensory hierarchy narrows to spray, hum, rain under crisis, filtered through sculptor's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save freighter from rocks) signaled early, tightens causally via rigging to projection success; agency in reimagining sculpture forecloses disaster path with embodied storm cost. One reversal in ship alignment suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of simplicity allying past tech emerges organically from slide projection bypassing electronics; final ship fade reconfigures premise non-literally with ancestor pact resonance. Avoids moralizing, lingering in timewoven ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable, perceptual signature sculptural (tides stripping rot); rhythmic prose modulates from frantic to reverie poise without filter excess or head-hopping. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; no loops, scaffolds, or metaphor muddle in peak beam activation. Minor overwriting in layered meanings phrasing slightly dulls one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Post-GPS world with driftwood-signal ingenuity transforms survival tropes via timewoven premise; fresh synthesis of antique slide in sculpture feels inevitable, risking bold arc without gimmick.</comment>
