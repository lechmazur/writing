<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation roots in consistent traits like surgical precision and poetic soul, compelling higher-stakes micro-choices like distorting the chord; interiority concrete via haunted frequencies sympathy. Final endurance of thankless task earned by prior acts, with conceptual cost legible. Contradictory impulses subtle in balancing facilitation without intrusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from intercept to dissonant chord shattering loop, yielding Charged Poise in pregnant silence and preparation; cost felt in "thankless task" and wiped glass rim. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in tunnel alcove. Single scene causality intact, no ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Subway tunnel constrains via heavy shadows and third-rail proximity, filtering perception; glass disc as micro-setting charges final image, enabling pitch-matching choice. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (vibrations over visuals). Details tactile, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (facilitating anonymous healing) signaled early, tightens via emotional loop deepening then dissonant break narrowing grief options; agency in thumb pressure forecloses circular sorrow with voices lighter. Cost unmistakable in severed connection before regret. Accumulative escalation coherent, one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cultivated estrangement emerges organically from no-names rule and wrong-number patch, reweighting anonymity as magic; final image of wiped rim offers resonant answer to pain's geometry without moralizing. Complexity in ghosts-over-strangers confession lingers plausibly. Theme inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in frequencies and wire hums biased to Silas's ear; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences in connection). Dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Is that you?"), advances via ghosts. No head-hopping, diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., disc spin harmonizes grief and voltage); rhythm varies, read-aloud ear clean. Minor overwriting in "bleeding underground arteries" but purposeful for tone, no muddle or loops touching closure. Zero scaffold, strong verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh premise of melodic switchboard operator transforms tropes via haunted frequencies and dissonance therapy; risk in surreal rules (residual heartbreaks) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at chord break. No derivatives, bold synthesis.</comment>
