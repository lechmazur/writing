<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in frantic tracing versus buckling surrender, earning the final vessel transformation with embodied cost of exhaustion. Interiority particular via ghostly whispers and skull-shattering noise. Minor abstraction in "profound sensitivity" phrasing, but actions align tightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density escalates from whispers to hurricane, pattern break via stillness reconfigures flow. Closure as RR/Charged Poise lands cleanly in "noise paradoxically clarified into music," with legible cost of paralysis. Orientation anchored early at apex/archway; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora, archway hum, frost constrain frantic work and final shadow image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to bone-shake and star-resonance under crisis. Body as micro-setting (veins pulsing stardust) charges climax and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) tightens via overload reversal, agency in surrender foreclosing pursuit with collapse cost. Accumulative escalation reweights options unmistakably in torrent vs. river flow. Moral calculus of dam-breaking vs. sanity visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unforced surrender emerges organically from frantic failure to vessel smile, reweighting active pursuit as obstacle. Final paralysis image answers central question resonantly without moralizing. Particulars like stardust rhythm avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of cosmic sensitivity ("swirling canvas," "flat circle"). Rhythm modulates from frantic to poised; diction purposeful without leakage. Elevated register fits moonstruck voice consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language coherent in peak ("hurricane of ideas threatening to shatter his skull") without muddling cause/effect. Propulsion aligns with frenzy-to-stasis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of cosmic pilgrimage and rest-as-action transforms madness trope. Star-Loom/archway premise feels inevitable, risking psychedelic intensity that heightens stakes. Bold voice commits fully without hedging.</comment>
