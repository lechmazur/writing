<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's scientifically romantic interiority and micro-choices under pressure (dipping grim persistence into shell) compel the climax revaluation with embodied cost (hollow chest). Kaelen's arrival and whisper force relational crucible. Minor abstract phrasing in motivation doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via setup to CR closure (pocket sun reweights time/friendship as finite, cost in hollow chest and "way back"). Orientation anchored early (precipice, Ember Nexus). Whisper as catalyst tightens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nautilus shell and Ember Nexus constrain choices (vortex follows geometry; energies hum to fever pitch) and charge final image (humming sphere above shell). Sensory hierarchy (heavy air, bruising purple) reflects alchemical urgency. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture density) signaled early; Kaelen's confession tightens via emotional catalyst, forcing revaluation trade-off with relational cost (departure forecloses endless time). Agency in using shock drives pocket sun under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of finite presence emerges from particulars (palette resolves, whisper stabilizes); final sphere offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing. Palette and shell shift meaning organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (photons as sand grains); dialogue subtextual ("I'm leaving" as vibration). Elevated diction fits alchemical voice; rhythm modulates to spare climax whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors (e.g., "cycle energy back upon itself") integrate without muddle in peak (whisper beat clean). Minor figurative density in setup doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and emotion (resolve as fluids binding calcium via whisper) feels inevitable; risk in abstract premise transformed through specific craft and closure image.</comment>
