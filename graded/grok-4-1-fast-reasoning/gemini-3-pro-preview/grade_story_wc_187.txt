<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied ache ("familiar ache in her chest") driving resolve; contradictory nostalgia yields earned renunciation of fears, silencing internal monologue before writing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure: shadow stops on "rune for solitude," reconfiguring psyche from expansion to preservation with conceptual cost of "long static dark."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt and obelisk shadows constrain method and charge final image; selective sensory weave (ozone, whispers) mirrors priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conjecturing future via shadows tightens accumulatively as projection "creep[s] across... entering the grim sector," forcing endurance with cost of "heavy burden" legible in writing beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as fragile window emerges organically from whispers fading and final fierce love for "last dynamic thing"; resonant CR reweights nostalgia without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (shadows as "refractive index"); rhythmic modulation peaks in charged hush, diction controlled and archivist-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action; minor density in "preemptively nostalgic... side effect" clause doesn't obscure, rhythm varies naturally to hushed close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of solid-fog world and shadow-divination transforms end-times trope; shadow's creep to solitude feels inevitable, risk in lyric texture heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
