<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (separation drive vs. affection surge in Garden) act simultaneously; final renunciation earned by chimeric interiority and card-vein realization, revealing values hierarchy with dormant potential cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to CR closure; "recapture unnecessary... pocketed the green card" reconfigures separation premise with legible cost of safe dormancy; narrative threads provide motivated linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emerald card as recurring micro-setting constrains path (beacon, resonates mold) and charges final image (pocketed vs. veins); verdant decay mirrors duality through goal-directed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (Garden separation) deepens texturally in atrium surge to renunciation; forecloses extraction path with acceptance cost felt in lighter step and permanent passenger image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final vein/card image offers non-literal answer to duality question, reweighting premise via "unkindled solace" without moralizing; emerges organically from chimeric struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with chimeric perceptual signature (phantom heartbeat, narrative speech); diction/rhythm modulate from destabilized fog to crystallized solace without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (rust flowers smelling salt/perfume) with propulsion; zero loops/scaffolds, rhythmic variety peaks at closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chimera twin on narrative-threaded carnival ship synthesizes surreal biology fresh; risk-taking in timeframe/memory alteration heightens stakes organically to CR without gimmickry.</comment>
