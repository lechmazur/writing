<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's weariness and stubbornness root motivation in concrete traits like forcing through ocean fissures, compelling the climax slotting; embodied fatigue culminates in slumping against dais. Internal conflict subtle in ghost tolerance despite sleep loss, but lacks simultaneous impulses acting in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: psychic clamor density builds to lens alignment and beam, delivering Charged Poise closure with cost in exhaustion and implied return trek ("He would have to walk back"). Orientation anchored by para 2; single scene tightens meaningfully at machine groan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater library constrains via cracked dome pressure and ghost currents, charging final image of "crushing quiet... pressing against the dome." Sensory hierarchy (bioluminescent glow, rotting shelves) reflects Silas's perceptual bias toward noise burial; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence via burial) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ghost clamor intensification to lens twist under lens; agency in slotting forecloses noise with cost in slump and journey wear. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of acknowledgment granting rest emerges organically from lens hum to beam silencing ghosts; final image reconfigures "chased stillness" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "distress signals only persist until... received."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in metaphysical gaps ("reality forgot to stitch"); rhythmic control modulates from heavy silence to beam eruption. No elision or head-hopping; diction biased to undertaker's finality ("closing a casket").</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action, image, interiority without loops; rhythm varies (short grunts amid long atmospheric builds). Minor figurative density ("whale dying in a cathedral") purposeful under textural lens, not muddling climax beam.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker burying metaphysical noise via lighthouse lens in psychic library transforms tropes; risk in impossible spaces heightens stakes organically. Ingenuity peaks in beam as "silent shout of confirmation," inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
