<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in spatial gifts and obsession compels the override choice with embodied tension in "trembling hand"; internal conflict between rigidity and release acts simultaneously. Earned change forecloses walls-for-safety path with conceptual cost. Minor slip: abstract epiphanies like "physics of letting go" border unearned without more contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: obsession → signal override → curtain opens as Decisive Change; cost legible in "surrendered control" and recalibrating space. Orientation anchored early in grow-op geometry. Single scene, one tightening via button press suffices; closure reconfigures worlds with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent pulse and spores constrain choice (filters defied) and charge final image of "spores dance in mixing currents." Sensory hierarchy via Elias's vectors; details integrated into action like air cycle rattling sheeting. No white-room; lived-in choreography tracks perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (invert boundaries to connect) signaled early, tightens causally via pointer override narrowing options; agency in press forecloses separation with felt cost of revolutionized protection. Pressure coheres without reversal need; moral calculus between safety and release sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rigid walls vs. breathing integration emerges from mycelial defiance and final image repricing separation as illusion; resonant non-literal answer in "erased edges of solitude." Complexity in fear's architecture lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with spatial perceptual signature ("vector map"); voice texture modulates from precise to pulsing rhythm under tension. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in lyric metaphors taught early, legible at release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene pulse; high density in integrated images like "microscopic spores drifted." Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("velvet-heavy hours," "quiet wildfire") in buildup but pattern supports lyric drive without obscuring closure; no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of security expertise and fungal permeability transforms letting-go trope; mushroom farm as breathing system inevitable in hindsight. Bold spatial obsession risks pay off in organic turns without gimmick.</comment>
