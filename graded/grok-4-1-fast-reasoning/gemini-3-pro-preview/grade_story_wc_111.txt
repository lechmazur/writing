<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's pragmatic motivation shines in repurposing marbles from fraud to tool, with embodied actions like cairn-building revealing stubborn intent over sub-prefect's pressure. Backstory anchors concretely to present ritual without flattening stakes. Final smile mirrors weathering, earning endurance with cost to metrics worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds ritual to CR closure: cracked marble refracts light, reviving leaf and stuttering gauge, reweighting luck premise with physics cost. Orientation anchored early in maze; single scene tightens via precise placement. No ambiguity; persistent constraint of fleeting light shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Helix Maze's "blooming withering" paradox scents and stone walls constrain light shaft, charging marble's final glow. Cracked marble as micro-setting filters POV botanically, mirroring internal states through tactile caress. Sensory hierarchy narrows to leaf's shiver under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—intent vs. metrics—tightens accumulatively as ritual counters sub-prefect's "total necrosis" prediction, narrowing to leaf's revival with gauge cost. Agency in polishing/placement forecloses stats path; moral calculus of penance vs. proof legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of utility in brokenness emerges via marble's fissure intensifying light, reweighting premise without statement; final line "broken tools cast the brightest light" resonates as CR image, not moral. Particulars like fermentation tang avoid platitudes, inviting ambiguity on luck's measure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable on Elian, perceptual signature in gnarled knuckles caressing wisteria; voice modulates rhythmically from heavy atmosphere to precise ritual. Dialogue subtextual—sub-prefect drones metrics, Elian silences with action; no head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory/action lines, e.g., "concentrated prism of brilliance... painted the dying leaf"; rhythm varies without loops, metaphors coherent (fissure catches beam). Minor overwriting in opening scents purposeful for tone, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck era with refraction physics transforms fraud trope into redemptive tool; risk in botanical-labyrinth specificity heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via ritual's angle calculation. No derivatives; conceptual integrity commits to soil-soul pact.</comment>
