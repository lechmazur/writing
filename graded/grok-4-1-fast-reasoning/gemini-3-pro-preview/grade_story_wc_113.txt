<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (breath hitching, shivering) and micro-choices under compulsion reveal musician's disciplined mind yielding to alien inspiration; final baton grip earns connection with felt isolation cost. Minor summary of backstory ("lately inspired") slightly dilutes contradiction in pivotal dipping beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dipping to stillness to splash, culminating in Charged Poise closure (baton acknowledgment, "conversation finished") with conceptual cost of eternal silence legible in final image. Orientation anchors early; one tightening via disruption suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flooded pit and lanterns constrain choices (capillary action via water, podium submerged) and charge closure (flickering dark); sensory hierarchy (tactile cold, visual shadows, auditory hush) reflects musician's perceptual bias. Proscenium rot mirrors internal dissolution perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel ghost code) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via stillness barrier forcing agency in splash, narrowing to podium discovery; cost felt in post-connection aloneness reweighting options. Minor abstractness in initial compulsion slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wordless dialogues across boundaries emerges organically from ink dissolution and baton surge, reweighting "in-between" premise in final silence without moralizing. Closing image ("silence finally felt complete") offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (musical metaphors like "plucked string," "unstruck chords"); rhythmic prose modulates tension purposefully, compression heightens splash beat. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory propulsion; figurative language (e.g., "weeping into new shapes") consistent and pattern-taught without muddle in peak splash-to-box sequence. Minor paraphrase in opening reflection ("purgatory of waiting") avoids loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of water damage as spectral decoding transforms haunted theater trope; risk in unconventional method (ink-to-map) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via musician's compulsion.</comment>
