<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in bridge failure versus vine swing, earning final renunciation of control with embodied tremble ("hands tremble"); interiority particular to tinkerer worldview throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: clock engravings therefore expedition, bridge shear therefore improvise, retrieval therefore CR realization ("stranded on a rock... pulsating exhilaration"); cost legible in final stranding image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vines and slick pillar constrain swing/jump choices; waterfall roar and "black water" charge final poise image, sensory hierarchy (rustle, decomposition, icy spray) POV-filtered via tinkerer's precision lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (retrieve compass) tightens via bridge failure narrowing mechanical options to chaotic jump; agency in improv earns cost of stranding, felt in "boots slammed... narrowly avoiding a slide."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of control-vs-chaos reweighted non-literally by compass spin and final "thrill of the unknown," emergent from vine success mirroring clock irony without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with tinkerer perceptual bias ("gears that refused to turn"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in jump ("gravity warred with the vegetation").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density weaves setting into action ("stepping over roots... until the roar"); varied rhythm propels without loops, minor figurative strain ("dry, rustling blizzard") contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse quest transforms artifact trope via clockwork irony and vine improv; non-obvious synthesis of precision-failure to fate-acceptance feels inevitable in compass hum.</comment>
