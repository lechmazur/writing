<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in feverish hands despite exhaustion compel assembly; final silent cupping of dying bird earns renunciation of hope with embodied sorrow, rooted in desperate traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to on-page CR: shell crumbles, bird chirps, then struggles—repricing flawed genesis with conceptual cost in "joy curdled" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stalactites weeping and palace swaying constrain focus amid shudders, mirroring internal suspension; egg armature as micro-setting charges hatching image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "hairline fracture appeared"); minor elevated diction in mutterings fits voice without muddle, propels to chirp echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk decay and organic resurrection transforms Frankenstein trope; hanging palace's quaking reverie risks bold lyricism, inevitable in tragic hatch.</comment>
