<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Phobia-ridden replicate's contradictory fears (agoraphobia vs. enclosed rust) drive embodied micro-choices like radar-scanning shadows, culminating in earned inversion that confronts flaws with cost in final terror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain tightens from betrayal to cast discovery to code inversion (DC) sealing Elias safe while exposing Julian; legible cost in "still terrified of the dark" reconfigures options on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains via tetanus/agoraphobia clash and supplies decisive cast; starlight enables decryption, charging final "safe, enclosed dark" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant survival/outwit stake signaled via 5-min clock; agency-driven tightening in decryption narrows to inversion trade-off with felt cost in sustained fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vulnerability-as-power emerges via fear-fueled decryption, resonating in non-literal final image where "fear had saved him while the hero’s bravery had left him exposed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual bias (hyper-vigilance on indentations) with rhythmic diction; Julian's tinny sneer carries subtext, but minor filter-verb stacks slightly dull peak immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("squeal of metal under his boots"); varied rhythm supports tension, though opening's stacked figures ("exposed iron ribs... freezing stars") border overwrought without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vat-grown phobia as superpower transforms replicate trope; child's cast outwit feels inevitable from arrogance blind spot, risking bold inversion payoff.</comment>
