<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in concrete traits like treating storm as "volatile orphan," compelling micro-choices; embodied stress (sweat stinging eyes) shows contradiction without therapy-speak. Final abstract drive "to find where broken promises heal" earns via prior risk endurance but borders on unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: pressure from drones/bottle/time coheres to Charged Poise closure (sliding bottle into chute reconfigures options with detonation risk as cost). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via absence-navigation suffices, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt Arcade's blue glass/shatterproof tiles constrain navigation and charge final image (kneeling on blue tiles); sensory hierarchy (electromagnetic hum, ozone taste) reflects courier bias, evolves with border cross.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver storm) signaled early, escalates via bottle rumble/drone gaps/time sync under Situational lens; agency in "threading a needle made of nothingness" forecloses paths with sweat/proximity cost visible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractures emerges from delivery particulars, resonates in final hush/thunder wait without statement; abstract motivation integrates obliquely via risk, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (storm as "encapsulated chaos"); rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences in drone cross) heightens pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "threading a needle made of nothingness" advances action/atmosphere); figurative language purposeful without muddle or loops, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bottled storm + absence-navigation transforms smuggling trope; "navigation by linking absences" feels inevitable, bold risk in conceptual weather cargo heightens stakes organically.</comment>
