<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is embodied and particular, with micro-choices like brushing the shadow revealing her surrender to the art; final realization earned through escalating sensory immersion without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from initial approach to feedback loop and CR closure ("tremor of certainty... separation had never been real"); cost legible in transgression's beauty, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade and shadows constrain immersion choices and charge final image of blurred realms; sensory details selective via POV, evolving causally with cloud and hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of entering the poem escalates via agency (stepping into shadows, paraphrasing chaos) under accumulative lens, tightening to tremor with legible cost of boundary dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of false separation emerges organically from sky-earth weaving, resonant CR in final atrium-as-vessel image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic biases (cloud texture via shadow); rhythmic modulation heightens immersion, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (shadows as ink/cats) supports lyric propulsion; minor paraphrase in process description but no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud-shadow poetry and resonant crystals transforms heresy trope into inevitable CR; risk in sensory dissolution heightens stakes organically.</comment>
