<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between wistful nostalgia and desperate action embodied in "trembling fingers" weaving rigid puzzle pieces; final sacrifice earned by escalating motivation, foreclosing life with felt cost in merging with loom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to closure DC (Elara's dissolution launches message); cost legible in "gears caught the energy of her life," reconfiguring options with persistent boundary constraint via puzzle edges.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bamboo "rattling cage" and orchard trees constrain tactics, erased on-page to charge final image of enduring message; sensory hierarchy (metallic taste of sacrifice) narrows under crisis, mirroring internal dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (send message) signaled early, escalates via silence breaching tree ("nearest apple tree flickered and simply ceased"); agency in sacrifice drives tightening under lens, with unmistakable life-cost in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries preserving memory emerges organically from puzzle edges holding against unraveling; final image ("message endured, sailing through the dark") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (nostalgic textural bias in "soil that tasted of lost years"); rhythmic control heightens pressure, diction modulates to compressed intensity at "Recommence."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful figurative layering taught early pays off without muddle; minor density overload in opening metaphors contained, propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom-as-raft with scavenged puzzle boundaries vs. erasing silence feels inevitable; bold risk in metaphorical physics (cardboard defying void) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
