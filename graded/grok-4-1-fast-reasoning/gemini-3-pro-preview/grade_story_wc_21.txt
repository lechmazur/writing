<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choices in rearranging debris from TRUTH/RELEASE to WITNESS reveal a hierarchy of values, earning the trade with embodied tears; solemn archivist traits anchor motivation without stereotypes, though interior conflict is more implied than simultaneous impulses in peak negotiation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds tightly: letters → descent → debris parley → cipher release with Decisive Change as figure dissolves and lagoon solidifies; cost legible in "weight of the diary now heavier," reconfiguring options on-page without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains voice ("psychic static... tearing spoken words") and charges closure ("lagoon solidified instantly"); heat distorts air and evaporates tears, mirroring psychic pressure through tactile embodiment in debris arrangement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cipher to topple regime) tightens via failed voice → debris TRUTH/RELEASE → agency trade-off to WITNESS, foreclosing simple extraction; causal lens escalation narrows options with felt emotional cost in tears, charging final extraction signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of negotiated witness across death emerges organically from debris glyphs and trade, reweighting legacy in final "story... loud enough to be heard" without moralizing; resonant image of solidified lagoon answers truth's cost non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (archivist attuned to "psychic resonance of a massacre"); rhythmic prose modulates from dirge hum to snapped tension, eliding spoken dialogue purposefully via distortion for lip-read payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in climax ("froze... stuttering into silence"); minor figurative density ("vibrating with a searing reverie") in setup doesn't obscure debris beat, but slight register elevation ("retrocognitively trapped") nudges from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive trap and debris-language parley transforms ghost-negotiation trope; risk in non-verbal climax via glyphs feels inevitable, heightening stakes through psychic-physical constraints without gimmickry.</comment>
