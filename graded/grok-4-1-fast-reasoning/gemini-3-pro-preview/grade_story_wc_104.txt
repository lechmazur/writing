<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in strategic endurance shines in decoding amid chaos, with embodied calm ("tension finally leaving his shoulders") earning the final stance; internal conflict sparse but traits consistent without stock phrasing. Shackle as flaw complicates yet reveals hierarchy of values in micro-choices. No contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain: mob roar → decode keys → insert arrow → vault seals as intruders arrive, delivering on-page Decisive Change; cost legible in "chain still held him fast" amid "spirit soared." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival vividly selective ("sun-bleached teddy bears," "lacquer-peeled upright piano") constrains choices via hidden props and shackle proximity; sensory hierarchy (sounds of mob/glass over visuals) reflects urgency. Environment charges final image as debris-strewn hall contrasts sealed vault below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal vault) signaled early, tightens via intruders' arrival forcing final torque; agency in decoding/arrow insertion forecloses mob access with Elias's likely death as felt cost. Pressure coheres causally without coincidence resolution; moral calculus (deny today for tomorrow) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice ("denying the mob a meal for today so that their children might eat tomorrow") emerges organically from seed vault protection and final dignity; resonant non-literal answer in chained-yet-soaring spirit reweights short-term chaos vs. long-term resilience. No moralizing; ambiguity in mob's future lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias (botanical code focus); voice texture distinct in rhythmic prose ("dust motes danced in shafts of light") modulating to calm intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; perceptual signature in strategic noticing of keys/arrow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "heavy, hydraulic hiss echoed from beneath" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors coherent and pattern-taught; propulsion clear to closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc guardian in carnival with botanical cipher and grain-fletched arrow feels inevitable; tropes (chained hero, vault) transformed via organic keys/piano disguise. Risk in Fibonacci code pays off at climax without gimmickry.</comment>
