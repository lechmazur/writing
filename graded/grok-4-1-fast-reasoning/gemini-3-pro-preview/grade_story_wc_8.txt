<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's clinical precision and empathy-without-hate ("did not hate him; she understood his fear") create contradictory impulses that earn her steady persuasion in the climax. Censor's white knuckles and sigh reveal pressure-aligned reactions. Minor slip: diagnostic self-awareness ("processed that fear as a variable") borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: petal drop → Elara crushes petal and advances → parallels persuade → Censor yields case (DC) with cost in final pruning image ("truth would hurt... only path to future growth"). Orientation anchored by para 2; single scene tightens once meaningfully. Persistent constraint: station's decay shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy and rosebush constrain climax argument ("your noble lie acts exactly like this ivy") and charge final image (leaves Censor with "naked, thorned stems"). Sensory hierarchy (iron/damp, oil-stained gravel) reflects Elara's precision; details evolve via her gestures. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture letter) signaled para 3, tightens causally via petal inciting speech reversal that narrows Censor's defense. Agency in hand extension forecloses lie's hold; cost legible in regime dismantle and societal pain. One escalation sufficient under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Noble lies emerge via Red Blight/ivy parallels, reweighted in CR: truth as "winter pruning" with cost in thorns/growth image, no moralizing. Subtext in silence after handover; complexity lingers without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elara's perceptual bias (cataloging sadness while calculating). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("noble lie... suture wounds"); distinct voices (Censor's hiss vs Elara's steady). Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "crushing the fallen petal" advances plot/character/atmosphere). Varied syntax/starts; no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in speech cadence. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: rose petal as armistice timer + ivy/lie parallel transforms noble-lie trope via station crucible. Risky quiet handover earns hindsight inevitability; no template echoes.</comment>
