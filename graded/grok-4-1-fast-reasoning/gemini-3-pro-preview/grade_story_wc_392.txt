<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's fortified vulnerability shines in contradictory impulses during the vision ("threatened to crack his professional armor") and final choice, earning the defiance with embodied tremor in hands not reaching voice. Backstory reflection anchors to present cues without flattening pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "fortified vulnerability" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scanner anomaly → lantern touch → vision/data → upload defiance as DC with career cost legible in "silence that followed... his own silence." Orientation anchors early (Elias in tunnel post-drought). Single scene fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tunnel's dripping humidity and infrasound constrain choices (rebreather, scanner amid rising water), charging final image of lantern as "sentinel in the dark." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (empirical scanner vs. psychic hum); water evolves causally with hum ripples. Micro-setting (lantern) mirrors internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. corporate leash) signaled early, tightens causally via vision/data narrowing options to defiance; agency in upload forecloses career path with felt cost in comms silence. Halloway's orders apply pressure; moral calculus peaks in "To obey... To disobey."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of refusing to "let drown" buried stories emerges organically from lantern/vision particulars, reweighting corporate narrative in final upload/image without statement. Past-present overlap creates resonant ambiguity; no moralizing, counter-readings in Halloway's indifference linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in empirical bias (scanner over intuition) amid psychic intrusion; diction modulates with intensity (short sentences in hum). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, Halloway's "Classify it" vs. Elias's steady reply shows status. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short hum sentences accelerate); metaphors purposeful ("lightning rod for trauma") without muddle in peaks. Minor scaffold in reflective block ("fortified vulnerability he lived with every day") but anchors to present. Clean grammar, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychic residue + Underground Railroad relic in modern tunnel transforms ghost-story trope via empirical scanner falsifying corporate cause. Risky quiet defiance heightens stakes; lantern reprise inevitable in hindsight, no derivative echoes.</comment>
