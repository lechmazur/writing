<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses excel in the buckle swap beat, where panic threatens but monk-like calm prevails through micro-choices like blocking Lyra's view; final duty-with-memory endurance earned by prior pressure. Interiority particularized via fingertip detection and muscle memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds impeccably: static clears → fracture found → inventive swap → successful deployment as DC with felt cost in "heavy memory of the risk remaining." Orientation anchored early in bio-dome arbor; single scene tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor's ivy-choked steel and frosted glass leaves constrain via belt clip resource and decaying orbit pressure, charging final turn-back image; sensory narrowing to tactile micro-fracture under crisis vivid and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lyra's safe drop) tightens decisively at fracture discovery, forcing buckle-swap agency that forecloses abort path with visible risk cost; causal escalation narrows options unerringly to charged poise in counting seconds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Watcher's burden theme emerges organically from particulars like hidden shaking hands, reweighted in final "soundless echo of her survival ringing" as resonant answer to trust-under-pressure question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeking gaze and tactile primacy; rhythmic compression peaks in repair ("fingers dancing through...locking pins"), modulating seamlessly under stress without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; propulsion via varied syntax accelerates repair beat ("He knelt, blocking...deftly unthreading"), metaphors coherent (e.g., "mountain root") without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orbital arbor skydiving and tactile engineering under silence transforms tropes; inventive buckle swap from muscle memory feels inevitable, heightened by soundless tone risks without gimmick.</comment>
