<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in white-knuckled grip versus shuddering breath; final drop earned through scar-link vibration, foreclosing anchor with felt terror of emptiness. Elian's gentle counters reveal distinct voice and pressure without dominance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from encroachment to ring drop as RR/Charged Poise, cost legible in "vast, terrifying open space" and empty palms. Orientation anchored early in burnt cathedral; single scene tightens meaningfully once.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ash coating like snow and starlight glow constrain via tactile ash (swallows thud) and mirror internal soot-liberation; recurring charcoal charges final shaky stand on blackened earth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ring as proof/anchor) signaled early, tightens via Elian's point to dissolving threshold narrowing options; agency in uncurled fingers pays cost unmistakably in encroaching fear vs. breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of severance-for-breath emerges implicitly via bridge demolition to empty palms; final image reweights premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity in "wide, dark world" without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases to shadows/ash; sparse dialogue subtextual ("hands back") advances via rustle/whisper rhythm matching tone, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "smoke caught in a draft" consistent/patterned, vary rhythm without loops; closure image propels via "dull, final thud that swallowed the sound instantly."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms escape trope via spectral scar-link in charcoal sanctuary; fresh synthesis of shadow empathy feels inevitable, risk in lyric poise heightens stakes legibly.</comment>
