<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in pyramid scheme scars drives the volunteer choice and trickster resolution; interiority concrete in "spark of being virtuously mischievous." Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+; resolve dominates without much hypocrisy shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: messages → recognition → volunteer → bolt placement → pressure snap → diamond DC with cost (bolt destroyed, Elias strain). Orientation anchored early in cavern/moss. Closure decisive on-page, constraint (mycelium center) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent pulsing constrains focal choice ("mycelium network thickest") and charges closure (mushrooms flare relief, altar diamond). Sensory vivid/POV-biased (ozone/petrichor tastes like hiding spot). Environment evolves causally with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (funnel quantum debt or ecosystem flattens) signaled early, tightens via agency (volunteer/channel to bolt) narrowing options. Cost legible in knees buckling/lungs burning and bolt erasure. Causal escalation forces trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing broken promises emerges organically from survivor arc and diamond payoff, reweighting pyramid schemes via final toss. Resonant CR in "made a pyramid scheme pay out" without moralizing. Particulars (bolt/debt) drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (shadowseam indigo stitching shadows). Rhythmic diction modulates pressure ("screaming in frustration"); glitchy texts distinct. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density/propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "pressure snapped... text messages stopped" advances closure). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (phantom ocean, gravitational pull). Ear-test passes fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of quantum promises/pyramid debt into physical crush/diamond feels inevitable; bold risk in conceptual physics transforms tropes. Irreplaceable premise commits fully, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
