<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in tattooist past compellingly drives feverish precision under overload threat; ink-stained fingers and stylus adaptation reveal particular skills. Contradictory impulses (terror vs. redemption) act in climax scene, earning final emotional lift. Guilt backstory anchors without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from boot sequence to warping cry, culminating in on-page Resonant Reconfiguration: amber glows, trapping cry as constellation with emotional cost of preservation over erasure. Orientation anchors early (Elara in lab, letters cue). One tightening via intensifying wail narrows options cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber as micro-setting constrains tether choice and charges final constellation image; lab's suspended silence and warping shadows mirror internal dissonance. Sensory details (vibrating hum, shuddering insect) filter through Elara's tactile priorities. No white-room; purposeful economy integrates into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt via cry-translation) signaled early, tightens via overload threat forcing agency in stylus work; cost legible in tears and system-shatter risk. Accumulative pressure coheres to cadence shift at chime. One deepening (visceral cry recognition) alters knowledge without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation over erasure emerges organically from cry-to-constellation shift, reweighting premise in final amber image without moralizing. Tattooist mapping echoes particulars to subtext of fixed light points. Resonance invites ambiguity on redemption's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (mapping cries like galaxies) and rhythmic modulation under stress; poetic diction ("code that wept") purposeful and consistent. Whispered "Stay with me" carries goal subtext. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete images (e.g., "drawing lines between the chaotic spikes"); metaphors cohere without muddle in climax. Minor figurative density in peak beat taught early, pays off in closure glow. Zero loops or scaffolds obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooist redeeming guilt via cry-to-star firmware transforms tropes organically; risky lyric compression heightens stakes. Amber-constellation reweighting feels inevitable from setup. Bold premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
