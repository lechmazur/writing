<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory nerves ("logistics of human connection terrified him" vs. "cautious exuberance") and micro-choices (hesitation to approach) earn the final relational shift with embodied cost. Librarian feels particular through guarded-to-radiant arc, revealed via reaction to locket. Minor slip: overt labeling of motives ("specific motivation was to uplift") borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mistaken envelope → inquiries → approach → delivery → invitation to sit as Charged Poise closure, with legible cost in Elias's vulnerability ("out of his comfort zone"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (who/where/when). One tightening via her gasp narrows to connection; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ocean wind on pages, mosaic floor echo) filter through Elias's broker gaze (container rust pattern analogy), guiding his approach. Breezy library under stars charges final teak chairs image, subtly mirroring openness. Spatial choreography clear; no white-room or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (accurate delivery to spark connection) signaled early, tightens via her guarded reaction forcing his explanation, with agency in initiation and cost in exposed nerves. Causal lens escalation coheres to Charged Poise; live option (nonchalance mask) foreclosed. Minor abstractness in stakes scale keeps from 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges organically from Elias's ledger-balancing act and final "kindness was the only currency that truly appreciated," reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image (strangers bridged by heirloom) offers non-literal resonance to question of human connection. Subtext in silences and shrugs layers complexity; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (broker's "whimsically attentive" gaze on twitch/rust). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("accurate delivery is the only thing that matters"), advances plot via indirection. Rhythmic control modulates tension to closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy approaches vs. breathing descriptions), strong verbs propel to closure without loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("heavy quiet," "salt-laced air") clusters but doesn't obscure cause/effect. Clean mechanics; no filter stacks or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of broker precision applied to kindness return transforms "lost heirloom" trope via envelope mechanics and cosmic ledger. Risk in quiet relational poise heightens emotional stakes organically. Minor proximity to sentimental reunion tales limits to 8s.</comment>
