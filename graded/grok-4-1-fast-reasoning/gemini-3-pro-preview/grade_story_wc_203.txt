<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent traits like ghost-seeing and observance compel precise extraction under intensifying spectral pressure, with actions revealing hierarchy of values; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from dust diagnosis to mainspring extraction and winding key priming delivers on-page Decisive Change via lift descent, with building groan and ghost fade as legible cost; anchors who/where/when by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust ripples and plaster cracks as micro-setting constrain diagnosis choice and charge final widening/descent image; sensory selection (heaviness, groan) reflects POV urgency and circus decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to reveal ceiling tightens via jammed pilot discovery narrowing to surgical plier extraction, with spirits' intensification as pressure and building shift as cost under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Facade cracks and jammed timer evoke trapped cycles/illusions, resonating non-literally in ghost release and "descending truth" without moralizing; reweights premise via image shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in spectral "weightless burden" and dust patterns; rhythmic modulation builds to closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and specifics like "concentric ripples"; zero loops, coherent metaphors, and ear-tested rhythm accelerate to groan without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ghost-seeing tech's dust forensics on circus lift with horologist jam transforms supernatural repair trope into inevitable causal synthesis; risk of hydraulic reveal heightens without gimmick.</comment>
