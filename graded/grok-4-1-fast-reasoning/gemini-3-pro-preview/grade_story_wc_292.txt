<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in ancestor honor compel the climax choice, with terror vs certainty acting simultaneously; tears at ship's lights show earned reconfiguration. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "nervously confident" slightly abstracts a pivotal early beat without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly through density buildup to CR closure: ship's outline reweights lost/found premise with legible emotional cost in final tears/condensation image. Orientation anchored early on gangway; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (ozone/wet wool, spongey moss) filters through Elara's scholarly terror, constraining actions like gloved journal consult; recurring moss quivers at hum, charging final cloud-bleed image. Environment as micro-setting guides ritual without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove ancestor's discovery) signaled early, tightens via accumulative pressure to question's cadence shift narrowing exile reversal options; agency in nail placement/speech forecloses doubt with tears as felt cost. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mapping unmappable emerges organically from particulars like ciphers-as-shanties and thin border realization, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Subtext in petitioning storm sovereignty lingers with ambiguity of persistent dread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (rot-textured atmosphere as character dread) modulates rhythm under stress; single spoken line natural/subtextual as decrypt key. No dialogue overload; diction biased to librarian's cipher lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("bruised, swollen flesh," "porous gloom") clusters at monitors flicker without pattern payoff dulls climax propulsion slightly; no loops or scaffolds touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual-tech exile reversal via shanty ciphers transforms storm trope through librarian's vow; ship's wink from void feels inevitable from nail/ritual setup. Bold cipher conceit risks but coheres without gimmick.</comment>
