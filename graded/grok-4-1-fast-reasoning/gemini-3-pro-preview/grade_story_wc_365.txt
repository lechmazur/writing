<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines in sensory-specific mapping ("metallic taste of fear") and embodied conflict during the trance fight; final endurance of truth's weight feels earned via prior causal strain, with contradictory impulses (seek truth vs. temporal drag) acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from rift onset to revelation; orientation anchors early (Elara in bay, rifts felt); CR closure lands cleanly in final image of bloodied shard and "immense, invisible weight," with legible conceptual cost of mercy-lie.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring shard and bay details (oil-stained floor, air pressure drop) constrain trance tactics and charge final bloodied image; sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency, narrowing to "marrow of one's bones" amid crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth via rifts) signaled early, escalates via one deepening (redirecting river-like flow narrows options); agency in mental grip shows trade-off cost (physical snap-risk, felt gasp), coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth's burden emerges organically from particulars (betrayal taste vs. necessity revelation); final CR reweights premise without moralizing, resonant in "lie had been a mercy" amid lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (emotional topography); rhythmic modulation heightens trance ("pushing through heavy curtains"); no elision or head-hopping, diction biased to sensory cartography.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., shard "vibrating with friction" advances plot/embodies strain); minor overwriting in metaphors ("turning a rushing river") during peak but purposeful and non-muddled; varied rhythm propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory multiverse navigation transforms truth-seeking trope; risk in lyric trance structure heightens emotional stakes, inevitable CR feels non-obvious via map-maker lens.</comment>
