<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, rooted in curiosity driving precise micro-choices like sextant mapping; embodied emotions via calloused hands and cheek smudge ground him concretely. Interiority particular without stock phrases, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal deconstruction beat. Final satisfaction earned by prior causality, with competence balanced by volatile sorrow's risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sludge density buildup, holds through causal sextant twist to shattering; orientation anchors who/where/when by para 2. Closure as on-page Decisive Change (sorrow vents) with Resonant Reconfiguration (hedge knit, tree hum), cost legible in "jagged tear" mended only by moonlight constraint. Pin-drop timing seals cost-proof test without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stormlit tower and labyrinth vivid/selective, moonlight recurring object constrains healing choice and charges final bark-touch image. Sensory hierarchy (thunder rattle to pin chime) narrows with crisis; hedges/oaks mirror internal melancholy via psychic mortar. Weather pressures timing in eye-of-storm vacuum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sorrow blockage bursting reality) signaled para 1, tightens via mapping dreams to keystone under Accumulative lens. Agency in deconstruction forecloses volatile shovel option with tear cost; escalation deepens to pin-moment reversal narrowing tactics. Protagonist-driven, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mundane miracles emerges organically from quantified emotion's deconstruction to tree-witness resonance, avoiding statement. Final oak vibration reweights curiosity premise with non-literal payoff (lovers/wars/rain secrets). Subtext in hedge wound mirrors emotional refuse without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (metaphysical grease, sap hum); diction/rhythm modulates from heavy storm to silent vacuum seamlessly. Prose texture distinct in syntax like "breathed, heavy exhalations," no head-hopping or withholding. Voice reflects Elias's quiet curiosity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., sextant "split the light" advances plot/sets stakes); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors coherent, not muddling climax twist. Propulsion peaks at pin-chime without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified sorrow, broken sextant dreaming, tree vigil transforms maintenance trope into inevitable mundane miracle. Risky magical logic (volatility, moonlight heal) heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, premise bold and particular.</comment>
