<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation to compress eternity rooted in traits drives all micro-choices; contradictory impulses (permanence vs fluid world) act in scene, final contentment earned with fall's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density to shattering CR/RR closure; frost-whisper-press chain reconfigures reality on-page with Silas's fall as legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass orchard and frost patterns constrain flaw-hunt choice and charge final shards-raining image; sensory details (hissing liquid, groaning press) evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant destabilization stake escalates accumulatively via press tightening; agency in lever-strain forecloses negotiable world with timeline-buckling cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Permanence vs fluidity emerges organically; final "unchangeable chapter" image resonantly reweights premise without moral, embracing destruction's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (frost as "fingerprints of old universe"); diction/rhythm modulate from curated calm to roaring chaos seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density propels via varied rhythm; metaphors like "bottled whisper" integrate without muddle in peak press-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal ink-vs-mutable-history synthesis feels inevitable; bold press-as-rupture risk heightens stakes, transforming tropes through lived mechanics.</comment>
