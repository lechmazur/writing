<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between clinical apathy and desperate empathy-seeking act vividly in the lake visions; final throw and weeping earned by procedure's causal buildup with embodied "hot and jagged" pang as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal-Accumulative lens holds: procedure causes journey (newspaper decoding), lake visions accumulate density to reprice timeline chaos, closure CR via ball throw with legible regret cost in "wept for the ghosts."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains climax visions and charges final throw image; jaded POV filters "dry, clinical appreciation," sensory details (swirling fractals) purposeful and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early, deepens via lake's branching paths narrowing to throw as agency-driven renunciation; cost unmistakable in chest pang foreclosing apathy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth theme emerges organically from visions reweighting procedure's linear numbness; final weep offers resonant non-literal answer to redemption without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with jaded perceptual signature ("museum curator inspecting a fake diamond"); rhythmic prose modulates from detachment to intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts; propulsion peaks in "gripped tightly, knuckles white" without overwriting, clarity sharp at closure throw.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neuro-scrub, time-traveler artifact, oracle lake transforms tropes; risk in fractal visions heightens stakes, feels inevitable at empathetic bloom.</comment>
