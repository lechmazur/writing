<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's quietly proactive trait drives concrete micro-choices like pruning and slow approach, earning the final shared silence; Mara's guarded vulnerability feels embodied in her shiver and clutch. Minor abstraction in poetic interiority slightly distances peak emotional contradiction from raw embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as mossy details and drip pattern build density to Charged Poise closure in final sitting image, reconfiguring silence from void to safe with her "shattered peace" as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in data center post-confession; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moss garden setting constrains via icicle drip guiding to pendant/terminal, charging final image; sensory details (wet stone, ozone) filtered through Elias's watchful perception evolve with thaw. Spatial choreography coherent, mirroring internal grafting without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting meaning amid Mara's hiding tightens accumulatively through pattern-led discovery and proffer, forcing endurance with visible cost in her trembling acceptance and foreclosed isolation. Quiet pressure coheres without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of growth over digital ruin emerges organically from moss devouring servers to final "grafting his quiet hope onto her shattered peace," reweighting confession's wounds without moralizing. Amber seed and thawing subtly recur to charge resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with distinct perceptual signature in "topographic maps of lichen bloom"; lush rhythm modulates from watchful tread to deepened hush without head-hopping or withholding. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; metaphors like "green velvet moss" cohere in accumulative pattern without muddle or loops, varying rhythm supports quiet peak. Final line recharges drip motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data ruin as moss nursery with amber seed pendant transforms post-viral trope; icicle pattern and grafting metaphor feel inevitable, risking poetic density for textured closure.</comment>
