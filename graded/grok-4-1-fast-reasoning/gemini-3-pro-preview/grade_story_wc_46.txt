<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in the trembling hand and saline inhale grounding panic, earning endurance of trauma through micro-choices. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously during memory surge, compelling higher-stakes persistence. Minor abstraction in "pearl of stillness" slightly distances embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via polishing-memory interweave to Charged Poise closure in final jewel glow reconfiguring trauma/light. Orientation anchors early in grotto navigation. Persistent craft constraint shapes tactics; cost legible in endured memory yielding balanced gem.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lapidary wheel and sea glass constrain choices (precise polishing, weighing) and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (damp twist to grinding drone) reflects Elara's priorities, mirroring internal shift. Grotto micro-setting evolves tactilely, guiding retreat from fog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fireless light post-trauma) signaled early; memory panic deepens via Accumulative cadence shift, narrowing to tender ministration. Agency in grounding inhale forecloses panic path with embodied cost. Trade-off in precision (scale quiver) charges end under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "cool tear... steady guide" offers resonant non-literal answer to trauma/premise, reweighting light-as-healing without moral. Theme emerges organically from glass transformation and memory contrast. Subtle ambiguity in celestial tether lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (celestial-oceanic diction) biased to star watcher's priorities. Rhythmic modulation peaks in memory roar contracting to zephyr bloom. Purposeful compression in polishing drone teaches pattern, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pressed a shard... strip away" advances action/atmosphere); syntax varies for propulsion. Figurative density in memory beat ("jagged maw... black smoke") borders overwrite (-0.4), but clarity holds without muddle. Zero loops; read-aloud rhythm natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma-alchemist crafting stellar lanterns from debris transforms fire trope via sea glass optics. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in memory-craft braid. Inevitable hindsight in "heavens down into the dark" from particulars.</comment>
