<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to teach dust stories drives precise micro-choices like transcribing and cloaking; embodied "thistled calm" reveals resilient interiority under threat without stock phrasing. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from transcription to glowing page and patrol swirl, landing Charged Poise closure as he guards the desk with felt detection cost; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember alcove's geothermal vents and mist constrain heat/light detection, charging final shadowed protection; dust flecks evolve tactilely, mirroring internal rebellion through POV-biased sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of subversive transmission tightens via glow's intensification and patrol signal under Accumulative lens; cloaking agency forecloses exposure with legible risk cost in final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of narrative infection emerges organically from dust absorption and decomposition; final "infection of wonder" image offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration of story famine without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in poetic, mist-choked diction and rhythmic modulation; purposeful compression teaches lyric pattern, paying off in charged final serenity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via layered sensory propulsion; figurative language purposeful in accumulative texture without muddle, though opening stacks slightly thicken non-peak rhythm—no loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dust-as-story-vector premise synthesizes heresy, physics, and wonder into inevitable infection image; bold risk in lyric world-logic transforms dystopia tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
