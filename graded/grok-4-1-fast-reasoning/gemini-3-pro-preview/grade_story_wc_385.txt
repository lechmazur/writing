<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in haunted loss of Archivist drives all choices, intensifying to final sealing with embodied tension ("shell grew hot"). Interiority concrete via perceptive distinctions (natural decay vs. magical binding), but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal moment. Micro-choices like pitch adjustments reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: progressive layers build density to CR closure where "tragic echo" seals into shell, reweighting echoes as "living monuments to their own murder" with felt cost in lighter canyon and her resolve. Orientation anchored early ("Elara stood alone where the sandstone walls twisted"). One tightening at deepest echo surfacing validates method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sound-focused via POV (dissonance in reverb hints betrayal); setting constrains via acoustic geometry matching shell spiral. Final image charges canyon shift mirroring internal burden transfer. Starlit nexus subtly guides patient melody-feeding over blunt force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Archivist's fate without detection) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via clearer echoes narrowing to grafting revelation. Agency in modulated whispers forecloses detection path with cost (shell vibration, wards risk). Legible price in "sharp intake of breath that locked the memory."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forced eternal echoes as punishment, resonant in CR realization reweighting premise without statement. Final image ("clutching the shell... ready to unravel the webs") non-literally answers "why some people echo forever." Complexity via Council's intrigue avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (acoustic mappings, "perfectly with the spiral geometry"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity ("low, mourning note" to "sharp intake"). Voice distinct, sound-laden diction fits singer without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shell grew hot... vibrating violently" advances plot/embodiment); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening fits taught acoustic pattern without muddling climax sealing. Propulsion peaks in layered echoes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic magic (grafting voices to stone) transforms intrigue tropes via perceptual world rules. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens revelation stakes. Irreplaceable premise payoff in "acoustically grafted to the stone walls."</comment>
