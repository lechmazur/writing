<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Precise curation at apothecary—placing shard amid toast photos—reveals vigilant traits under pressure, earning final satisfaction with embodied toil in mud; minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses caps higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds via stake placements to CR closure: shard reconfigures rumor with legible cost in silt-wiping and climb; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silt slope and algae counter constrain placements, charging final shard image; mirrored hush blurs air/mud, mirroring history's reframe without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expunge rumor) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to apothecary tightening where precise arrangement forecloses scandal path with physical/emotional cost; single meaningful escalation fits length.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with storyteller's perceptual signature (ghosts overlay wreckage); rhythmic hush modulates tension seamlessly, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density weaves action/atmosphere without loops or drift; wind chime silence to final hush propels rhythmically, varying syntax supports accumulative poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resurfacing ruins as curation canvas transforms drought trope into fresh CR of humane myth-making; quiet closure risks bold without gimmick.</comment>
