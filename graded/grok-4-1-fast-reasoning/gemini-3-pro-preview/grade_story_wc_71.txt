<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as "creeping normality noticer" drives specific micro-choices like spotting and placing the root; interiority concrete via embodied scents and silences. Minor flaw: epiphany slightly over-articulated without raw contradictory impulses acting in the placement beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from ambient quiet to "shard of hush" density, landing Conceptual Repricing closure in "a house feels alive when it holds a contradiction" with conceptual cost of decay recognition. Orientation anchored early in bay perimeter walk; single scene holds tightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (tide licking stones, orris violet-earth scent, sodium hum) filter through Elias's perceptual bias, constraining root retrieval and porch placement; Victorian home and root charge final sentinel image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving dormant houses) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via root displacement triggering "shard of hush" and drunk's interruption; agency in sanctifying placement forecloses entropy with felt atmospheric shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of life in contradictions emerges organically from root (dried yet floral) mirroring house history; final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonating via "silence that screams."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in noticing "hushed blaze" and "creeping normality"; rhythmic prose modulates from calm perimeter walk to intensified porch moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("hushed blaze," "shard of hush") varying rhythm; minor deduction for occasional paraphrase loops like repeated silence descriptors in climax beat dulling propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of displaced-object ritual waking houses via "orris root" bridging ocean/home; risk-taking in textural hush-shard concept inevitable in hindsight, heightening quiet stakes.</comment>
