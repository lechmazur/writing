<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's operative gentleness and ritual drive earn the signing choice with embodied grief in generals; Hark's sneer-to-whisper ("Elara") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Generals avoid stereotypes through specific reactions like Vena's ceramic tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds from clipboard reveal to moons' kiss and signing as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting silence with sorrow's cost legible in "weight of their sorrow transfer to him." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twin moons and jasmine/cordite constrain timing and charge final violet light/signing image; terrace mosaic and ruins mirror flawed grief without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy fits Kaelen's gentle focus on ritual over violence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (treaty before celestial drift) signaled early tightens via naming children, forcing trade-off in admission; agency in ritual muster forecloses violence path with emotional cost in trembling hands signing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Redemption theme emerges implicitly from child names etched on silver, culminating in non-literal final image of peace as "burden to be carried"; reweights war's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in gentle phrasing ("voice barely rising above the wind"); dialogue subtextual (Hark's growl yields to whisper), distinct voices, rhythm modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density in ritual beats with varied rhythm; minor overwriting in metaphors ("shadows like wounded beasts") contained, no loops or artifacts dulling signing climax. Propulsion aligns with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ritual of child names on silver under converging moons transforms endless war trope via celestial constraint and grief's flawed beauty; fresh synthesis feels inevitable in Kaelen's burden-carrying close.</comment>
