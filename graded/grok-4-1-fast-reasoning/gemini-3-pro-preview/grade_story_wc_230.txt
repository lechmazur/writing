<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Elias's rational distrust of magic yet rigorous application of mantras "like chemical formulas," earning the final lie-test choice with embodied cost in "cooling numbness." Interiority particular via soil/spore metaphors; flaws (truthfulness) drive isolation without hedging. Final renunciation of collective noise forecloses vulnerability path on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: foraging to ritual to occlusion success narrows options via storm pressure and glass eye constraint. Closure as Decisive Change lands on-page in "resistance did not come," with tenuous cost legible in "fractured grace." Orientation anchored early ("hanging orchard... ravine"); one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hanging orchard's "loam... rough bark... suspension bridges" and storm's "ozone... pelt" constrain foraging/ritual, mirroring chaos silenced at close. Glass eye as micro-setting charges final image, filtering via forager's tactile bias. Sensory hierarchy urgent, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychological safety) signaled early, tightens via ritual agency under causal lens, foreclosing empathy flood with "throbbing anxiety... evaporated." Cost felt in tenuous reliance on "bad science"; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rational isolation vs. viral connection emerges via ritual's "symbolic dead end," resonant in final "privacy of his own thoughts" reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars (truffles, eye) shift meaning; ambiguity lingers in "tenuous peace."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with forager's perceptual signature ("tangible chemistry of soil and spore"); rhythm modulates from storm howl to silent victory. Diction controlled, syntax reflects analytical mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("He sat... tilting his head back, and pressed"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Final line's "sweetest truffle" recharges opener image crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Empathy virus + truthful forager + glass-eye occlusion synthesizes fresh post-apocalyptic solitude angle; risk in pseudoscience payoff feels inevitable, heightening stakes via orchard specificity.</comment>
