<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in suffocation under the ban compels the inscription choice, with embodied pain clarifying numbness; micro-choices like pulse synchronization reveal values. Internal conflict leans resolute without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps density-build to on-page anchoring (DC/RR) with legible cost in "violent jolt" and dissolution, reconfiguring her as vessel; orientation anchored early, closure image charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight garden constrains secrecy (drones, stillness) and enables alignment via star gaps, charging final step; sensory details (bioluminescent hedges, synthetic moss) filter through POV urgency, mirroring internal tides.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful inscription before exile) signaled early, tightens via alignment-to-anchoring under Accumulative lens with agency in pressing stylus; cost felt in pain/jolt foreclosing safe life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of uncontrollable tides vs. banned nostalgia emerges via verse-as-map, resonant in final image of stepping out as vessel without moralizing; particulars like moonstone dissolution reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (tidal/gravity metaphors); rhythmic control heightens ritual pressure, diction biased toward cosmic grace without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; rhythm varies with scene (slow alignment to jolt); minor repetition of "grace" intentional for tone, no loops or muddled metaphors dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancer inscribing banned cosmic verse transforms nostalgia-ban trope via biological anchoring and gravity-map; risk in ritual specificity inevitable to closure.</comment>
