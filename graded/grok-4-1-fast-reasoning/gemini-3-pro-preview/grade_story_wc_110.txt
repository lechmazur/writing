<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to thaw mistrust drives pivotal choice of revealing tickets, earning change with relational cost in Mara's acceptance. Interiority concrete via embodied projection of thought. Minor abstraction in "singular and terrifying" motivation summary slightly dilutes embodiment under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from suspicion to resonant reconfiguration via lens/doodles, with legible cost in "sharing the burden of his crime." Single scene oriented instantly in Forecourt. Closure Charged Poise reconfigures trust with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal Forecourt's damp resonance and singing pillars constrain silent exchange and charge final image: "acoustics catching the silent exchange." Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to empathic hush. Micro-setting (lens, tickets) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as lens amplifies echoes, narrowing options when "barriers tremble." Agency in offering tickets forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in shared crime, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of raw emotion vs. sterile data emerges via doodles' "ambiguously clear" ache, reweighting premise in final bridge of minds without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like spiraling tower shifts meaning organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elian-dominant focalization, perceptual signature in psychic residues. Voice texture poetic yet character-bound, modulating rhythm with hush intensity. No head-hopping; elision of speech purposeful for world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful ("silence... texture-rich presence") without muddle in peak lens beat. Minor overwriting in adjacent metaphors ("frosted... melt") but clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychic doodle residues in post-verbal world transforms trope of misunderstood collector. Risky silence-only communication heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: tickets as "testimonies of the heart."</comment>
