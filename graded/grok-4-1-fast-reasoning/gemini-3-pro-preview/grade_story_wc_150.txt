<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore faith drives consistent micro-choices like root-following and patient rebuilding, earning the final surge of connection; interiority is embodied and particular, though contradictory impulses act more sequentially than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as relic discoveries and reconstruction density build to RR closure in the gnomon-hoisting beam moment, reconfiguring interrupted journeys into continuum with legible emotional cost of healed dislocation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots and bones constrain path and excavation choices while fissure light charges the sundial's final shadow image; sensory details (damp earth, sweet decay) filter through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of faith restoration signaled early and deepens via sundial discovery/rebuild under accumulative lens, narrowing dislocation with patient costs like navigating skeletons; agency peaks in restoration without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys theme emerges organically from relics and sundial breakage, answered non-literally by final shadow pointing north, reweighting past exile as vegetative waiting circle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (roots as guides, bones tenderly cradled); rhythmic texture modulates from hushed twilight to quiet intensity, elisions purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, though minor overwrite density in opening metaphors slightly dulls early propulsion; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts touch closure beam image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sundial-in-tomb premise ingeniously synthesizes light/time interruption with roots/bones orchard, transforming exile trope via specific reconstruction risk into inevitable belonging circle.</comment>
