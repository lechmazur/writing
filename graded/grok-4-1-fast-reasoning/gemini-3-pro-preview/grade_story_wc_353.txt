<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via symphonic perceptions (fern arches, stone percussion); motivation intensifies through past failure to surrendered strum; final weeping earns release with embodied cost, satisfying contradictory patience-obsession impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: omen → failure analysis → empathetic preparation → strum yields RR closure (moan, flight, weeping) with emotional cost legible in final image; orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory specificity (silence as "physical weight," mossy roots) filters through POV bias; alder cleft constrains strum choice; siskins charge final image, mirroring release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music from silence) signaled early, deepens via "scream lines" lesson narrowing rigid vs. fluid tactics; protagonist agency in strum forecloses failure path with thrumming cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of surrender vs. control emerges via particulars (cracks as "silent suicide," sway alignment); final moan reconfigures silence premise without moralizing, resonant and oblique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with symphonic perceptual signature ("suspended score"); rhythmic prose modulates from heavy silence to vibrating release; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "fissures... scream lines"); varied rhythm propels to strum blur; coherent metaphors (cello moan) avoid muddle in climax.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Quieting silence, wood resonance, insulator bridge feels inevitable; risk in lyric build to quiet climax heightens stakes organically.</comment>
