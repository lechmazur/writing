<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in guild expertise and primal desperation intensifies through micro-choices like tracing fissures and precise tapping, earning endurance at climax. Interiority embodied via teeth ache and trembling fingers under stress. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses in pivotal tap moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as noise density builds to hush bloom; single scene anchors Elara, caves, post-arrival invasion by para 1. Closure as RR via "bloom of hush expanded... dissolved," reconfiguring chaos to earned silence with felt cost in slumping against rock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (sonic dominance narrowing to thrum) filters through mapkeeper bias; ice fissures constrain precise tap at "intersection of three stress lines." Charges final image: silence "thick and solid... warm blanket of iron" against cold rock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet vs. fracturing dissonance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as whine nears and teeth ache; agency in examining/tapping forces stasis with cost in "slumped back... dimming" post-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of engineered peace in chaos emerges organically from ice-script mapping to hush bloom, reweighting noise invasion premise. Final image ("heavy stillness... blanket of iron") offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with sonic-biased perceptual signature ("vibration traveled through bone"); rhythmic prose modulates from scouring static to dense thrum, heightening pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, sound (e.g., "low thrum... density of lead"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or muddled metaphors in peak hush bloom despite figurative density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh sonic invasion transformed via geode/ice counter-harmony; risk in mythic acoustics amid sci-fi yields inevitable hush repricing, heightening stakes through mapkeeper specificity (+0.3 risk bonus).</comment>
