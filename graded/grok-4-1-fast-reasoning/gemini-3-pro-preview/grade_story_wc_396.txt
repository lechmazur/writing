<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to map empathy onto action compels the metaphysical search and crystal alignment with embodied traits like pulsing tattoos; internal endurance under council pressure earns the preservation act without safety-hedging; micro-choices reveal value hierarchy in patient navigation of mirrors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: need for prisoner's mercy proof therefore internal lighthouse search therefore mirror-crystal reconstitution therefore glowing projection changes council resolve; on-page DC closure with felt cost in shard's heat/vibration; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard and ice floes frame stakes with groaning pressure; internal repository's mirrors constrain search choices, cheval mirror charges anomaly discovery; final beacon projection recharges lighthouse metaphor, sensory details (salt spray, frost-bitten apples) filter through Kaelen's intuitive bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove mercy to save prisoner/council) signaled early, tightens causally via intuitive guidance to anomaly find and precise alignment; agency in will-driven stitching forecloses war path with visible cost in receding shadows and halting ice; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as physical shield emerges organically from anomaly reconstitution and projection washing grim resolve; final image of soldier's mercy and stopped ice offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting peace as strength; no moralizing, ambiguity in council shift lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in shadow pulses and intuitive currents; voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm for mental dive; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven in "There is another way," advancing closure without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence lengths; vivid specificity propels via integrated sensory/action lines; minor overwriting in opening descriptors ("tectonic complaints") but no loops or artifacts dulling closure's crystal flare and projection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphysical synthesis of mirrors, crystal, and anomalies transforms mercy trope into intuitive navigation of lost timelines; risk in time-dilated internal shard heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established lighthouse repository logic.</comment>
