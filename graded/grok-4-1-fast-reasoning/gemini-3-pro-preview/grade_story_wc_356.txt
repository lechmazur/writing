<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied olfaction dissects scent as "symphony played in a minor key," revealing contradictory drive for stillness amid motion; final realization earns renunciation of naive anchoring with heart-level cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from seed to bloom's "burgundy skirt," culminating in CR via "anchor drop within her heart"; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring sway of bridges and humidity constrain journaling method and charge final "chaotic map...inside a discarded wrapper"; sensory hierarchy (olfactory primacy) filters treetop vividly without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity amid motion) tightens via bloom's timed unfurl and scent-decoding reversal, reweighting options under Accumulative lens; cost legible in worldview shift foreclosing illusion of stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rot-as-wisdom emerges organically from scent's "layered narrative," resonant in final image reweighting cycle without moralizing; no thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with olfactory perceptual signature ("damp scent of rain hours before"); rhythmic modulation peaks in frantic strokes of drawing, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action with texture ("floorboards creaked under the stress"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, though minor overwriting in opening sway metaphors doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower in swaying canopy with wrapping-paper ritual transforms botanical trope; risk in olfactory mysticism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via realization.</comment>
