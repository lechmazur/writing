<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's wilting embodies contradictory impulses under pressure, compelling higher-stakes demands from the clerk; final resolve to repurpose gold ink feels earned by somatic costs endured twice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain from map-piecing to plate revelation holds tightly; CR closure via "She would slip this truth onto the leaves" reconfigures role with irreplaceable conceptual cost, lens intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome's yellow haze and sub-basement mildew constrain descent and force embodied wilting; zinc plate charges final image, mirroring internal shift through tactile handling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sequestered truths emerges via zinc erasures and wilting herbicide, answered non-literally in plant-circulation resolve; no moralizing, complexity in small candor pivots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with calligrapher's perceptual bias (leaf veins to zinc script); dialogue subtext forces clerk's whisper, rhythm modulates from haze to gasping recovery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Wilting somatic lie-detector ingeniously synthesizes dystopia with postal plates, transforming bureaucratic erasure into verdant truth-circulation; bold premise integration feels inevitable.</comment>
