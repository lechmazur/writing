<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through micro-choices like layering tracks and sculpting silence, compelling the exorcism. Interiority concrete via professional focus on signal paths and knobs. Limited embodied contradiction in emotions under peak stress keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pedal stomps and loops cause ripples in Vantablack, culminating in DC closure when palette splatters with felt risk of failure. Orientation anchored early in station and characters. Cost legible in "trembling like water" buildup to expulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via Kellen's audio bias: ozone, vibrating grating, heavy air constrain amp setup and silence pockets. Vantablack palette as micro-setting charges final splatter image. Muffled clarity tone guides perception without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exorcise before possession) tightens causally through track layers narrowing entity's grip, with agency in knob adjustments foreclosing surrender. Escalation driven by Kellen under causal lens, cost in entity's resistance greying the paint. No reversal overload fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of breaking assumptions emerges organically via loops shattering certainty, resonant in final "assumptions are made to be broken" without moralizing. Vantablack shift reweights creativity vs. abyss. Complexity in sonic logic avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close to Kellen with perceptual signature in audio terms like "signal path" and "wave peaks." Rhythm modulates with pressure, diction purposeful. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven in final exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "stomped on the 'Record' switch" advancing action and sound motif. Varied rhythm, no major loops, but minor overwrite in "swirling architecture of grammar" slightly dulls peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Loop-pedal exorcism via rhetoric and silence transforms possession trope organically, fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight. Risk in acoustic paradoxes heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final palette splatter recharges premise boldly.</comment>
