<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism drives micro-choices like tracking footprints and tossing amber, earning the climactic renunciation with embodied pulse betrayal; Aris applies confirming pressure without overshadowing. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("biological experimentation") slightly abstracts interiority but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via ascent discoveries to CR closure in amber toss, reweighting pilgrimage with conceptual cost of exploited weakness; orientation anchored in first paragraph, lens holds cleanly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory specifics like slick basalt, ozone-crushed petals constrain climb and mirror internal detachment; rainwashed platform and ivy-strangled path charge final convergence and toss image without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of validating synthetic migration tightens via Aris confirmation, forcing Elara's renunciation with foreclosed return path; one deepening suffices under accumulative lens, cost legible in pulsing light and toss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Home-as-chemical-weakness emerges organically from particulars, amber reprise reconfiguring premise without statement; resonant CR ending answers pilgrimage question via rebellion image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature biases toward data (e.g., stride-matching footprints), rhythmic diction modulates tension; sparse dialogue carries subtext and distinction without indirection excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sense/action (e.g., pollen-dust footprints), varied rhythm propels ascent; minor repetition of "bronze quiet" and "heavy silence" risks paraphrase loop but serves tone without dulling toss propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skinner-box towers transform pilgrimage trope via pheromonal fuel synthesis; amber's stasis-to-rebellion arc feels inevitable, bold CR risks heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
