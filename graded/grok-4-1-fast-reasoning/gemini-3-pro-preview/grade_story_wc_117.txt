<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied cautious exuberance swelling in his chest; micro-choices like deliberate tuning and restrained movements reveal values under fragile timing pressure. Elara's passivity limits relational crucible, but Elias's motivation to nurture wonder earns her breakthrough without unearned epiphany. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously, but traits drive the climax placement of the curl.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tuning to eclipse totality, with closure as on-page Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's gasp and tears amid corona, cost in the fading "hush" felt via returning light and lingering light in her eyes. Single scene oriented early (plateau, wheelchair); one tightening via approaching totality narrows to critical palm placement. Lens unambiguous; persistent eclipse constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via Elias's priorities: silvered light, plummeting chill constrain timing and shiver sagebrush, mirroring internal poise. Eclipse corona and wheelchair incline guide choices (brakes locked); recurring ridge evolves with unnatural twilight. Environment charges closure image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—pierce dementia via eclipse—tightens accumulatively to totality placement, foreclosing delay with fragile timing cost. Agency in Elias's murmured prompt and chord cessation forces Elara's stance crystallization; pressure coheres without reversal, cost legible in temporary "link snapping" amid fading hush. No live option fully tested pre-climax slightly limits peak trade-off visibility.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges via particulars: curl anchors memory, eclipse pierces fog without statement. Final image—Elara smiling at dark sun, light remaining—resonates non-literally, reweighting wonder's endurance with fragile cost. Subtext in adaptive surge softens confusion organically; no moralizing.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Stable third-limited Elias with perceptual signature: nature as "whistled" wind and "shiver[ing]" brush biases noticing. Voice modulates rhythm to intensity, compressing at totality; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("Feel the softness"). Diction controlled, prose-as-character reflects therapist's attuned calm under peak chill.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High density: lines integrate action, image, interior (e.g., "fingers dancing... vehicle, but eclipse road"). Varied rhythm accelerates to totality without loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent (magic as "water filling a cup"). No figurative muddle or register drift in climax.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eclipse as "hush of dreaming roots" transforms dementia therapy trope via ordinary magic and hair curl anchor. Risky metaphysical frame ("softly adaptive") heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration inevitable from timed particulars. Non-obvious eclipse-hair link personalizes wonder without gimmick.</comment>
