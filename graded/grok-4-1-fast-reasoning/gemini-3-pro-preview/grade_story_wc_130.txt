<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in daughter's ambiguous loss drives inventive ritual with embodied precision ("logic dictated that if grief had a weight"), culminating in earned shift to optimism; minor diagnostic label-speak ("ambiguous loss") slightly abstracts peak realization without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density building to spectral image (CR closure reweighting loss with meadow destination); orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "the ambiguous loss remained, but the data had changed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cavern orchard and mosaic stone constrain ritual choices (eyes aligned to fault lines) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (mineral tears, grinding teeth) reflects Silas's calculative POV; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve loss equation) escalates via ritual tightening to spectral meadow image, narrowing options with knowledge shift; agency in subtle preparations yields felt cost of partial failure charging poise toward recalibration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's mathematics emerges organically from ritual failure to optimistic reweighting; final meadow-cave contrast offers non-literal resonance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "infinitely complex" solution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature of geometric precision ("chaotic algorithm," "dovetail"); rhythmic control modulates from setup to peak flare; diction matches inventive conjurer's lexicon seamlessly.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax and purposeful metaphors ("gelatinous uncertainty," "grinding teeth"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddle; propulsion peaks at "eyes seemed to flare," resolving via charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of math-emotion ritual via glass eyes/mosaic transforms grief trope; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes; "dovetail" joinery feels inevitable from inventive setup.</comment>
