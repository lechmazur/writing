<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's blind spot to the present drives her mistake in reaching for the pearl, earning the final realization of seeing Kael as "breath and blood." Contradictory impulses—grand foresight vs. immediate oversight—act in scene with embodied cost. Minor slip in epiphany phrasing but closure choice motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from prediction to chaotic pearl activation to CR closure in pearl's lasting glow and Elara's jolt. Orientation anchored early in cave and arrival. Cost legible in overlooked "microscopic miracles" reweighting her vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent crystals and "bright darkness" constrain via shadow intersection triggering forces. Sensory details (humming, silhouettes) filtered through Elara's seer bias, charging final image. Setting evolves with pearl's activation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of structured fate vs. unpredictable present tightens via shadow bridge, forcing realization. Agency in hand extension narrows options; cost felt in frozen surprise and foreclosed prophetic filter. Escalation accumulative, cost unmistakable in weeping pilgrim and lit pearl.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mundane magic over grand disasters emerges via pearl's images (dew, bread, hand), reweighting Elara's arc without statement. Final image of pearl as "permanent monument" offers resonant answer to oversight premise. Emergent from particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with seer-specific perceptual signature (structured time vs. chaotic rhythm). Voice modulates poetically yet precisely; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual in Kael's whisper. Rhythmic control heightens wonder without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "shadow bridge") without muddle in peak activation. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear through images. Minor density in opening but closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geode magic awakening "ambient wonder" via shadows transforms clairvoyant trope. Risky "bright darkness" tone heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in mundane magnification from pearl handoff.</comment>
