<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between father's destruction and her restorative ritual act simultaneously in the grafting scene; final breath release earns validation with emotional cost, rooted in penance backstory anchored by charred branch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to hum's RR/CR closure; on-page cost legible in "minutes stretched into hours" patience and hovering hand, with lagoon constraining the graft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lagoon's obsidian stillness and buoyancy constrain the coin-secured graft, charging final hum; selective sensory hierarchy (visual darkness to resonant sound) mirrors her poised alert perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to revive scars tightens via dissolving sand and rising hum under accumulative lens; agency in ritual forecloses destructive path with felt emotional cost in held breath, though no reversal beyond deepening wait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fire-to-hum transformation reweights destruction/compassion theme via branch's "scream" to "hum"; final coin-click image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward organic revival (e.g., "scars can sing"); rhythmic modulation builds from kelp-drift to vibrant hum, stable close-third POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in ritual beats; figurative pattern (fire/water marriage) taught early pays off at hum without muddle, though minor stem repetition ("she" actions) in wait slightly dulls peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ritual grafting of cello-branch from ashes synthesizes penance/firefighter tropes into inevitable, fresh CR; bold lagoon mechanics heighten stakes without gimmick.</comment>
