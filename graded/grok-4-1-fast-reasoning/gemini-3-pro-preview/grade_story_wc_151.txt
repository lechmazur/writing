<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through micro-choices like naming "Arthur Pendelton," but label-like statement "His motivation was simple yet profound" slightly abstracts interior drive without embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from chalk signal to letter's folding; Charged Poise closure in standing to deliver crystallizes rebellion with legible cost in "chaos and peril of the physical world."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Golden light evolution and brass chute constrain progression and charge final image; tactile details like "friction that touchscreens could never simulate" filter through POV priorities without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting evasive pseudonym tightens via chalk interpretation to ritual folding under surveillance pressure; one deepening reweights digital vs. physical with felt slowness cost, though low external antagonism limits to strong band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tangible rebellion emerges organically from ink vs. binary acts; final letter as "physical artifact" offers resonant non-literal answer to margins-vs-optimization without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in texture obsessions; rhythmic modulation builds nostalgic texture without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but clustered metaphors like "bruised light... ghostly... flickering shadows" in opening create minor figurative muddle without pattern payoff, dulling early propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cyberpunk nostalgia via obsolete mail crafts organic premise; chalk codes transform surveillance trope through lived rebellion without hedging.</comment>
