<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas's interiority shines in embodied details like trembling fingers and raw throat, driving an earned shift from haunted observation to musical release; dynamically observant trait enables key perceptions without safety-hedging. Minor slip: motivation explicitly stated late ("His motivation had always been singular") borders on diagnostic, but prior micro-choices anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density buildup from vanishing to glass alignment to pixelated amnesty; on-page CR closure ("world remained bathed in... low-resolution light") reconfigures reality with legible emotional cost in guilt's dissolution. Orientation anchors early (pullout, truck, vanished hitchhiker); no shard violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain ravine, scaffold plastic, and truck dashboard constrain choices (glass alignment across ravine) and charge final image (buffering bridge); sensory details (snapping waves, ether smell, violet glow) filter through fiddler's rhythmic bias. Environment evolves with wind and fog, mirroring internal softening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape "never" via forgiveness) deepens accumulatively through perceptual intensifications, narrowing to amnesty realization; agency in lifting glass and playing fiddle forecloses sharp-reality path with felt guilt-cost. Escalation coheres under lens, one decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of glitch-forgiveness emerges organically from glass-plastic interference, reweighting "never" premise in final low-res horizon without moralizing; resonant CR ending ("buffering") answers central question via image, embracing ambiguity of altered reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (rhythm-pattern noticing, fiddler metaphors like "wind's percussion"); lyrical compression taught early (mist, static) pays off legibly at closure. Rhythmic syntax modulates from eerie to luminous without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "plastic pulsed in a binary code" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or stacks. Minor overwriting in peak metaphors ("pixelated amnesty" coherent but dense), but purposeful for textural lens without closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of 19th-century glass, binary flutters, and digital glitch transforms vanishing trope into fresh CR on forgiveness; risk-taking in perceptual superposition heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
