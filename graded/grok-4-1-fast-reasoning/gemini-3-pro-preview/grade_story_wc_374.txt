<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's luminous skepticism drives concrete micro-choices like taste-navigation and observation, with embodied doubt faltering into acceptance at "a small, gray cloud began to form just above her palms." Internal conflict layers realistically without therapy-speak; change feels earned via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure where compass locks and cloud forms, reweighting her observer status with conceptual cost legible in final image. Orientation anchors early in redwoods/polling; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (taste spikes like "copper and sour lemon," bioluminescence) filters through Elara's priorities, constraining navigation and charging closure image of dimming light/cloud. Lavender bluff under aurora grounds cosmic scale tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn weather-carriage cause) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via convergence and realization, narrowing options to her election with felt cost in cloud formation over hands. Agency in pursuit forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of algorithm vs. soul emerges organically from particulars like emergent compass and weather redistribution, resonant CR in "She had wanted to dismantle a myth, but she had uncovered a function" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in taste/light biases; rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise at ending. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You are the ballots" / "We are the outcome") advances revelation cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm; minor figurative density in opening ("root systems humming") purposeful for texture, no loops/muddle touching closure. Propulsion peaks in final image without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vegetative democracy/weather carriers transforms eco-sci-fi tropes organically; risk in taste-navigation and election twist inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes boldly.</comment>
