<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's obsessive motivation rooted in singular trait (speaks dead languages) compels precise ritual choices with embodied focus; internal endurance of nightly vigils forecloses normal life with felt cost in "one seed at a time."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density building to on-page RR (green light pulses, kelp spirals); cost legible in "stitching the wound...closed" reconfiguring barren world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Blooming jetty's phosphorescent buds and oily water constrain veil-thinning choice at pier's end, charging closure's emerald tapestry; sensory hierarchy (bird screeches over waves) mirrors POV attunement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (submerged concord) tightens via bird-guided cast narrowing options; agency in "Aethel garda" whisper forces payoff with visible cost in prior barrenness yielding to growth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory fertilizing war wounds emerges via seed pods/kelp mirroring battlefield reclamation; final image ("battlefield...consumed by...roots") resonantly reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (dead-language bird syntax) and rhythmic prose modulate from "narrow vastness" to "promise of returning breath"; no head-hopping, diction biased to ritual attunement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (e.g., "husks brittle and etched with spiral patterns") without loops or muddle; rhythm varies to peak at "bioluminescence spread," propelling to charged closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war eco-ritual via bird-oracle seeds transforms reclamation trope; risk in "speaks dead languages" dead ancients heightens stakes organically through grounded fantasy logic.</comment>
