<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Solitary POV shines with concrete interiority and embodied pressure (trembling fingers, sharp inhalation), earning endurance of the "heavy, solemn burden" as closure cost; contradictory impulses in gripping/slipping anchors act in scene. Motivation roots consistently in honoring histories, compelling the metaphysical surgery. No safety-hedging flaws; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lens immersion to anchor flaring and release, landing Charged Poise RR in "energy released... filling his mind with the keeper’s final prayer," with legible cost in pallbearer grace. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in market/job. Closure reconfigures painting from charged to "flat," foreclosing its depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lens fragment as micro-setting constrains core choice (bends light, intensifies for surgery) and charges final cooling edges; vivid sensory weave (sulfur/lavender, cold spray) filters through Elian's priorities, evolving causally (soot dissolves, wind rushes). Market's high platforms ground spatial coherence without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (extract tragedy intact) signaled early, tightens texturally via anchor stability to unfastening reversal, narrowing to successful release; agency in hovering/pulling forecloses failure path with burden cost charging "grace of a pallbearer." Pressure coheres accumulatively without abstractness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bridging forgotten voids emerges organically from anchors/ghosts to final "repository of endurance"; closing book offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting "void of forgotten time" without moralizing. Particulars (tear glint, keeper's prayer) yield complexity over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (psychic residue, spectral glows); rhythmic control modulates from immersive density to post-release exhale, prose texture distinct in prismatic diction. No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful metaphors ("metaphysical surgery") integrate without muddle in peak unfastening. Minor overwriting in descriptive swells doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-ghost metaphysics via lens-anchors transforms overlooked-history trope; risk in "elusively tangible" navigation pays off inevitably at exhausted canvas, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
