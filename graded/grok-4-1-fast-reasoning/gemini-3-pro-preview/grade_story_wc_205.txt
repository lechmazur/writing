<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's revolutionary past and poetic impulses drive contradictory actions like ignoring the storm command for mirror-covering, earning the final trembling-hand victory with sorrow cost. Thorne applies relevant pressure as foil. Minor label-speak in "poetically inclined mind seeing... a stanza of chaotic potential" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dispute to storm-shard projection as CR, reconfiguring history perception with legible cost in "burdened by the victory... could not bring back the dead." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early, one tightening via shard alignment suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and visible Time constrain choices: storm forces vault urge, mirrors must be covered to enable projection, shard on pedestal charges final image. Sensory hierarchy poetic via Elian's bias; details evolve causally with storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (win dispute via reimagined history) signaled early, tightens via shard-storm devise narrowing options to fabrication risk. Agency in alignment forces Thorne's shake-up; cost felt in Elian's tremor and closing sorrow under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of perception-as-reality emerges organically from shard vision overwriting "rigid hierarchies" with "beautiful anarchy," resonant CR in final sorrow image reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature ("hours drifted... like phosphorescent pollen"); voice modulates from murmur to command at climax. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("The gale sings of memory"); no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, but figurative overwriting strains in opener ("heart... polishing the grief until they shone with a terrible, heavy beauty"; "silver tongues"). No loops; propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible Time refracting memory via shard transforms revolutionary trope; risk in superstition-mechanics pays off at projection, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
