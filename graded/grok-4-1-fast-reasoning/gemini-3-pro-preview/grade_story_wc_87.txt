<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied recoil of regrets as rib-snapping halyard and shaking hand propel micro-choice to snap compass shut, earning final renunciation of deep-water command with visible diminishment cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pole-focus density reconfigures navigation from abyss to shallows; closure lands in final paddling image with legible cost of forfeited captaincy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poles as scarred "man-made constellation" constrain shore-hugging path and charge final image; fog panic-to-hum fog evolution mirrors internal stabilization through tactile surf scrape and transformer buzz.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog-obscured panic flare forces pole-rereliance tightening under Accumulative lens, narrowing open-bay option with protagonist endurance; cost felt in "small... acceptable" repricing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final "broken, yes, but... moving" image non-literally answers heart-action rift via copper-wire mending, reweighting grand navigation premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters poles through fractured nautical lens (siren vs. buzz); rhythmic modulation peaks in shanty hum without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied nautical syntax; minor paraphrase loops on regrets/poles (-0.3) but no closure muddle or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Utility poles ingeniously transform celestial navigation trope into mundane lifeline, synthesizing regret-backlash with grid linearity for inevitable survivor arc.</comment>
