<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's wistfully pragmatic shift from biological to mechanical care is embodied in letting the petal drop and precisely coaxing the joint, earning the final endurance with felt loss of the rose's vibrancy. Contradictory impulses—missing softness yet stoic acceptance—act simultaneously in the sigh and nod. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy, with no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: petal drop initiates density build to joint repair and beam success, with Charged Poise closure in the steady light conduit. Orientation anchored early in fire escape over harbor. One tightening via seized joint narrows options; cost legible in fragile setup's exposure to winds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mirrors, tin cans, and gauge tooth constrain choices, charging final beam image; damp air seizes joint as lived-in pressure. Sensory hierarchy (oily sheen, rusted slats, salt corrosion) filters through gardener's priorities, mirroring internal decay/renewal without overt symbolism. Harbor glow as resource evolves causally to conduit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (light to dark window) signaled early, tightens via corroded joint forcing precise tactics; success forecloses plant-tending path with vulnerability cost. Agency in fluid coaxing and nudging under Accumulative lens; moral calculus in renewal over decay. Felt price in ephemeral beam's exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile renewal emerges organically from rose death to light bloom, reweighted in final "light remained, blooming in the dark." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like blackened stems to protected beam. Protagonist arc inextricable from light-as-compassion question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with gardener's perceptual signature (thorns vs. glow, tool geometries). Rhythmic control modulates: fluid "rhythm of oars" heightens repair tension. No elision or head-hopping; diction purposeful, biased to mechanical care.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., breeze rattling exposes petal drop's stakes); varied rhythm propels from hush to beam without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent and sparse in peak (synthetic flower deploys). Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Repurposed lockmaster tool and mirror rig transform urban isolation trope into ingenious light conduit; fresh synthesis of decay/ingenuity feels inevitable. Risk in mechanical renewal over organic heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
