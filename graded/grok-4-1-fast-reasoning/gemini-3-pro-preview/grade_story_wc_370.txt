<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's empathy embodied in crowd avoidance and aura withdrawal creates contradiction under pressure; final acceptance earned via prior causality, but epiphany line "his life of hiding... revealed himself" borders tidy without deeper flaw confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of paradoxes building to CR closure; invitation error and psychic hide anchor orientation early, with "staying while leaving" as decisive reconfiguration costing prior isolation worldview.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bench and fern as micro-setting constrain entry action; transformation to shelves/silver tree charges final image of belonging, with sensory shift from station noise to tranquility mirroring internal arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of claiming mistaken invitation tightens accumulatively via hide action narrowing mundane/spiritual options; cost felt in "tension unravel" and reframed pain, though escalation lacks one sharper agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Paradox theme emerges organically from invitation error to Librarian's logic; final "silence... full" reweights premise without moralizing, resonating via Elian's arc in sanctuary image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in empathetic noticing (vibrating emotions); Librarian dialogue subtextual and voice-distinct as page rustle, modulating rhythm under detachment stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in "falling upward" detachment; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "vast and expanding peace" slightly dulls peak transition without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Psychic hide into paradox library transforms secret society trope via empathy specificity; "universe... clerical errors" premise fresh, with risk-taking in nested logics heightening closure resonance.</comment>
