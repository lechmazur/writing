<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation from past-life memory drives concrete micro-choices like lens swap and breathing sync, earning his lighter chest at closure; embodied curiosity shines in forensic spirit approach. Minor weakness: internal conflict mostly told via backstory, not simultaneous impulses in healing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations builds from blurry image to thorn dissolution and CR realization ("reservoir... was not a place, but an action") with felt cost in Silas's reduced heart pressure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, closure legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (velvet moss, luminescent vines, foggy lucidity) filter through Silas's photographic bias, constraining choices like tripod sinking and bench positioning; viaduct backdrop charges final packing image with liminal poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unused love) signaled early, tightens via spirit encounter and breathing revelation narrowing to healing agency; cost legible in poured-out love lightening Silas's chest, reweighting options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspent love as mercy-fuel emerges organically from thorn-dissolving projection and final CR, resonant without statement; gold glow image reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light-trapping metaphors and inverted image focus; rhythmic prose modulates from setup density to exhale tension, consistent diction fits artist's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (elongated exhales mirror syntax); no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (tear bending trauma light). Minor overwriting in opening descriptions doesn't touch closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura as soul-healer with love-as-fuel premise transforms photography tropes; risk in breathing mechanics and Tear channeling feels inevitable, heightening spiritual stakes organically.</comment>
