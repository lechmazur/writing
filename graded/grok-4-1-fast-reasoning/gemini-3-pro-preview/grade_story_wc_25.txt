<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove whispers over shouts roots every micro-choice, from identifying Kael's walk to the grounding rod reveal; internal consistency shines in his silent catwalk vs. Kael's noise. Final coin placement earns the renunciation of direct conflict with conceptual cost to Kael. Kael as foil applies pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: walk identification therefore interception, folded map therefore shortcut, storm therefore grounding key unlocks Blind Box. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as CR in "unfolded his map, flattening the crease," repricing noise vs. silence with sirens as cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storm charges latches and scrambles GPS, constraining Kael while enabling Elias's map tactic; shipping stacks form lived-in maze. Aurora's green light charges final confrontation image. Sensory filter (boot rhythms, static hairs) biases to Elias's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whisper supremacy) tightens causally via map shortcut narrowing Kael's options; agency in tossing key forces Kael's noisy path. Escalation peaks at Blind Box failed slam, cost legible in sirens drawn by noise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: shout echoes messily vs. projected whisper, culminating in non-literal answer—"you brought the whole port with you"—reweighting premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in Elias's content escape lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (rhythms, folds); dialogue subtextual ("open the heart of the maze"). Rhythmic control modulates: short sentences in storm heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere without loops; rhythm varies (long setup folds to punchy "groan open"). Minor figurative density ("ghostly shades") purposeful, not muddying climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of port maze, folding maps, geomagnetic physics transforms chase trope; grounding rod turn inevitable from storm setup. Risk in conceptual chase (silence vs. noise) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
