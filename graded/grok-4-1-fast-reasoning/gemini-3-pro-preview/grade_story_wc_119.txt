<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via specific prophetic examples ("Watch for leaks"); contradictory impulses peak in realization that fiction bleeds into reality, earning final choice with felt cost of severance. Blind spots (prophetic curse) drive mistake-compounding before resolution. Voice coherent and particular; no label-speak flattens embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from desk unease to light action, closure as Charged Poise in "declaration of freedom" with conceptual cost of broken ties legible in final beam sweep. Orientation anchored early (lighthouse, late hour). One tightening via realization suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresnel lens/mercury bath constrain choice, charging final image as "language of pure luminance." Sensory hierarchy (light rhythm, ocean crash) filtered through spy priorities; details tactile/lived-in (hydraulic levers). Recurrent specs as micro-setting evolve via reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break espionage cycle) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via prophetic attribute to agency in light orchestration; cost unmistakable in "sever his ties forever." Pressure coheres to reweight freedom over paranoia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fiction-reality bleed emerges organically from fortune-encoding to light-message; final "changed the tune" reweights premise non-literally with ambiguity (enigma requires no solution). Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (microdot scrutiny, beam as spycraft). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity (stuttered beam mirrors resolve); diction purposeful, no filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in action: "The beam stuttered, swung wild"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("glass hive," "minor scale"). Propulsion aligns with beats; zero scaffold dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prophetic fortunes + lighthouse beam as resignation transforms spy tropes; risk in physical "writing...across the sky" inevitable from prior particulars, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
