<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and internal conflict via trembling palm and past cyanide hesitation propel the redemption choice; final pillbox placement feels earned. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "branding of cowardice" slightly abstracts peak emotion without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: snow codes trigger helicopter response, dialogue narrows to proof exchange, closing with basket ascent as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where aloneness reconfigures past disgrace with felt cost in "dangerous, necessary work of living." Orientation anchors early; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow, mist, and precipice constrain choices—codes visible yet deniable, downwash erases plea—charging final image of Elias alone in "silver hush." Sensory hush dampens wind, mirrors internal thaw; vivid, selective, POV-filtered without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake signaled early tightens via hovering heli and winch radio, forcing proof trade-off; agency in stomping and placing pillbox forecloses death path with visible erasure cost. Escalation causal under lens, cost legible in obliterated codes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of "fixing what's broken" emerges organically from pillbox evolution and snow codes, resonating in final realization of courage "in the dangerous, necessary work of living" without moralizing. Particulars like microdot reprise reweight self-disgrace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (mist as "suffocating, endless," breath as "smoke from a dying fire"); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("Ghosts don't leave footprints"). Rhythm modulates with pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel momentum; opening metaphors purposeful under accumulative tone. Minor register elevation ("vouchsafe," "filigree") fits literary voice without drift; no loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Snow-code signaling and pillbox-from-cyanide-to-proof transform spy tropes freshly; risk of fog-denied visibility heightens stakes organically. Premise synthesis inevitable via "prudently daring" mechanics.</comment>
