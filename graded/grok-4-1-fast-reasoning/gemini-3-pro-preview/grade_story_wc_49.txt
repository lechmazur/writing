<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation singular and intensifies compellingly through grandmother's songs into the hum; embodied trembling fingers and exhaustion reveal character under pressure. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in grafting beat, but micro-choices align consistently with whimsical traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from machine setup to vine graft, song resonance, and golden projections dissolving with vine's spent cost as CR closure. Orientation anchored in opening lines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant arbor's trellis supplies constraining vine and frames final slumped exhaustion; sensory hierarchy (damp earth, pulsing vine) reflects tinker's priorities. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore practices pre-horizon) signaled early tightens via dormant machine needing organic bridge, deepening to golden stories revelation under lens. Agency in graft/hum forecloses failure path; exhaustion and vine cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of spiritual reawakening emerges organically from golden tableaux seeping into dreams, reweighting neglect in final "air in the valley felt different" image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (notices residual magic, luminescence); diction/rhythm modulates from expectant hush to swirling joy. No head-hopping or withholding; elision purposeful for dawn alignment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short shudders in activation beat, breathing dissolution); high density integrates action/imagery without loops. Minor overwriting in "chaotic harmony" metaphors purposeful for lyric texture, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-machine grafted with living vine/song spins moon into dream-stories; risk-taking in magical tableaux heightens reawakening stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight from setup.</comment>
