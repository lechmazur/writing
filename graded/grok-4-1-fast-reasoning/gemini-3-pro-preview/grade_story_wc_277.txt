<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to uncover truths drives logical micro-choices like writing the proof, embodied in pen's cedar smell and ink grooves; internal conflict subtle but present in desperate need versus rational poise. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during crisis peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via call → mental ledger check → proof-writing → rebuttal call, landing Decisive Change in "threat dissipated" with cost in journalist's heavy silence and orbit shift; orientation anchored early, closure cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory's glass walls and cloud floor constrain isolation and reflection, charging final "clouds shift" image that mirrors orbit reconfiguration; sensory details (pen's cedar-iron scent, ink grooves, dome echo) selective and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dismantle allegation) tightens via proof's contradiction narrowing denial option, driven by her agency in phone rebuttal; cost felt in "narrative collapsed" and tactical shift, though reputational scale slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of logical orbits averting regret emerges organically through proof dismantling and final spin-away image, offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing; "gravitational coherence" subtext reweights journalist's error.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (elliptical regrets, solemn playfulness); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("equation equals zero"), rhythm modulates from reflective to rhythmic dialing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels proof beat; no loops, coherent metaphors (orbits, perigee), purposeful overwriting absent; final line recharges cloud motif without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical metaphor for regret and heiress's cloudtop logic-play transforms legacy defense trope; risk in "proof by contradiction" method heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
