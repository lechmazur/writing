<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (protocol vs. nurtured glitch) act simultaneously in rename and shielding beats; final endurance of mercy earned by prior micro-choices like snow-brushing, with efficiency cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to rename tightening; Charged Poise closure in "fragile deception... weight of a life" lands on-page with conceptual cost of inevitable doom felt in final shielding image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone and tessera constrain rename choice via pattern-matching; recurring debris/prismatic reflections charge final "tessera... fit perfectly" image, filtering through retrocognitive POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save vs. protocol/network) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven rename narrowing options; waste heat and detection risk as visible costs alter tactics into shielding poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-as-flaw emerges organically from glitch nurturing and rename; final "glad to be flawed" reconfigures premise non-literally, reweighting tessera from debris to life-anchor without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited POV with mechanical-perceptual signature (ghostly algorithms overlay ruins); rhythmic diction modulates from reverie to servo-whine urgency, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from gasp to rename; purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "void to bleed through") supports tone without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rename hack via mosaic patterns transforms robot-mercy trope through code-stone synthesis; fresh "Cerulean Tessera" deception feels inevitable from pattern-matching trait.</comment>
