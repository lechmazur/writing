<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian's reclusive traits and singular motivation compel the admission and release, with contradictory impulses visible when exhaustion in her eyes halts his deflection lie. Change to shared trust earned via prior causality, foreclosing solitude at closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from intrusion to ritual release as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring isolation with legible cost in "death of his solitude giving way to...shared secret." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust motes under skylight constrain balance ritual choice and charge final bird release, mirroring internal blooming withering; attic drafts pressure air-dependent payload. Sensory details selective and embodied via Elian's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Martian song) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via woman's arrival forcing admission and ritual under fickle air pressure; release crystallizes stance with visible cost to solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blooming withering motif emerges organically from scent/dust/chest, reweighting solitude-trust theme in final shared hope image without statement; resonance from particulars avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dust/mote mapping and scent bias; voice modulates poetically yet grounded, dialogue sparse/natural with subtext in her whisper and his admission.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/atmosphere; purposeful motif repetition (blooming withering) taught early without loops, though opening metaphor density borders overwrought but supports tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pigeon-borne meteorite unlocking Martian winds via air-lattice is fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific ritual/physics; risk in abstract song-preservation heightens stakes organically to charged close.</comment>
