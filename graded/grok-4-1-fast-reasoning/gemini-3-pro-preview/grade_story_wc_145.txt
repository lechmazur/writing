<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dry-witted traits shine in "Show-off" mutter to physics and punctual-train nod to falcon, rooting motivation in editorial precision; contradictory impulses emerge in hesitation over recording revelation, earning final renunciation with conceptual cost of unprinted truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify from waiting to falcon signal, breath-map convergence, and CR closure; cost legible in "wouldn't record the coordinates... too true to be printed," reweighting metaphysical premise without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grime-clouded viewport and shifting ice constrain breath action and charge final weeping-map image; sensory hierarchy (rime frost shakes, condensation curves) filters through editor's map-obsessed POV, mirroring internal quest without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rivers' metaphysical origin) signaled early tightens accumulatively via falcon return and breath-agency to nexus revelation; cost unmistakable in hovered-pen hesitation and unrecorded truth foreclosing legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of intent-convergence origins emerges organically from breath-summoned map shifting from "wrong" ink approximations; final "close the book" image resonantly reweights editorial premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of unprintable truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (geometry as "polite suggestion," miracles "filed in triplicate") modulates wry diction under revelation; rhythmic control peaks in condensation's "lines, curves, and tributaries," no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short "He nodded" punches against flowing descriptions); zero loops or scaffolds, purposeful metaphors like "bruised sky" propel without muddle, clarity peaks in pivotal breath-map beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphysical rivers via breath-map ingeniously transforms atlas-editing trope; fresh synthesis of polyglot anchor and falcon signal feels inevitable, bold CR risks quiet stasis without gimmickry.</comment>
