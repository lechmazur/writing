<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (pounce vs. curiosity-driven restraint) act vividly in the confrontation beat, earning the final endurance with embodied homesick cost; interiority particular via fur sensations and dimensional ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands cleanly in final paragraph ("content to share... question mark instead of a period") with felt loneliness reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors early (guardian, mind-garden, sleep breach); one tightening via restraint holds lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mind-garden mist and frozen tomes constrain tactics (interiorizing for control) and charge final shared-shadow image; sensory details (ozone fear-taste, pendant's cutting glow) filter through POV bias, mirroring internal ambiguity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guard vs. homesick curiosity) signaled early, texturally escalates via restraint choice narrowing predatory path; cost legible in coiled muscles and eased loneliness, charging poise without agency slip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from light-boundary conflict and final shared breath image reweighting isolation; resonant non-literal answer in "question mark instead of a period" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (liquid light nostalgia, ink-fur self) sustains rhythmic control through surreal compression; stable single POV with no leakage, voice modulating tension in low rumble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (mist as soul), but minor overwriting via metaphor density dulls peak restraint beat slightly; no loops, clean propulsion to foggy lucidity shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guardian predation and dimensional ache transforms library trope via interiorizing tactic and light-boundary premise; risk in surreal voice heightens stakes organically.</comment>
