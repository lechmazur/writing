<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in haunted memory of bleaching drives data assembly to revelation; interiority embodied in tapping and breath catching. Contradictory dismissal of "periodically eternal" resolves in earned realization. Final choice to trace road then gaze at hologram forecloses doubt with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: tapping data accumulates to hologram CR revealing coral fortress, reweighting erasure premise with undeniable conceptual cost in "path... claimed by the life that refused to end." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Lens holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's cramped bulkhead and holographic projector constrain tapping and scanning choices; ocean's "swollen, heavy mass" filters POV priorities. Sensory vibrations and holographic glow charge final image. Details evolve with assembly action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early in path disappearance; assembly deepens to rogue-wave realization narrowing doubt to awe. Agency in weaving data forces stance reconfiguration. Cost legible in reshaped abyss understanding charging hologram.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of death-rebirth emerges from bleaching memory, road consumption, to "periodically eternal" reprise without statement. Final image reweights loss as resurrection non-literally. Complexity in late-ban irony lingers without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with oceanic perceptual signature in "vibrations of the deep reverberate." Rhythm modulates from disciplined tapping to flickering reveal. Diction controlled, biased to coral witness priorities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; rhythm varies with scene urgency in "fingers flew... light sculpted." Minor figurative density ("rogue wave") purposeful, no loops or scaffolds dulling reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Super-coral erupting from highway transforms eco-loss trope into resurrection synthesis; "calcium-rich substrate" detail inevitable in hindsight. Risky CR heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
