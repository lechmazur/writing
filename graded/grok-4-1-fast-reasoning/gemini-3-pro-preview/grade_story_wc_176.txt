<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in past failures intensifies through micro-choices like coating the card and reconfiguring the rope, earning redemption; embodied emotion in "snowmelt ardor" thawing numbness. Minor slip in abstract epiphany phrasing ("operated in the clear, bright timeframe") slightly undercuts contradiction in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mold prep to aurora activation to pour, landing RR closure in ringing plate with emotional cost of burned original legible in "ghosts of the past into a fortress of permanence." Orientation anchored immediately; no penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum and aurora constrain choices (frosty rope demands "technically gentle" handling; open roof channels energy), charging final image; sensory hierarchy (vibrating air, pulsating heat) filtered through artisan POV. Micro-setting of workbench and crucible evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve memory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via mechanism activation narrowing failure risk, with agency in pour under celestial pressure; cost felt in sacrificed paper and past grief, charging closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-monument emerges organically from casting process and final ringing image reweighting ephemeral melody as eternal; no moralizing, ambiguity in "forgotten names" lingers with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (artisan's tactile focus on perforations, fibers); voice texture modulates rhythm from deliberate prep to urgent pour, diction controlled and biased toward material transitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "He poured the liquid metal... filling the empty space"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in climax ("sky seemed to tear open") purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax ritual with aurora furnace and punched-card memory transforms preservation trope; risk in geometric energy premise heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via artisan logic.</comment>
