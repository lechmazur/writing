<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as chaste rebel is concrete and intensifies through embodied pain ("shocks of cold pain racing up her arms"), compelling the climax pull; contradictory impulses subtle in hoarding intimacy yet releasing chaos. Final renunciation earned by prior defiance. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: approach → untangle → resistance/Magistrate notice → snap thread → DC shatter with cost (soul lobotomy risk, "failure meant a lobotomy of the soul"). Single scene, orientation anchored early ("Silver Courtyard," Elara's role). Closure cost legible in "twisted her wrist and pulled with all her might."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-biased: silence "felt violent," snow "undisturbed drifts" blasted at end charges closure. Prism/recurring snow constrain choice (barrier, cold pain) and mirror shift from serenity to chaos. For 9+: Prism as tool shapes final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse Harvest) signaled early, causal tightening via spell resistance/Magistrate gaze narrows options; agency in pull forecloses conformity path with pain cost. Escalation driven by her choices under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of withheld intimacy as defiance emerges organically: "hoarded" moments released in shatter, final image ("conductor of chaos") reweights premise without moral. Resonance from particulars like tangled conformity threads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature ("binding spell... like tangled yarn"); voice texture poetic/rhythmic ("robes trailing... like spilled ink"). No dialogue; compression purposeful, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density/varied rhythm propels (e.g., short climax sentences amid lyricism); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("breaking cello string"). Zero figurative muddle in peak ("thread snapped").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: courtesan untangles conformity via "frequency threads" in echo-Prism ritual; risk-taking in poetic fantasy prose heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from hoarding motif to release.</comment>
