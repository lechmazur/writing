<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover hidden patterns compels micro-choices like moon paths and whistle, earning final kinship; interiority particular via net-mender lens. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping serenity dominant over tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tea patterns to firefly sphere CR, reweighting chaos/order with exertion cost in "fleeting second" and "tiring insects." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting filters via POV (net metaphysics in weeps, wet stones); tea bowl as micro-setting charges closure by mirroring moon. Sensory selection purposeful, guiding paths to apex.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apprehend hidden patterns) tightens at whistle's sphere, narrowing chaos via agency; cost felt in momentary order amid tiring fireflies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of small efforts rippling order emerges organically via nets, bubbles, sphere; final tea image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (pattern-seeking); rhythmic prose modulates serene to charged poise at whistle, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel ritual; no loops or artifacts, figuratives integrate (e.g., "hexagonal formations"). Minor density in metaphors purposeful for texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net philosophy, firefly orchestration, tea ritual transforms meditative rite into proof; risk in lyric audacity pays off at sphere.</comment>
