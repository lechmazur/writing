<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel hush at climax; embodied strain ("lungs burned") grounds endurance with cost. Limited shown internal contradiction—impulses not acting simultaneously under pressure. Micro-choices like narrowing throat reveal values effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density swallows machine's accelerating whine to RR closure ("red lights... flickered and dissolved... prophecy... retreated"). Cost legible in "hands shaking from the metaphysical exertion" and sharper nostalgia. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via machine fight-back narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Saxophone's "cold brass" dewdrops constrain timing choice; fog and bioluminescent moss evolve to deepen shadows, charging final swirl. Sensory hierarchy (sonic voids over visuals) fits POV urgency. Details integrated via goal-directed play.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via machine's "whine" and pulse against hush density forces final throat-narrowing agency. One deepening forecloses completion with exertion cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silencing inevitable scream emerges organically via negative space vs. code; final "endless cycle... world that wanted to scream" offers resonant CR reweighting hush's pyrrhic victory. No moralizing; ambiguity in "grateful" fog lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature of sonic nostalgia; diction/rhythm modulate from thick buildup to raspy close ("wind dying in a chimney"). No head-hopping; voice texture misty and biased toward voids.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with pressure (short sealing whisper vs. building descriptions); high density in climax metaphors ("cage of pauses," "vested hush") coherent without muddle. Minor heaviness repetition ("heavy with moisture," "thick," "heavy sentiment") nudges down but doesn't obscure closure. Propulsion strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sax-silence dismantling code-prophecy transforms magical guardian trope; negative space hush inevitable in hindsight from alignment constraint. Risky sonic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
