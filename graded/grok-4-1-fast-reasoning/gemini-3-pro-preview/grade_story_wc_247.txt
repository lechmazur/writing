<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied joyful sorrow and micro-choices under pressure (sweating to frame crescendo) reveal character; advisor applies relevant pressure. Final realization of erasure as canvas earned via prior mapping process. Minor abstract epiphany phrasing ("poignant happiness") slightly dilutes contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from gestures to vibrating silence, culminating in CR where empty shutter birth song despite no film. Orientation anchored immediately (harbor, night). Cost legible in "weeping tears of joy" over forgotten self as necessary canvas.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent waves and rotting pier constrain framing against glowing horizon; moonlight pulses as rhythm section charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (cool air, lapping tide) reflects urgency. No white-room; lived-in choreography via panning camera.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, escalates via accumulative crescendo of frantic signs narrowing focus options. Agency in aperture adjustments and shutter snap forecloses with emotional cost (ache of anonymity). One decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of anonymity-as-liberation emerges organically from gestures and void-mapping; final CR reweights premise without moralizing. Resonant image of universe shuddering despite empty camera offers non-literal answer. Complexity in joyful sorrow avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature via camera lens isolating "frequencies of light and motion." Voice texture modulates rhythmically with intensity; whisper subtextual ("focus on the void"). No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short clicks amid swells). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("hands flying up like startled birds") coherent in lyric mode, no loops or muddle at closure. Strategic telling compresses process efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empty camera as silence-composer transforms sign language trope into textural symphony. Risky lyric conceit (no-film capture changes everything) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight payoff in eternal harbor song.</comment>
