<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied pain ("gnawing teeth-ache in his bones") and contradictory curiosity vs. conformity driving micro-choices like chemical timer over forbidden digital; endurance to capture earns final renunciation of colony warmth with felt cost. Flaw of poor conformism complicates via unauthorized risk without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to on-page Conceptual Repricing at shutter click and eternal light flare; cost legible in "the last true night the moon would ever know" crystallized in final image. Single scene anchors orientation early ("Tycho basin"); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting via pressure suit and summit dust constrains stillness against drones/cold, charging final "dawnlit melancholy" image; sensory hierarchy (eyes over radar) reflects priorities. POV-filtered details like "gray dust" integrate via action without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture vanishing dark) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via timer countdown and endurance, forcing trade-off (risk vs. retreat); cost visible in physical shiver and permanent light banishment. Agency via stillness/outlasting coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of natural beauty vs. industrial sterility emerges via particulars like chemical timer and sand grain, resonant in final image reweighting progress as loss without moralizing; subtext in "efficiency algorithms could never process" lingers via ambiguity of Elias's isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (lyric-technical diction like "razor-thin line of diamond-white light"); rhythmic modulation builds to hush's compression; no dialogue, purposeful elision of colony backstory anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chemical strip advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm peaks at "horizon ignited" without loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in metaphors ("bath of artificial sodium light") purposeful for textural lens, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar industrialization with lyric loss via chemical timer/sand grain transforming "last night" trope; risk in solo endurance heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via curious trait driving closure image.</comment>
