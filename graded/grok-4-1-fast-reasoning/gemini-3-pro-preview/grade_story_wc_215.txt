<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of contradictory amazement and tranquility in "astonished recluse who finds the sheer audacity of the afterlife perpetually shocking," compelling the pivotal refusal of the ghost's plea with earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably; Charged Poise closure lands vividly in the ghost's wavering and covenant tightening ("her form wavered, and the urgency drained"), with felt cost in Elias's held breath and nightly ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Scorched apiary micro-setting constrains ritual choices (supers as altar, light on glass shards), charging final image; perceptual filter via contextual clues like "slump of their shoulders" anchors POV specificity without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving covenant vs. ghostly confessions) tightens texturally via ghost's approach and gaze-forced retreat, with agency in refusal/endurance foreclosing validation path; cost legible in drained urgency and Elias's anchoring burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken profundity emerges organically from ritual refusals, resonating in final ghosts-as-statues image ("heavy and golden like honey sealed") that reweights revelation's cheapness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (contextual ghost-reading, shadow refraction); rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual's compression, eliding noise for legible silence payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration, though minor figurative density in ritual beat ("riot of cobalt, crimson, and amber") borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible ghosts, apiary wasteland, and silence philosophy transforms tropes; stained-glass ritual from bullet lead risks boldly, heightening stakes in covenant re-tying.</comment>
