<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Deaf music teacher's tactile navigation and ritual choices reveal specific flaws like numbness-induced stasis, culminating in earned shift to "raw, aching sorrow" with embodied tears and gasp. Contradictory impulses surface in trembling hand against resolute pressing of palms. Final readiness feels compelled by prior tactile buildup without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of vibrations builds to filament snap as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting numbness with sorrow's cost in "The numbness was gone, replaced by... beautifully alive." Single scene anchors orientation early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cavern's moss-muting and drum skins constrain to tactile ritual, charging closure via "hand on the nearest drum, feeling the lingering warmth." Sensory hierarchy biases to vibration; details evolve with friction, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness defeat) signaled early; textural escalation via grinding to "threatened to enthrall," narrowing to snap with legible sorrow cost. Agency in rigging/inverting ritual drives deepening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of tangible silence emerges via filament image shifting from chaos to snap, reweighting reversal's premise in final "wind changing direction." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like jagged needle's gouge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with tactile perceptual signature ("tactile geometry of vibration"); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to tremor without distance slips. Voice texture fits deaf focalizer's bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short gasps amid long builds); high density integrates action/image, but minor figurative density in "filament of hush" buildup borders overwrite without muddle. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, reverse ritual, and drum resonance transforms apathy trope into tactile hush premise; risk in poetic vibration focus heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via needle's gouge.</comment>
