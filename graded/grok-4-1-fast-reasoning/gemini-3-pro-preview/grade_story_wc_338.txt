<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in "methodically curious" trait drives precise, empathetic choices; embodied emotion peaks in "channeling the silent woman's sorrow," earning the closure act. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, tilting toward competence over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to DC closure as flagstones spiral, with legible cost in precise emotional mimicry ("rain dripping from her fingertips"). Orientation anchored early in vault/henge; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain-scoured frescoes and henge shadow constrain choice by hiding/eroding the lever, charging final image; sensory details (damp chill, stale air) filter through map-framer's perceptual bias. Micro-setting (western wall depression) guides action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen chapel) signaled early, escalates via footage discrepancy tightening to empathetic pressure point; agency in "leaning pressure, mimicking the posture" forecloses force option under Accumulative lens. One deepening reweights with felt precision cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bridging silence/erosion emerges organically from map tear to "repairing the tear with understanding"; final image reconfigures past/present without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in border/noticing motifs ("what was excluded from the frame"); rhythmic diction modulates from setup to charged climax. No head-hopping or withholding; voice coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion; minor scaffold in opening traits ("methodically curious") but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Figuratives purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forensic footage/empathy mechanism transforms trope discovery; risk in non-violent "approached it as one would a frightened animal" heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
