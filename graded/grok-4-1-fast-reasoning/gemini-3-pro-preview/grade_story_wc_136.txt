<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "heart hammered... trembling certainty," driving earned closure revelation of mapping as frailty defense; no unearned epiphanies, all embodied and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density from cracks to punched steps to jar shatter; CR closure legible with conceptual cost in "integrating the fractured parts," oriented early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cracks, fog, and phantom punch constrain choices (arrows direct, punch creates path); starlit vault charges final image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific (geometric fissures over skyline).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach fortress) tightens via chasm dare narrowing options under textural lens; agency in sequential punches forecloses gravity/logic path, cost felt in trembling resolve charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed truths emerges via jar's frailty admission reweighting mapping obsession; resonant CR ending image avoids moralizing, complexity in obsession's defensive cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (fissures as "deliberate, geometric beauty"); rhythmic control modulates from scanning to ascending, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory/action lines; minor figurative density in vault description ("constellations of cold light") without muddle or loops, rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban cracks as metaphysical arrows to mist-vault punch mechanics transforms surreal navigation trope; risk in impossible staircase heightens stakes organically to CR payoff.</comment>
