<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied emotions like heart hammering and tempered triumph; micro-choices with watch and glances reveal competence balanced by struggle. Contradictory terror/thrill impulses act in scene, earning exit with notebook cost. Minor stock phrasing ("heart hammered") slips but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via deciphered phrases, pattern break at watch warnings, CR closure in notebook's wet ink reweighting unspoken truths with trap-risk cost. Orientation anchored early; persistent watch constraint shapes tactics to charged exit image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (hum, hot watch, groaning walls) constrain choices like peripheral glimpses and anticipating floor; mist library and shifting panels charge final burst-through image. POV-biased noticing of geometry reflects dreamer's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher/exit) tightens via cycle inversion and final click, narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in delay method forecloses trap path with felt cost in hurried documentation. Escalation driven by her endurance, cost unmistakable in "turning back toward the mist."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths emerges via transcribed fragments ("silence is a vessel," "truth decays"); final notebook image offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like afterimage phrases build complexity organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with dreamer's perceptual signature in geometric patterns and lag perceptions; rhythmic prose modulates tension purposefully. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits veiled dreamer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak ("bruised purple") coherent and pattern-supported, not muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-reality library with time-cheating watch transforms tropes; surreal risks heighten stakes via cipher constraints, inevitable in hindsight at ink-proving closure.</comment>
