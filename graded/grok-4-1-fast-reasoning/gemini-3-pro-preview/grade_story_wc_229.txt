<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in years under boss's doctrine intensifies compellingly to vial use; embodied "screaming tenderness" as chest wound reveals contradictory impulses in climax projection. Head keeper one-note and passive, but doesn't touch closure agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of intent/scent builds to RR closure as ship turns via projected whisper, with legible emotional cost in shaking body; single scene anchors early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt tiles, gallery wind, and mist constrain projection choice and charge final ship shadow image; sensory hierarchy (scent piercing brine) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers save ship) signaled early tightens via peaking projection effort under textural lens, foreclosing shout option with embodied cost; agency in scent-push drives closure turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of intent's quiet power emerges organically via vial-to-scent arc, resonating in final "quietest force had screamed the loudest" without moralizing; reweights boss doctrine implicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (vibrations over sound); rhythmic prose modulates to short, intense sentences in projection peak, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "impossible scent of a garden at night spilled out"); no loops or artifacts, rhythm varies purposefully in climax without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of lighthouse tropes with intent-vibrations vial transforms premise; risk in subtle projection payoff feels inevitable from early secret motivation.</comment>
