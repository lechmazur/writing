<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eccentric keeper's interiority shines in embodied compulsion ("burning motivation," trembling fingers) and micro-choice to probe gaps despite corruption, earning final endurance of burden; minor diagnostic summaries ("profound truths of the human heart") slightly abstract peak realization without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of memory fragments builds to Conceptual Repricing closure—realizing "love that required no presence," reweighting isolation—with legible cost in "heavy burden" borne with grace; single scene anchors orientation early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist constrain choices (sitting over void heightens fragility) and charge final image (dock fades); sensory hierarchy (humming light, swirling vapor) reflects keeper's perceptual bias, evolving causally with twilight's end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) signaled early tightens via agency-driven focus on gaps, escalating hum and fractured vision to foreclose discard option; cost felt in sacrificed presence, though internal pressure dominates without external reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of love in voluntary absence emerges organically from gaps imagery, culminating in resonant final image ("vast, quiet spaces between people") that reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity of ghost's sacrifice invites lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (ink-stained eccentricity, time-illuminating lens) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, stable close third-person POV with clean free indirect access; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated sensory propulsion; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("fractured panorama," "grey entropy") risks coherence in peak memory beat, but pattern-taught lyricism sustains ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-objects archive and gap-observation transforms memory trope into selfless love revelation; risk-taking in surreal setting (solidified light dock) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
