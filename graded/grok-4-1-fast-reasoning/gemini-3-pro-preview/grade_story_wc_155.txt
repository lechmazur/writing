<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly from initial frustration with mist-obscured creation to pensive mirth in the fading cathedral, earning the final endurance of joy with embodied cost in loosened anxiety and breathless laughter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density build from tactile anchor to holographic resurrection, landing CR closure in "beautiful futility of art that exists only for a moment inside a dream" with legible conceptual cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog as photosensitive emulsion constrains painting choice and charges final fading image; sensory details (wet stone, ghostly sweetness) filter through artist's priorities, evolving causally with light trails.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy escalates accumulatively via network-deepening that narrows random strokes to structured dance, forcing trade-off of temporary triumph with visible cost in blurring edges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of creation's reward despite futility emerges organically from light-orchard overlay to dissolving glow, offering resonant non-literal answer in chuckle at impermanence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (irony of creator in obscuring world, prismatic glow trails); rhythmic prose modulates from heavy-eyed drift to breathless laughter under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (fog as emulsion, light as welding torch) propels without muddle; minor register elevation in "holographic resurrection" slightly drifts but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-painting via film-exposed fog and root-network transforms artist-daydream trope; risk of impermanent light-cathedral heightens stakes organically to charged CR.</comment>
