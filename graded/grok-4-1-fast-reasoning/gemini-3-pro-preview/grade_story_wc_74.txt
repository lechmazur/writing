<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in concrete memory of bread and syllable compels ritual; embodied exhaustion (bruised eyes, tremors) contradicts hope, acting simultaneously in steady-hand painting. Final relief and sleep earn change with visible cost. Minor lack of overt internal contradiction during climax prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual setup through memory-deepening to light-flicker RR (Charged Poise), reconfiguring isolation with felt cost ("tremors... settled," brush dims). Orientation anchored early (rooftop greenhouse, Orelia smog). Persistent constraint (moonlight finitude) shapes tactics and closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (painter notes ferns, condensation); greenhouse/smoke duality constrains canvas (glass pane) and charges final beacon. Micro-setting (workbench, brush) guides ritual choices. Waxing moon pierces haze, mirroring internal reconnection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection via lost symbol) signaled early, deepens texturally via memory-cadence shift narrowing doubt; agency in ritual forecloses isolation with on-page cost (exhaustion yields to sleep). Light response as tightening under Accum lens. Quiet stakes slightly abstractify visceral price at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (kindness endures lost tongues) emerges via bread-memory particular to glowing ideogram; final skyline beacon non-literally answers without moralizing, reweighting cynicism. Subtext in silent signal spans ravine. No tidy binary, embraces decay's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with painterly perceptual signature (bristles "drink" moonlight, ideogram "burning"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in ritual ("traced... rhythmic"), breathes in saffron quiet. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/ritual advance (e.g., "bristles... shimmered with... ethereal fire"); varied rhythm, no loops. Purposeful figuration (smog "erased history") coherent, peaks clean. Minor overwriting in metaphors slightly dulls one mid-ritual beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moon-tipped brush painting extinct ideograms to signal kindness transforms isolation trope organically; fresh synthesis (language as light-bridge) risks lyric magic-realism, heightens stakes via smog constraint. Inevitable hindsight: response recharges urchin memory.</comment>
