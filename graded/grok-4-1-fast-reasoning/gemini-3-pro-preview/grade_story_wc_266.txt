<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Man's arc from huddled bitterness ("I left nothing but fear") to purposeful claim shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, embodied in trembling and hollow chest; earned by Elara's guidance and star touch. Elara particular via centuries-empathy and tool-use, but archetypal wise-guide limits to very strong. Closure choice motivated by prior micro-choices like refusing gaze then touching star.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via spiral path, ticket punch, vigil to CR closure where man pulls will from mist, reweighting leash premise with cost in "legs trembling." Orientation anchored in first para (Elara helm, man passenger, Ridgeway). One tightening via station approach suffices; no causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty Ridgeway, thermal drafts, abyss constrain indirect route and charge final "misty stones" step-off; sensory hierarchy (salt mist taste, heartbeat tap) reflects guide urgency. Body/tool (ticket punch, star) as micro-setting narrows perception purposefully. No white-room; evolves causally to oceanic waves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim abandoned courage post-leash) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to vigil deepening and star-touch reversal narrowing options; agency in purposeful reach forecloses fear-path with felt cost ("settling shaking hands"). Pressure coheres under lens without coincidence resolution; one turn at station suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (freedom as painful self-standing) emerges via leash-root image shifting ("not holding back; holding up") to CR final pull without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in waves washing panic, reweighting prior spiral. Complexity in counter-reading fear-as-strength lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited (man's shiver to Elara's watch) with perceptual bias (refusing horizon); voice rhythmic/perceptual signature in "cloudy cobblestones," modulates to lullaby cadence under deepening. Dialogue subtextual ("Not just fear"), goal-driven; no head-hopping, elision none.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short punch "click" amid long waves); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs—mist "trails like severed root" coherent. Closure image ("weight like resolved will") vivid, zero artifacts; read-aloud oceanic flow matches tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: psychic-leash metaphor to courage-pool Ridgeway transforms ferry trope organically, risk in allegorical spiral pays off at mist-pull CR. No template echoes; bold indirect-path frame heightens stakes inevitably. Transformation test passes—names/settings integral to rule-set.</comment>
