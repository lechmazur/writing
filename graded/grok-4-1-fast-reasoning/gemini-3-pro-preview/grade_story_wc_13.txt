<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in illustrator's drive intensifies via time-borrow cost, compelling climb and sketch; embodied aging ("hands wrinkled slightly, and a streak of white hair") earns endurance with visible price on pivotal escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pendant activation → frozen time → spire reach → uncaging → sketch → stasis crack with groan, landing CR closure in final sketch/escape image where cost ("aged weeks in minutes") reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and spire constrain via ripples/shudders, charging climb and escape; frozen "water droplets hung suspended like diamonds" mirrors internal stasis, evolving causally to churning tide in final surge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture echo pre-wake) tightens causally via pendant use and "geological shudder," forcing uncaging agency; cost unmistakable in "hands wrinkled" amid expiring hour, charging escape image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art's temporal theft emerges via echo-as-entity sketch, reweighted in silent "masterpiece from oblivion" without moralizing; final image answers want-vs-cost non-literally, resonant with prior pendant trade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with illustrator's perceptual bias (visualizing "anatomy of the sound"); rhythmic diction modulates to frantic "hand flying across the textured paper" under peak stress, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("world turned grayscale and still"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (echo "shimmering, translucent entity"), climax clear without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of giant-city, time-pendant, echo-illustration transforms fantasy tropes organically; risk in imperfect magic ("magic was imperfect against...scale") heightens stakes to inevitable CR payoff.</comment>
