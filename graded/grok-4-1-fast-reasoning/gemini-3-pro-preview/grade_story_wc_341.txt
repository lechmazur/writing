<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to prove empty spaces remember drives consistent micro-choices like logging and sketching, embodied in cold metal and tears; interiority particular via emotional cloud categorization. Minor slip: realization lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, leaning toward tidy epiphany at vision loop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from resentment cloud to spooled wholeness vision, landing CR closure in sketch as proof with sorrow's cost; orientation anchored para 1, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brass telescope constrains vision choice and charges final sketch image; sensory details (shimmering atmosphere, rattling teeth) selective via POV bias, sky gondola lived-in with riveted hull casting shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove theory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Nimbus to loop vision tightening desperation into purpose; agency in persistent observation yields felt emotional cost in tears blurring vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved memories emerges via cloud emotions and loop of lost summer day, resonating in final library image reweighting drift without moralizing; subtext in psychic debris implicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in "clouds by emotion"; rhythmic diction modulates from melancholic drift to radiant terror, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; minor overwrite in peak metaphors ("oil on water," "spooled wholeness") coherent but thickens vision beat slightly without obscuring closure sketch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional meteorology and memory coils post-tether snap feels inevitable in vision loop; risk in psychic clouds transforms drift trope organically.</comment>
