<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied grief as "ache in his chest" mirrors the hand's spin, compelling micro-choices like ear-tuning amid quake; contradictory impulses to stop vs. align culminate in earned capture. Final endurance of pain as "permanent lantern" shows hierarchy of values with visible cost. Single-POV interiority particular and degraded under stress without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density of whir, vibration, quake builds to Charged Poise closure where "wisp" release captures flash with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Spire, Elian repairing for Green Flash). No lens ambiguity; one tightening via failed *click* to success narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thin air "tasting of ozone," workbench jars rattling constrain choices during quake; camera chassis as micro-setting charges final raise to aperture. Sensory hierarchy (ear over sight for tuning) reflects expertise. Details evolve causally (tools sliding to hatch) without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture millisecond flash) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven tuning attempts (*click* failure forces retry) under Accum lens with density shift to "wisp." Cost unmistakable in persistent ache post-success, foreclosing linear time fix. Quake complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "physics of longing" emerges via particulars: runaway hand mirrors grief, resolved non-literally in glowing ache as lantern. Final image reweights ephemeral capture without moral. Subtext in "trap for a moment that refused to be caught" invites ambiguity on harnessing vs. acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("frequency so high it appeared motionless"); diction like "luminous ache" modulates rhythm under quake stress. Minimal dialogue ("It wants to leave") natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; compression taught early, legible at "wisp" payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines like "sang a note of pure, luminous ache" advance texture/character without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies (short quake bursts to fluid adjustments); metaphors coherent (leaf friction threshold). No figurative muddle in peak (*click* to *wisp*).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesis of camera repair as sagecraft against lunar quake transforms trope of futile capture; "align with it" turn inevitable from "physics of longing." Bold lyric sci-fi risks (ear-tuning chaos) heighten closure without gimmickry. Irreplaceable: leaf sound as memory weight.</comment>
