<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in bloodhound past, with trembling hands and sealed hope embodying contradictory despair/endurance; micro-choice to overlay leaf earns final rest, foreclosing death-tracking path with felt years-long cost. Contradictory impulses act in honed visual skill vs. useless senses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; orientation anchored in first paragraph; closure as Charged Poise lands decisively in "distance... collapsed... close enough to touch," reconfiguring separation with conceptual cost of fragile hope, constraint of relic shaping every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Scrapyard/wasteland constrains via scavenged cylinder and amber shard, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (olfactory ruin to visual grooves) mirrors POV bias perfectly, with wind's "wild hush" evolving to "pregnant" silence. Amber lens as micro-setting enables pivotal decoding choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (closeness from distance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via riddle-to-frequency deepening driven by Silas's agency; cost unmistakable in "trembled from something other than cold" and sealed hope against despair, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of death-tracking to life-voice emerges organically from particulars (graves to grooves, leaf to frequency); final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting silence as promise, with ambiguity in "ghosting over him" lingering without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (visual topography over lost smell); rhythmic control modulates from predatory wind to crystallized poise, prose as character in "spinning ghost of a voice"; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (grooves as "landscape," silence "pregnant") without muddle, propelling to closure; overwriting absent, every line advances revelation under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of visual groove-reading, leaf-key cipher, post-war relic in single scene feels inevitable; bold poetic voice transforms tropes (wasteland loner) via specific decoding risk, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
