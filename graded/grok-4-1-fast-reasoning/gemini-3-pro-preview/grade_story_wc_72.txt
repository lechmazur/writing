<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's shift from "murder" certainty to caressing the ampoule earns her change through embodied contradiction and micro-choices under pressure. Caelum's motivation roots in consistent guardian traits, with incisively kind telepathy forcing her nuance without safety-hedging. Final swim to dais forecloses accusation path with felt responsibility cost. Status dynamics legible in his pedestal descent pressuring her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: secret reveal → correction → threading vine → translucent arch/sarcophagus → garden veins ignite → Elara's judgment fractures → decisive swim to break ampoule. Closure as Decisive Change on-page with conceptual cost of traded certainty for responsibility legible in "ready to trade her simple accusation for a complex responsibility." Orientation anchors early in ocean pressure and plaza. Single scene fits defaults, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater garden specifics (groaning tides, coral masonry, bioluminescent vine) constrain choices like threading fracture and reveal internals via mirrors. Sensory hierarchy narrows to pressure, bubbles, vibrations under crisis; final swaying garden charges closure image as expectant nursery. Body/suit (regulator gasp, tank stale) and recurring statues mirror internal shift from dead to alive. No white-room; coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (judgment of murder vs. mercy) signaled early, tightens causally via vine action/revelations narrowing certainty options. Agency in Elara's loosening grip and swim forecloses accusation with responsibility trade-off cost. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution; one reversal sufficient. Moral calculus peaks in "poison was the cure" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of nuance in certainty emerges organically from foxglove repricing (weapon to catalyst) and stone shift (tomb to vault). Subtext in Caelum's "we became the vault" and Elara's fracturing judgment invites ambiguity without tidy moral. Final image of expectant silence reweights premise with sacrifice cost, inextricable from arc. No direct statements; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV on Elara; perceptual bias filters stone eyes as "blank yet perceiving." Telepathic dialogue natural/subtextual, advances plot with goal pursuit ("It was mercy"). Prose rhythm modulates (short gasps amid fluid descriptions); diction controlled, no head-hopping. Voice distinct: Elara's thoughts blunt, Caelum's resonant ancient.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (chisel fingers nimble; slow deliberate swim); high density in revelation cascade. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("sea fans waved frantically like misplaced lungs") but purposeful, no muddle or loops touching closure. Strong verbs/specifics propel; no scaffolds, clean grammar. Final line's "pulse to return" recharges motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stony slumber via foxglove/apocalypse wait transforms tropes organically. Vine-threading through fracture as keyhole turn inevitable from setup. Bold underwater garden of animate statues risks surrealism but coheres via causal logic. No derivatives; premise commits to implications without retreat.</comment>
