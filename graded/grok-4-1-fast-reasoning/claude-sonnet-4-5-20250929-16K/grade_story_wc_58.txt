<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Marina's shift from documenting endings to mapping healing, earned through her vivid projections that still Thomas's hands; final choice to remain feels motivated by prior micro-choices like taking his hand. Voice distinction clear in dialogue idioms. No diagnostic speak or tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to shared realization, with Charged Poise closure in Thomas holding thread as compass and Marina's deliberate stay—cost legible in "having missed the last ship deliberately." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's bronze leaves and decay constrain intimacy on bench, mirroring carpet pattern to charge final image of transformation; sensory hierarchy (camphor, decay) reflects weaver's priorities. Micro-setting (thread/leaves) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding absences/healing) tightens accumulatively via Marina's descriptions forcing Thomas's stillness and wet eyes, narrowing to stance crystallization; agency in projecting presence forecloses "ending" path with emotional cost in vulnerability. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from explained absences to healing's topography, resonant in final garden image reweighting premise without moralizing; crimson leaf as shifting motif charges closure non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (e.g., "projecting presence like a medium"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing voices. Rhythmic modulation under intimacy; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances via image/action; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent and purposeful (leaves as "falling thread"), enhancing without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituaries-for-living premise transformed through weaver's thread and healing geography; risk in poetic intensity heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via garden-carpet echo.</comment>
