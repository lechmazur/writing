<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in father's hand lingering on gun before sheathing, earning his kneeling choice with relational cost; Mara's perceptual trait drives micro-choices like reading plants' reactions. Distinct voices in sparse dialogue reveal values hierarchy. Final teaching moment forecloses violent path visibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from arrival tension to pattern break at sheathing/kneling; closure as Charged Poise in final image reconfigures violence-to-gentleness with felt cost of past renounced. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome and roses constrain choices (petals curl from father) and charge final glow image; ballast scraps tactilely integrate via pressing into soil. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's priorities. Micro-setting as dome's atmosphere mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gentleness vs. violence signaled early, tightens via gun-hand progression to sheathing renunciation; agency in father's deliberate sheathe forecloses violent option with visible cost. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-chaos emerges via plant inculcation and father's arc, resonating in final image of roses leaning toward both without moral state. Particulars like canvas scraps reweight premise organically. Subtext in silences and gestures avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Mara's biased perceptual signature (tasting storms, reading shadows); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing rough father from quiet Mara. Rhythmic control modulates tension, prose as character in lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening ("held breath") purposeful for tone. Propulsion clear through action integration, closure image sharp.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tower wasteland with value-imparting roses transforms tropes; father's killer-to-gardener turn inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes via quiet dome crucible.</comment>
