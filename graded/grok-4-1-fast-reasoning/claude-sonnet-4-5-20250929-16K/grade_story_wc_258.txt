<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear motivation in Mira's curiosity drives confiding and work, shown through micro-choices like pulling the journal, but embodied emotions remain intellectualized without deep contradiction; internal conflict mild, more expository than visceral under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building pattern density from cards to wall-threads to journal to rain image; CR closure in final rain paths reconfigures inherited puzzle with conceptual cost of perpetuity; oriented early in loft scene, one tightening via confiding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain skylight and workbench constrain choices (e.g., tape across card, threads trembling) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy vivid via Mira's pattern bias, mirroring internal patterns without overt symbolism; micro-setting as recurring rain/tools elevates specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping patterns to predict crashes signaled early, tightens accumulatively via grandmother's inheritance and digital extensions; cost felt in ongoing "puzzle a little further along," but stakes abstract, lacking visceral on-page trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mutable cultural geometries emerges organically from measurements, threads, crashes; final rain image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting human nature's "immutable" laws through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person on Mira with perceptual signature (pattern-obsessed noticing); dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Tobias's admiration advances revelation); rhythmic control modulates from calm explanation to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., rain drumming "rhythms that seemed almost deliberate" advances atmosphere/plot); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor telling in expo but woven propulsively, clear to read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy as mechanical pattern-mapping predicts markets via golden ratio; transforms tropes through grounded specifics like ink/tape/wall, with risk-taking in conceptual premise heightening stakes ingeniously.</comment>
