<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in historian's traits; emotionally rational nature shown via trembling hands yet decisive micro-choices like photographing the manuscript. Earned renunciation of career with felt cost aligns with prior suppression parallel. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from discovery to CR closure; career sacrifice cost legible in "Her career at the state archives would end." Orientation anchored early at station. Single scene causality intact, no shards or disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rosebush petal bookends charge final image as beginning after ending, constraining reflective stance; ivy "brushing her shoulders like fingers from the past" mirrors thematic recapture. Sensory details (broken glass crunch, pigeons scattering) filtered through historian's eye, vivid and purposeful. 9+ test met via recurring object in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early, tightens via manuscript parallel deepening knowledge and narrowing to career-cost decision under Accumulative lens. Agency in photographing/wrapping forecloses safe path. Escalation coherent without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from Brother Aldric's text paralleling Council censorship, resonant CR in final mirror glance reweighting history's pattern without moralizing. Subtext in rosebush shift from ending to beginning avoids tidy binaries. 9+ test: non-literal answer via image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (noting Aldric's hand, petal detail); syntax modulates from descriptive to charged resolve. No dialogue or head-hopping. Diction controlled, historian's lexicon consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds despite reflective blocks. Minor paraphrase in parallel-drawing lines ("truth was dangerous, so authority must recapture") but anchored to present cue. Propulsion strong to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medieval/modern censorship via solo historian's epiphany transforms trope organically. Risk in internal-drive closure heightens stakes without gimmick. Station's patient secret feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
