<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots deeply in grandmother's erasure, shown through intuitive searching and embodied reactions like throat tightening; final drafting choice earns closure via prior discoveries. Contradictory impulses act in scene as doubt yields to crystallized resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: market acquisition accumulates to workshop revelations tightening knowledge toward CR closure in dawn realization and lens reflection. Orientation anchors by para 2; cost legible in Guild confrontation risk via "drafting her presentation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Market platforms and workshop desk constrain choices (trailing stalls to lens, holding fragment to paintings); recurring lens charges final image with grandmother's smile. Sensory details filter via Mira's translator bias, vivid yet selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover grandmother's history) signaled early, deepens via layered symbols narrowing to Guild challenge; agency in lens use and drafting forecloses denial with felt institutional cost. One tightening via final painting suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of translation as voice recovery emerges from particulars like hidden symbols and erased faces; final lens reflection reweights premise non-literally, charging "nothing truly disappears" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (symbols "flicker between visibility and absence"); brief dialogue natural/subtextual, merchant's knowing smile advances stakes. Rhythmic control modulates to crystalline poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short urgent sentences in revelations), propulsion peaks in "unfastening each hidden layer." Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical markets, perceptual translation via paintings/lens transforms trope of lost artifact into history-recovery map; risk in Guild confrontation feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
