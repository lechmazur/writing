<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic embodiment roots motivation in consistent traits; shift from applause-hunger to life-changing encore earned via song's contradictory echoes of triumph/regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as echoes multiply density toward Charged Poise; coin settling on Star crystallizes timeline braiding with eternal-haunting cost legible in final smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard's silver apples and fractured branches constrain temporal navigation; multi-decade blossoms in final image charge closure reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to save young man's ash-despair deepens via braided visions narrowing grey futures; her song-agency forecloses inaction with implied ongoing isolation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Performance-transcending-death theme emerges from coin/song particulars; Star image non-literally reweights haunting as resilient hope without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("silver hummed with hope") biases noticing; rhythmic echoes modulate voice intensity cleanly in single stable POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density synesthetic lines propel without loops; varied rhythm in song beat ("echoes that rippled... multiplied") avoids artifacts touching closure blossoms.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia-fueled temporal orchard braids ghost-agency premise non-obviously; echo-risk heightens stakes in timeline synthesis inevitable at coin's Star resolution.</comment>
