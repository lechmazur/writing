<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied preemptive nostalgia driving urgent measurements amid storm flashes; contradictory impulses (desperation vs. acceptance of impermanence) act simultaneously in her work. Davin applies brief relational pressure via dialogue that sharpens her philosophy. Final endurance of transformative memory earns closure with felt cost in fading notebook.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shadow measurements through storm intensification to CR closure in "remembering remembering," reweighting memory as process with impermanence cost legible in softening fog and full notebook. Single scene oriented early (observatory, forecourt by para 2). No orientation debt; lens taught immediately via whispers and shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stormlit crystals and shadows constrain choices (reveal palimpsests only in lightning), charging final image of listening amid hush; sensory hierarchy (whispers, ripples) filters through Maris's archival bias. Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archiving unstable memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via storm density and fog softening, forcing endurance with cost in temporary truths ("writing that would fade"). Agency in persistent measurements amid contradictions; micro-turn in dialogue deepens without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory as negotiation/performance emerges organically from fragment contradictions and shadow work, resonating in final CR image that reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in whispers (lullabies, grief) layers complexity; no tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers in performed recollections.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited to Maris's perceptual signature (shadow angles, crystal hums); voice modulates lyrically with storm rhythm. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("sculpting identity"), distinguishes Davin idiomatically; no head-hopping, compression purposeful in peak flashes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sense/action (e.g., "measuring cord pulled taut" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm breathes with hush/thunder; zero loops, no figurative muddle—metaphors (fog as muscle) consistent/voice-bound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of solid fog, summer-quill pages, shadow palimpsests transforms memory trope into urgent, impermanent archive; risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via storm constraint. Final CR feels inevitable from conjectural fragments; no derivative echoes.</comment>
