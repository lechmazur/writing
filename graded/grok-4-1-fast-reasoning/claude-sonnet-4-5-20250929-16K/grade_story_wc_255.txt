<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's colorblind texture-focus drives micro-choices like plant coding and reed demo, earning Fen's vase reveal; contradictory impulses in Fen's "games" resistance yield to barter with visible cost of forsaking perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: plant/reed setup accumulates to Fen's emergence, paintings demo, and barter DC/RR; cost legible in "beautiful failures" commitment and sprig image reconfiguring rebirth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard plants constrain communication, charge sprig closure; ash-dusk textures mirror imperfection theme via Mira's gray-scale bias, integrating sensory hierarchy without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to awaken Fen via imperfection tightens accumulatively through reed sound and vase reveal, narrowing perfection path; agency in barter forecloses old ways with courtyard-filling cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Twisted vase and sprig non-literally resolve "perfection as cage," reweighting phoenix motif organically from particulars; subtext in flawed reed sound avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature via texture/shadow filters ("gray world," swirls traced); dialogue subtextual ("games" lacks conviction) advances under distinct voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels reed para rhythmically; zero loops/artifacts, varied syntax integrates image/action cleanly to closure sprig.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plant-language barter synthesizes phoenix rebirth into imperfection awakening non-obviously; risks colorblind POV transforming mentor trope via texture specificity.</comment>
