<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the pivotal regrets wave ("backlash of regrets hit her then"), earning the final paddling choice with embodied cost of lost years; interiority concrete via navigational flaws and micro-choice to pocket compass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective images densify to Charged Poise closure ("She paddled north... brave enough to leave") with legible cost in current's risk and past anchor; orientation anchored early (kayak launch, fog); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Utility poles and broken compass recur as micro-settings constraining metaphorical choice and charging final sentinel image against sky; sensory details (creaking dock, humming wires, fog like regret) selectively mirror internal gravitas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (realign to true north/James) signaled early via compass crack, tightens accumulatively through message and attendant's warning ("commit... get pushed back"), forcing agency in paddling with visible hesitation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect navigation/homeward pull emerges organically from compass fracture splitting light and poles' simple song, resonant final image reweighting regrets without moral; no thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with navigational perceptual signature (e.g., "fog roll across the water like regret made visible"); brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("North inlet?" as knowing nudge); rhythmic modulation under dawning pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel via navigational metaphors without muddle; minor figurative density in opening ("merrily melancholic") taught as pattern, but slight paraphrase loop in regrets wave nudges down; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Utility poles as childhood navigation transform regret trope into fresh, grounded idiom; synthesis of broken tools/gravitation feels inevitable, risking lyric over plot without gimmick.</comment>
