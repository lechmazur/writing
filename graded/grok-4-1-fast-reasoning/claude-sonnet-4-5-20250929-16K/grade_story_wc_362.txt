<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between skepticism and mystic pull, embodied in prism's warmth and frost reading; final inheritance of legacy earned via prior grief and observation. Micro-choices like softening vision reveal values under pressure. No safety-hedging; flaws drive the realization without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from prism pulse to frost patterns speaking, culminating in CR (assumptions shatter) with legible cost in darkened prism and inherited burden. Orientation anchored early (arbor, mist, morning). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost patterns as micro-settings constrain method and charge final image (stones remember, mist embraces); sensory selection (translucent columns refracting, jagged frost lines) POV-biased toward mystic reading. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove emotion absorption) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via prism-frost interaction narrowing skeptic-to-believer options; agency in placing prism forces trade-off with certainty. Cost felt in shattered assumptions and darkened prism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "truthful lies" emerges organically from mentor's whispers to final prism shapes; resonant CR reweights premise (objects remember) without moralizing. Final mist embrace answers central question via image, not statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (light bending as truth/revelation); rhythmic modulation builds to softened vision beat. Prose texture distinct, lyric without opacity; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs (short sentences in shattering moment); high density, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening ("skeletal cathedral") purposeful for accumulative tone, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic-mystic via frost/prism emotion-reading transforms pseudoscience tropes; premise follows implications boldly to CR without retreat. Risky lyric closure (mist as answer) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
