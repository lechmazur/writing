<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via acoustic perceptions rooted in family tradition; micro-choice to play fragments reveals contradictory embrace of incompleteness over resolution, earning final bowl placement with opportunity cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound density builds to Charged Poise closure; "hush began to break... loosened. Unbinding, thread by thread" delivers conceptual cost of release in legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse acoustics and shipwreck hum constrain playing choice and amplify stakes; water reflections and rust-to-gold final image charge closure under acoustic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hush as dominant stake signaled early escalates via deepening sound layers matching ships/bowl/drips; agency in fragmentary playing narrows to unfinished release with on-page hush-loosening cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges organically from playing fragments vs. trapped loops; final bowl "like a question with no answer" reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with acoustic perceptual signature; syntax/rhythm modulate from hushed entry to building crescendo, sustaining lyric texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with zero loops/artifacts; varied rhythm peaks in "sound bounced between water and glass," varying sentence openings for natural ear flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh acoustic hush post-rainforest transforms quiet apocalypse via unbinding fragments; lyric risk in sound motifs pays off inevitably in rust-to-gold reconfiguration.</comment>
