<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scavenging others' whispers to evade her own story, embodied in "Regret tasted like copper and cloud-water"; final hand-extension earns reconciliation with felt cost of eroded dreams, no diagnostic slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as whisper fragments and wheel discovery densify toward Charged Poise closure; ghost's "fingers brushed hers, solid and cool" delivers on-page reconfiguration with legible opportunity cost, orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lagoon's "silver waters churn above the cloudline" and mist-whispers constrain choices via thermal defiance and fragment collection; recurring wheel charges final image, mirroring internal erosion through purposeful sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling eroded ambitions tightens via wheel's clicks narrowing hesitation to hand-extension; agency in pocketing wheel and approaching ghost forecloses abandonment path with "blueprints reflected, eroded but still legible" cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hesitation's carousel vs lagoon's motion emerges organically from particulars, reweighted non-literally in ghost-hand brush offering "small gardens, perhaps"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in achievable modesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward "story-shards" and time-slips, rhythmic compression heightens under pressure; stable single-POV with purposeful elision pays off in closure image, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and zero loops; figurative layering like "chronology slipped through her fingers like lagoon water" coherent and pattern-taught, closure image crisp without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal kinetic lagoon and camera wheel synthesize regret trope into fresh Charged Poise via ghost negotiation; risk-taking in fractured-time lyricism heightens stakes inevitably toward "maybe that's enough to start again."</comment>
