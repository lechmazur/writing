<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Helix-minded trait consistently shapes perception and final choice to modify purpose, with embodied fear/anticipation in trembling hands creating contradiction under pressure; earned renunciation of original project's weapon potential via recursive memory loops; minor label-speak in "helix-minded" but shown through spiraling thoughts without therapy abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory layers densify to CR closure in "began... to make it whole," reweighting tech's purpose with her transformation cost legible in tangled strata; single scene anchored in first paragraph (Maya/canyon/moonlit); no orientation debt, pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon walls "like the curved interior of a skull" and mineral deposits constrain detection/shielding, charging final "ancient embrace" image; mirror fragments as micro-setting handled tactilely, narrowing perception during interface; sensory selection (moonlight on fractures) reflects urgency, integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavate/complete archive) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory flood that deepens to force purpose reconfiguration under lens; agency in placing mirror/interface forecloses abandonment path with tangled self-cost felt on-page; one tightening sufficient, charges poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming abandoned dreams emerges organically from musician/teacher/child visions shifting to renewal protocol, resonant non-literal answer in final spiral without moralizing; subtext in fractured mirror reweights "discarded... mattered more"; complexity in weapon potential vs. possibility lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with helix-biased perceptual signature (double/triple visions, recursive loops); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity in interface flood; purposeful compression of memory layers taught early, legible at CR closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cracks weren't damage; they were modification" advances plot/character/theme); varied rhythm, no loops obscuring closure; minor helix motif repetition pattern-taught, purposeful without muddle; strong verbs anchor pivotal interface beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oblique mirror observation and synaptic memory entanglement transforms sci-fi trope into helix-recursive arc, inevitable in hindsight via Keiko's buried strata; risk in solo transformative reverie heightens conceptual stakes; no derivative echoes, bold premise commitment.</comment>
