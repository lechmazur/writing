<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional character-particular interiority in geometric mapping and embodied reawakening; motivation from grandmother's legacy earns final notation, though contradictory impulses lean reflective over simultaneous action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to void discovery as CR closure; "Stories live in the curvature" reweights three-year effort with conceptual cost in legible final notation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library's eccentric collections and deepest-section isolation constrain mapping; scarf-anchored model's shadows charge final image, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping stories tightens via finger-traced voids as unmappable presences; agency in observation forecloses flat models, though external pressure remains subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final notation offers resonant answer to stories' dwelling without moralizing; theme emerges organically from analog artifacts and curvature, reweighting premise via scarf reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with geometric perceptual signature; rhythmic lyricism modulates from mapping to realization without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or muddled metaphors; hyperbolic imagery coheres purposefully in peak void beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry synthesis transforms librarian trope into fresh topology of stories; risk pays off in tactile, inevitable closure image.</comment>
