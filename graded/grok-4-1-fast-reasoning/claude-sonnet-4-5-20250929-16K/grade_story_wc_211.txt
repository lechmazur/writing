<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation to decode the prophecy intensifies through embodied trial (correct vs. accidental Etruscan), earning her shift from disquiet to transition with felt cost in the tree's longing; interiority particular via archival expertise and childhood cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (prophecy, foghorn, tree memory) tightens to CR closure when accidental recitation pulses bark, reweighting silence as transition with legible cost in lost soil longing; orientation anchored immediately, flashback shard interleaves cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard's skeletal branches and warm bark constrain choices (pressing hand activates memory) and charge final image ("hands smelling of ancient bark"); sensory selection (violet sky, silence weight) mirrors emotional shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode silence via prophecy) deepens via failed correct recitation then successful accidental one, narrowing options under textural lens; agency in placing wax forecloses foreboding with felt tree-longing cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emotions/patterns as prophecies emerges organically from child's error to tree's archived longing, resonating in non-literal final image of wax offering bridging dead tongues to new cycles without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (language tremors, bark pulse) stable and biased toward patterns; rhythmic control modulates from disquiet to charged poise without drift or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "bark seemed to pulse... wax grew warm"); varied syntax/rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "fruit-ghosts" integrate without muddle even in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rooftop orchard remembering harbor soil via Etruscan child's mispronunciation transforms prophecy trope; risk in nonlinear memory shard heightens inevitability of CR without gimmick.</comment>
