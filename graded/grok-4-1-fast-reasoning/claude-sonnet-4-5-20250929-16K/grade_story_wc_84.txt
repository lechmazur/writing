<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's sharp eyes and military backstory create embodied motivation tying her gaps to the chip's revelation, earning the closure choice; pilgrim applies light crucible pressure but lacks distinct voice or deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered discoveries (chip scan to drone data), yielding Charged Poise CR at "Now we send our own signal back" with emotional cost legible in tears and personal resonance; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dusk observatory and fractured dome constrain drone launch and charge final image of stars through opening; selective sensory details (glinting chip, radio whispers) mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding belonging tightens accumulatively through coordinate pulls revealing network, forcing stance crystallization in signal response; agency in drone programming carries felt emotional cost, though no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as cosmic resonance emerges from chip patterns and frequency echoes without statement; final drone ascent reweights "missing pieces" non-literally, inviting ambiguity on connection's voids.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable Mara-limited POV with perceptual bias (drone feeds, star alignments); rhythmic diction modulates from observational to charged ("signals sent into the void could find echo"); dialogue sparse, natural, subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image propulsion, varying rhythm; minor repetition of "perpetually surprised" and "brilliant dimness" borders loop but serves motif without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Type foundry chip as star-map encoder transforms printing relic into cosmic network key, synthesizing tech/ruins in fresh, inevitable hindsight; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
