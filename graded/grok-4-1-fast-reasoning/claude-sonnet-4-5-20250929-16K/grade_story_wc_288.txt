<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in avoiding yet confronting cartography maps brittle fear vs. independence drive; final sundial placement earns renunciation of escape with embodied cost of old-world facing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of realizations tightening to CR closure at map charting; sundial shadow causally anchors orientation early and pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atomically reflective floors constrain navigation as lived maps, charging final territory claim; thylacine howl and cloud tides tactilely mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of isolation-to-independence deepens accumulatively through tide survival to map confrontation, foreclosing flight with legible cost in "brittle awakenings."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coexistence theme emerges organically from extinct interactions and map lines, reweighted non-literally by sundial-at-center image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward photon mappings and hum navigation; rhythmic modulation from fractured memories to firm charting sustains single-POV intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density propulsion in photon/cloud images varies rhythm without loops; minor metaphor density purposeful, not muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation library with tidal extinctions risks surreal coexistence payoff, transforming tropes via sundial-map ingenuity.</comment>
