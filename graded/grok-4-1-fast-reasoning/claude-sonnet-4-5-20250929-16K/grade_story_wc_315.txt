<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (doubt via buckle-fumbling vs. duty in pattern-tracing) act simultaneously in the reading beat; final renunciation earned by muscle-memory confirmation and transparency choice with burden-cost foreclosed. Interiority concrete and embodied throughout. No diagnostic slips or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from doubt (council message) to pattern-emergence to stasis-closure in "Her fingers released the parachute buckle... Some burdens were meant to be carried," with legible endurance-cost. Orientation anchored by para 2. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor geometry constrains reading (e.g., "Three steps left, duck beneath the lowhanging bough"), body/attention (fingertips, buckle) charges final release image. Sensory selective via POV (silver leaves, bark-touch over visuals). Atmosphere mirrors internal rightness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust preservation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via pattern-confirmation tightening options to transparency vs. escape/contradiction; agency in endurance forecloses path with burden-cost on closure beat. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth via patient attention vs. feared doubt) emerges organically from pattern-work and buckle motif; final "leaves whispered agreements... she understood. This was exactly where she belonged" offers resonant reweighting without moralizing. Complexity in trust calculus lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (patterns as "soundless echo... reverberating through her bones"); rhythmic control modulates from attentive flow to pressured cadence in doubt beats. No elision or head-hopping; diction biased to tactile geometry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (e.g., multi-job sentences in tracing sequence advance action/character/atmosphere); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, precise verbs/nouns. No overwriting in peak reading beat; propulsion peaks crisply at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pattern-seer premise with floating arbor and muscle-memory reading transforms isolation trope; buckle-escape risk heightens internal stakes organically. No derivatives; bold solo-POV ingenuity pays in closure poise.</comment>
