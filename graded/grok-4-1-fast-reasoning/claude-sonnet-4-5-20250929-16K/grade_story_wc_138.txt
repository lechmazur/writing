<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory fear/hope impulses act simultaneously as she steps onto the beach, earning the final unafraid climb; interiority particular via fragment-enhanced glimpses of displaced souls. Boredom flaw drives eternal tedium into motivated chase with visible cost of leaving sanctuary. 9+ test met with on-page micro-choice hierarchy revealed in hesitation before stepping through.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of perceptions tightening to CR closure: final pull into space-between reconfigures immortality with conceptual cost of potential eternity's end. Orientation anchored early in escondite amid solar cycles. No lens ambiguity; persistent fragment constraint shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic walls and impossible beach constrain choices—eastern wall opens, sand hums with potential—forcing step through; 9+ test met as setting charges final image of shifting sanctuary. Sensory hierarchy (salt of unearthly oceans, burning fragment) reflects dimensional awareness bias. Details evolve causally with mutiny.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (after-goodbye discovery) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via fragment glimpses of displaced souls narrowing to temporary hours-window; agency in beach step forecloses retreat with felt hope/fear cost. Escalation driven by her perception/choice under lens, charging final embrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of goodbyes as transitions emerges implicitly from soul-displacement glimpses and final realization—"some eternities were meant to end"—reweighting premise without moralizing; 9+ test met in resonant non-literal ending image. Complexity in immortality's curse as isolation lingers via ambiguity of discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of dimensional filtering (e.g., "spaces negotiating like conspirators"); rhythmic control modulates from tedium to urgency without filter stacks. Voice texture ancient/poetic, diction plausible for 17k-year immortal. 9+ test met, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fragment began to burn" advances plot/emotion); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, propulsion syncs to pressure peaks like aurora-intensified path. Zero scaffold in closure beat; 9+ test met fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dimensional mutiny as soul-afterlife bridge transforms immortal boredom trope; risk in non-causal accumulative drive heightens conceptual stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established fragment/mutiny logic, no derivative hedging.</comment>
