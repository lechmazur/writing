<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in seasonal muteness and bell language feels particular and drives setup; actions reveal traits under process pressure. Minor weakness: internal conflict declarative rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as melting ice builds density to cadence shift; Charged Poise closure in final fading note and Mara's rest reconfigures impermanence with felt cost of dissolution legible in "thumb-sized piece remained."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bluff's mist, wind, and sculpture constrain bell responses and charge final silent image; sensory details (breath clouds, ice rainbows) selectively mirror dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wonder tightens via quickening rhythm and audience response under accumulative lens; cost of impermanence unmistakable in diminishing ice, though low antagonism limits peak agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of non-verbal truth emerges from melting process and audience transformation; final image resonates as non-literal answer, reweighting silence with wonder's color preserved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in bell-as-language noticing; rhythmic modulation fits muted intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful "glisten" motif avoids loops, though minor repetition in "sang" phrasing nudges below peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Quieting world, ice-tuned bells, and wonder preservation feels inevitable; risk in lyric process heightens stakes organically.</comment>
