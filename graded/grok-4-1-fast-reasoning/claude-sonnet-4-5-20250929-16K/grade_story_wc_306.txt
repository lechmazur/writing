<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Keegan's arc from "sincerely insincere" to raw vulnerability earned through embodied reactions like jaw tightening and head-in-hands; Mara's particular traits shine in tool use and wind-listening, but minor therapy-speak in "internal conflict shows contradictory impulses" edges it below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with chimes and mirror building to Charged Poise closure at Keegan's sinking bench moment and Mara's exit; orientation anchored by ~50 words; cost legible in "That's terrifying" line with undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chimes as recurring object constrain choices via wind interpretations and charge final lullaby scale; dawn light floods gallery to reweight certainties; sensory details (salt air, waves) selectively mirror internal states without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. doubt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chimes sequence and mirror revelation narrowing Keegan's options; agency in his lean-forward hesitation forces trade-off, cost felt in whisper and terror admission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of doubt-as-garment emerges organically from mirror/shard image shifting to "wear it" advice; final ashes scattering reconfigures premise without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer to certainty pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV (Mara-dominant) with perceptual bias in chime-reading; dialogue subtextual ("You paid") pursues goals, distinct voices (Keegan's veneer cracks); rhythmic modulation peaks in chime descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chimes advance atmosphere/plot/character); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds; precise verbs anchor propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh "conscience for hire" premise transformed via mirror/chimes synthesis; risk in wind-oracle method heightens stakes organically; final campfire-ashes callback feels inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
