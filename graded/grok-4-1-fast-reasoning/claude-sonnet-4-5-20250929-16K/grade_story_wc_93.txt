<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visions of failure ("empty bluff... rocks scattered... too late") create contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, compelling persistence; final shift of curse to gift earned by pattern completion with sister's irrecoverable loss as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via rock sequences and eel patterns to CR closure ("friction didn't disappear randomly; it was preparation"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost in transformed promise; single scene coherent, oriented early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frictionless world constrains undulating movement and rock grip to bluff's edge ("where the stone held memory of friction"), charging realization as eels shift formation below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode patterns for sister) tightens via disruptive visions narrowing futures, agency in final rock placement forcing convergence under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "too late" tears and borrowed time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora's evolution from "borrowed" to "earned" and rocks warming with purpose offer resonant CR to thematic question of endurance in unraveling world, emerging from particulars without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature patterns eels/constellations ("sacred geometries predating human mathematics"), rhythmic control compresses visions for pressure; stable single POV fits lyric Accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density in placement sequence ("primes spiraling... Fibonacci arc") varies syntax to propel; zero loops, purposeful figuratives (dust "flared, connecting rock to rock") clear in peak flare beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frictionless preparation via eel math and star dust transforms apocalypse tropes into blueprint for swimming humanity; CR realization feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
