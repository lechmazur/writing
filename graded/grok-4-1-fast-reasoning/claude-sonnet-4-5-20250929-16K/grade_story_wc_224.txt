<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied emotions peak in "hollow ache" and "thunder" that drive substitution ritual to earned reconfiguration via tactile breakthrough, revealing buried talents without unearned epiphany; minor diagnostic summary in memory flood slightly undercuts contradiction in final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of rituals and textures builds to CR closure in seeding action reweighting home as portable seed; feather inciting incident anchors causality without orientation debt, cost legible in quieted thunder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore's chambers and greenhouse constrain navigation and enable seeding, with textures (stone grooves, feather barbs) charging final image; sensory hierarchy via tactile POV bias avoids white-room, mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming home tightens via feather-texture reversal narrowing amnesia options; agency in tracing symbols forces endurance of grief cost, felt in thunder quieting, though single deepening suffices without micro-turn overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of portable belonging emerges via tactile particulars shifting from substitution pain to seeding resonance, final image non-literally repricing exile as seed without moralizing; counter-reading in scattering ambiguity lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with tactile perceptual signature modulating from ache to warmth; rhythmic compression in breakthrough beat purposeful, no head-hopping, though minor expository telling in memory recovery edges diction from peak compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (feather drift to stone blaze) with varied rhythm accelerating to closure; no loops or artifacts, metaphors texture-consistent without muddle, though selective overwriting in "flooding back" prelude risks minor propulsion dip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tactile language transforming exile trope into seed metaphor feels inevitable via prior textures; bold risk in mercury-glass seer and mountain bookstore synthesis heightens stakes organically without gimmickry or template echoes.</comment>
