<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sarah's characterization excels with concrete interiority (hands trembling on documents, then steady) and embodied grief rooted in husband's letters, driving her shift from personal solace to communal remembrance; contradictory impulses surface in her broken heart yielding to action without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered discoveries (button, notes, list), culminating in Charged Poise closure where she pins the button and begins documenting; cost legible in "Her heart remained broken, but her hands were steady," reconfiguring grief with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>File room's micro-setting (dust patterns, tarnished button, lamplight) constrains her methodical choices and charges final image with dust motes as "benedictions"; sensory hierarchy (touch, sight) filters through her archivist bias, era details plausible and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief-processing deepens via soldier's list discovery, narrowing options to active remembrance; agency in pinning button and writing forecloses passive endurance with felt emotional cost, coherent under Accumulative lens though internal more than external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of magnifying small kindnesses emerges organically from soldier's erased sacrifice and Sarah's mirroring act, resonating in final image of button and gathering pages without moralizing; reweights premise via particulars, inviting ambiguity in hope's tactful limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (files as "text," dust histories); rhythmic prose modulates elegantly from quiet examination to charged resolve, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied syntax propels from dust-reading to closure image, purposeful figures (dust "like benedictions") enhance without muddle, read-aloud rhythm flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war archival grief and soldier's hidden mercies transforms familiar loss tropes through dust-pattern ingenuity and button's quiet evolution; risk in lyric Accumulative closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
