<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (report fraud vs. save animals) act simultaneously through embodied observation of Prism and micro-choices like drafting reports, earning the final renunciation of Adrian's program with visible costs (prestige, funding). Interiority concrete via palm on glass and tail-watching. Flaw of past compliance complicates present strength without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from confession distress to Prism's shedding inspiring drafts, landing Charged Poise closure ("tail tip curled around her finger like a promise") with legible cost in shed layers (papers, security). Orientation anchored early (workshop, three days post-confession). One tightening via skin-shedding revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring terrarium and Prism constrain choices (handling inspires reconstruction) and charge final image (tail on finger against sleeve). Sensory hierarchy (mist drip, rustle) reflects POV priorities; mist lifting mirrors internal shift. Workshop feels lived-in via humidity tanks guiding action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-respect vs. compassion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via observations narrowing to reconstruction agency; deepening at shedding revelation forecloses compliance path with felt costs (resignation, independent bid). Cost unmistakable in "shedding... prestige... funding... confrontation."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of shedding fragile convictions for integrated strength emerges organically from Prism's skin-shed and Mara's writing/drafts; final image offers resonant non-literal answer (tail promise balancing respect/compassion). Minor echo in closing lines ("doing right by these creatures meant doing right by herself") borders articulation but ties to particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (animal-focused noticing: "tail tip—delicate as a question mark"); rhythmic control modulates from quiet observation to charged dawn ("stars fading... mist lifting"). No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits handler's gentle idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance image/character, e.g., "Prism's tail tip brushed... leaving... shed skin" links setting to revelation). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful figuratives ("lantern under scattered stars") cohere without muddle in peak drafting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chameleon shedding transforms fraud-recovery trope into textured growth arc, organic to handler's world; Prism/tail inflections inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk (shimmering imagery) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
