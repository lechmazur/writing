<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the scar-tracing stroke, earning the final transformation with embodied shame-shedding cost; grandmother's superstition interleaves without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as reflective density builds to rune emergence (Charged Poise closure) with legible emotional cost in "each stroke shed another layer of shame"; orientation anchors immediately in floating rock setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scars and breath crystals as micro-setting constrain the rune choice and charge the final "captured stars" image; sensory hierarchy (frost-sparkles, quill weight) filters through Kael's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-rune from pain) tightens via exhale-frost realization narrowing shame-acceptance options; quill-to-parchment press forces agency trade-off under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pain-as-preservation emerges organically from scar-spiral and ice-water shift, reweighting premise in master's "earned" verdict without moralizing; final updraft image resonates as non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in crystalline details ("frost-sparkles dance"); voice rhythm modulates from suspended tension to centered poise, eliding nothing unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in peak ("quill to parchment and began to write"); purposeful metaphors (mist rising, coal-glow) support textural lens without muddle or loops in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rune-from-scars synthesis transforms scholar-trial trope via breath-crystal quirk, risking lyric fantasy for inevitable "stories written in frost and ink"; bold platform isolation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
