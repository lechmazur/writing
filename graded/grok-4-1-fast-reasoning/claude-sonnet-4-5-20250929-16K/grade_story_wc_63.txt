<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's precision as prayer and inherited burden drive concrete micro-choices in the ritual, with embodied grief in the glowing transfer; contradictory release/survival impulses act on-page without tidy epiphany. Final walk home earns renunciation of personal grief with felt communal cost. Backstory anchors tilt present ritual without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers from climb to transfer, culminating in Charged Poise CR where names integrate into brass with ongoing cost ("tomorrow another fragment"). Orientation anchors in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity. Closure cost legible in "empty rake handle light in her hands."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and tide pools constrain ritual timing and access, charging final image of ridge "fully revealed"; pendulum bob as micro-setting enables pause transfer. Sensory bias (salt-dark wood, bioluminescent glow) filters through Mara's precision. Details evolve causally with dusk and tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance) signaled early, texturally escalates via inscription glow and name-swirl deepening knowledge/options; ritual agency forecloses isolation with communal cost. Pressure coheres to closure without reversal need. Cost unmistakable in "burden" transformed yet perpetual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges implicitly from ritual particulars, reweighting grief/memory in final pendulum glow and chimes without moralizing. Resonance from tide/clock mirroring paralysis-to-motion; ambiguity lingers in "space between remembering and forgetting."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in "precision was a form of prayer"; rhythm modulates from deliberate climb to glowing pause. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits Mara's ethicized exactitude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tiny inscriptions... desperate, uneven letters" advances backstory/action); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors purposeful (silver fish swirl), no overwriting in peak transfer.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pendulum inscription ritual synthesizes loss/precision ingeniously, transforming permanence tropes via tidal/volcanic specificity; pause physics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
