<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's scheming pacifism shown through precise, non-confrontational dance ("interrupted gently"), compelling Marcus's shift; his resentment calcifies into identity, earned via contradictory body impulses overriding mind until weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from box handoff to visions to bodily shake, yielding RR closure in weeping with emotional cost ("painfully, accepted it"); orientation anchored by Marcus's arrival (~100 words).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sanctuary walls constrain by manifesting memories, charging final image of wavering past selves; soundless amplification and shifting reality filter through Elena's priorities, mirroring internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resentment release) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via cellular memory and visions narrowing denial options; cost legible in shoulders shaking, foreclosing grudge path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resentment-as-teacher theme emerges organically from cylinder intact despite break, reweighting prior sibling vision without statement; final grace acceptance answers via non-literal image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited on Elena's perceptual scheming bias ("carefully calibrated"); dialogue subtext-driven (Marcus resists, Elena persuades indirectly), distinct voices under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety (short emotional beats amid fluid descriptions); no loops, purposeful metaphors like "architecture of his sense of self" propel without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory therapy in shifting-reality sanctuary transforms resentment trope; risk in pacifist manipulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
