<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied steadiness in hands and curious approach to pigeon revealing meticulous traits under pressure. Contradictory impulses—direct refusal vs. lateral progress—act simultaneously, earning the final endurance of parallel documentation with felt cost to simplicity. Final choice hierarchy of values (completeness over partisanship) crystallized on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via observations building to Charged Poise closure: "She would make copies... ensure it couldn't be presented partially," reconfiguring her recording method with conceptual cost to straight-line demands. Single continuous scene adheres to defaults; orientation anchored in first paragraph (who/where/when); lens holds without ambiguity, with persistent constraint of scrutiny shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting (fountain, ivy, dusk) constrains choices as sanctuary under watch and charges final image of "gathering darkness... wind shift." Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered through weather expertise (pigeon exhaustion, air moisture); details evolve causally from hush to deepening evening, mirroring internal depths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. data weaponization) signaled early via shadow, tightens accumulatively through message revelation changing knowledge/options, culminating in agency-driven renunciation of direct confrontation. Cost legible in foreclosed partisan path: "She couldn't simply refuse"; pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of completeness vs. simplification emerges organically from particulars (official data vs. parallel journals/photos), with final image "recording the depths" offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting records' truth. Subtext in layered courtyard mirrors resistance to surface readings; no moralizing, ambiguity in "choosing completeness" lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: weather-attuned noticing ("wind shift... smelled of growing things"). Prose texture distinct in syntax/rhythm modulating from calm observation to deepened resolve; no head-hopping, diction POV-plausible without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "set her leather satchel... feeling the weight of being watched"); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor scaffold in repeated "recording" stems purposeful for motif, not loop; no filter stacks or figurative muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quarantine zone politics with meteorological integrity and lateral tactics transforms tropes; "parallel documentation project" turn inevitable from prior particulars. Risk-taking in quiet, textural closure heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
