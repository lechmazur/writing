<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in the woman's anguish (family mourning vs. truth) act simultaneously through clutching/shaking hands and dialogue; Marina's incisive kindness compels her earned shift to nuance with relational cost at closure. Final choice to tell complicated truth forecloses simplistic narrative, visibly costing certainty. Voice distinction shines in telepathic poise vs. bubbling protest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations densify from secret's reveal to ampoule's memories, culminating in CR where statues turn, reweighting history with conceptual cost of chosen sacrifice. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (drowned garden, Marina, descendant). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of stone-eternity shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drowned garden (kelp-rose trellises, coral-cracked marble) constrains via water/breathing gear and charges closure with animate statues pulsing. Sensory hierarchy (bioluminescent catches, bubbling voice) filters through Marina's stone perception. Final image of stone hearts in geological time mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. nuance) signaled early, escalates via deepening revelations that force woman's stance crystallization under accumulative lens. Ampoule opening tests commitment, foreclosing innocence narrative with felt cost of ancestral complicity. One tightening suffices; agency in opening/decision charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nuance over certainty emerges organically from cascading revelations and final CR image of new guardian amid animate lifelessness, reweighting sacrifice without moralizing. Incisive kindness subtext tensions truth's wound/heal. Resonant non-literal answer: love requires destroying to save.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited via Marina's telepathy yields distinct perceptual signature (stone lips unmoving, thoughts kind/incisive); dialogue natural/subtextual advances plot (bubbling anguish pursues denial, telepathy persuades). Rhythmic control modulates revelation density; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "liquid light spilled out—not poison, but preserved memories"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (flowers opening in time-lapse for revelations), no overwriting in peak. Closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: plague-volunteers as telepathic stone guardians curating drowned knowledge transforms tropes organically. Risky underwater garden with animate lifelessness heightens stakes; non-obvious CR (nuance welcomes via complicity) inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
