<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's decisively kind trait enables persistent phone calls culminating in Linda's arrival, earning the reconciliation with visible relational cost; Richard's motivation rooted in regret compels micro-choices like sharing memories. Limited interior contradiction for Maya keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via Maya's recordings/calls leading to reunion (because/therefore); closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page in Richard/Linda hand-hold and talk until sunset, with death cost three weeks later felt via vinyl reprise. Orientation anchored early in hospice/room 14.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clouds as recurring object constrain closure image ("clouds continued their ancient drift" contrasts mended love); thin air, lavender/ozone scent selective via POV urgency. Micro-setting (piano, vinyl) charges pivotal reunion beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye/reunify) signaled early, tightens causally via 18th call success narrowing options; agency in Maya's persistence forecloses permanent silence with death as on-page cost. One meaningful reversal sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vinyl shifts from fracture to mended symbol in final image, reweighting mundane-to-sacred theme without moralizing; emerges organically from recordings/hymning, resonant non-literal answer to breakage/reunification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Maya with perceptual signature ("hymning the mundane"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I'm sorry"/"I'm here"); rhythmic control in poetic phrases like "pulsing stillness" modulates pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/prose propulsion ("cotton-sea of clouds"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor overwriting in metaphors ("prayer made flesh") but purposeful without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy reunifying via vinyl/hymning mundane transforms deathbed trope; risk in poetic tone heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
