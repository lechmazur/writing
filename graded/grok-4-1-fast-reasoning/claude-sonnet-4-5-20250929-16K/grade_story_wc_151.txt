<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to preserve margins drives consistent micro-choices like decoding chalk and creating pseudonyms, with embodied nostalgia in handling the clipboard. Interiority particular via grandmother's photos and resistance impulse; endurance earned without tidy epiphany. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses caps below 9.0; final graphite press reveals values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chalk decode to pattern recognition to handoff, culminating in Charged Poise CR of smeared chalk and new codes, reweighting ephemerality with conceptual cost of "marks that would last just long enough." Orientation anchored in first paragraph (arcade, dawn, clipboard). Single scene, no lens ambiguity, persistent constraint of time/courier shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Golden arcade at dawn constrains choices via dawn isolation and impending vendors/courier, charging final image of sun through glass and smeared chalk mirroring destruction/meaning. Sensory hierarchy (visual amber rays, tactile chalk) reflects Maya's priorities; ebony clipboard as micro-setting enables resistance. Details integrated via goal-action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of analog resistance signaled early, tightens accumulatively via juxtaposed requests suggesting "digital suicide pact," narrowing to urgent Sector Nine delivery. Agency in smearing/decoding alters tactics with felt cost of erasure; courier exchange crystallizes stance. Minor abstractness in cluster pattern slightly mutes visceral price before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia emerges organically from chalk codes, clipboard properties, and final image repricing network margins as flourishing mystery. Subtext in Chen's "shared conspiracy" and smeared swirls invites ambiguity without morals; protagonist arc inextricable from theme of deliberate humanity. Resonant non-literal answer in graphite marks lasting "just long enough."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in biased noticing of "carefully inventive" codes and postal history; diction/rhythm modulate from reflective to pressured at courier arrival. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden, distinct voices (Maya precise, Chen weighted). No head-hopping, elision taught via codes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring dawn progression; zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Rhythm accelerates in courier beat, breathes in reflections; final line "pressed her graphite harder" recharges motifs crisply. Read-aloud ear perfect, no overwriting in peak (smearing chalk).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pseudonym creators via child chalk codes transforms dystopian tropes through grounded postal nostalgia and "digital suicide pact"; fresh synthesis of arcade as resistance hub feels inevitable. Risk in lyric Accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes, conceptual integrity full-commit.</comment>
