<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's interiority shines in embodied fear—"blurred at the edges like an overexposed negative"—with contradictory impulses peaking when she leans into the mirror despite terror. Final renunciation of fear feels earned through micro-choices like clutching the clasp and reading the entry. Advisor adds crucible pressure without overwhelming her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from curse description to book entry to unbosoming, yielding CR closure in "something beautiful and terrible smiled back" with conceptual cost of permanence lost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. No causality breaks; pattern pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors constrain choice by multiplying distortions, charging final image where reflections become "sanctuary." Green luminance from clasp integrates tactilely with glass, mirroring internal shift. Sensory selection (whispers, pulsing light) purposeful and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curse as imprisonment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via advisor's whispers and dictionary to unbosoming that crystallizes stance. Agency in confession forecloses hiding path with visible cost in dissolving image. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dissolution-as-freedom emerges organically from particulars like paradoxical notes and shifting reflections, answered non-literally in final smile "not quite her, not quite anyone." No moralizing; resonance from image shift reweights curse premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: curse filters all noticing (e.g., "indistinct as her own face"). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven—"Fear is the map"—distinguishing advisor's silk-glass voice. Rhythmic control modulates from whispery tension to luminous release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like clasp description advancing prop, atmosphere, stakes. Rhythm varies (short confessions vs. flowing realizations); metaphors coherent ("smoke, like possibility"). Minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms photo-curse trope via grandmother's choice and funhouse mirrors into fresh CR on impermanence. Paradoxical dictionary infuses bold ingenuity; final shadow-becoming-everything feels inevitable yet risky. No derivative echoes; synthesis organic.</comment>
