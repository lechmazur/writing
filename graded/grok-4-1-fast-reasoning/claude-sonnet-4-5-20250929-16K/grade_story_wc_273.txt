<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in brother's death compels final hunt decision with embodied serene anger; interiority concrete via "still lake" but edges toward poetic abstraction over raw contradiction in crisis recall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ink whorls to drone footage realization, landing Charged Poise closure in "She would disappear too, eventually" with conceptual cost of reframed past; orientation anchored early, one tightening via patterns linking to crisis time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sandstone alcove and wind constrain tracking via drone crevice navigation and mirror relentless resolve in final desert turn; selective sensory focus on prismatic flashes and fading ink charges closure image without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crisis-time understanding tightens via ink patterns deepening to personal loss, forcing hunt renunciation of normal life; cost felt in feral endurance, coherent under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fractured time emerges organically from ink mandalas and brother's "stretched seconds," reweighted in final compass image without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in exploitable "spaces between heartbeats" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with feral perceptual bias in "patterns of wind and stone"; rhythmic prose modulates from calm observation to intensified fury, distinct texture in syntax without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, realization without loops; varied rhythm propels to closure, minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "breath from a mirror" risks muddle but stays voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse-crisis as ink-pattern portals transforms time-dilation trope into hunt-worthy premise; risk in conceptual boldness pays off in inevitable hindsight reconfiguration of loss.</comment>
