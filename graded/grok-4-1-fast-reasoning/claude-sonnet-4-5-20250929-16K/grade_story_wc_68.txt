<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcellus's rationally rebellious traits shine in embodied micro-choices like holding the cog and mutter under patrol shadow, earning the final sealing endurance with clear cost of irrelevance; minor diagnostic phrasing like "rationally rebellious" slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via evidence density building to Conceptual Repricing closure in "sealed his notes... Future excavators... decide," reweighting preservation with undeniable conceptual cost of current irrelevance; orientation anchored early in storm drain cell, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken ruins constrain choices (hiding from patrol, excavation access) and charge final image ("sedimentary layers time added next"); selective sensory details like "fish nested in judge's chambers" filter through POV priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation vs. irrelevance deepens accumulatively through evidence layers and patrol tightening, forcing endurance agency; cost legible in "irrelevance was a philosopher's death," charging final poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically from particulars like hospital records vs. Council mysticism, culminating in resonant CR final image of patient cogs that reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in technical observations ("brass teeth catch the dim light"); rhythmic modulation under pressure supports accumulative texture, no dialogue or slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in reflective evidence summaries (e.g., primitive ignorance repeated) slightly dull mid-beats but spare closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh epistemological angle on post-apoc via chronometer as truth-tool transforms tropes; final CR turn feels inevitable from sedimentary particulars without hedging.</comment>
