<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (curiosity amid grief) act vividly as Maren fits goggles and turns pages under floor-by-floor pressure; final detachment earned by diary's revelations with emotional cost of reweighting sorrow. Interiority particular and embodied, e.g., "throat tightened."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: elevator floors pace entry density from joy to anguish, culminating in CR closure—"She held proof"—with undeniable conceptual cost of permanence over grief. Orientation anchored immediately; structure ingenious without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice walls' refracted light constrains reading via goggles, charging final image; sensory details (groaning elevator, frost-etched window) selectively POV-filtered by servant's tactile priorities. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding captain's true self) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via darkening entries that deepen knowledge and narrow emotional options; cost legible in "affectionately detached from her own grief," crystallizing stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted joy emerges organically from particulars (diary illustrations, light ribbons); final image—"clouds drifted past like patient ghosts... personalities after all"—resonates non-literally, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (light/scattered motifs biased by sky-sailor curiosity); rhythmic control modulates elegantly from ascent tension to descent poise, e.g., "ribbons of gold and crimson."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; rhythm propels via floor beats and varied syntax, metaphors coherent (e.g., "scattered light" unifies); closure image sharpened without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: elevator floors + light-encrypted diary transforms servant-captain trope into fresh emotional cryptography; risk-taking in floor-pacing structure heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
