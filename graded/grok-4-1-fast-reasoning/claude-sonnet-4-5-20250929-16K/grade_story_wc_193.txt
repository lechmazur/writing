<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's pyramid backstory anchors motivations, with mischievous spark explicitly igniting her volunteer choice under paradox pressure; contradictory ignore/engage impulses act in scene, earning the fusion endurance with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as glitchy texts and bolt appearances densify to threshold confrontation; closure CR lands on-page via bolt fusing to chest, reweighting pressure with "immense" felt cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms and fault-line threshold constrain choices (glimpses pressure decision); final blaze recharges them as quantum-possibility setting, mirroring internal diamond transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant paradox-anchoring stake signaled via texts tightens through presence dialogue, forcing volunteer agency with "immense" pressure cost legible in fusion moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pressure-to-diamonds theme emerges organically via bolt, texts, and volunteer; final "portal" image offers non-literal resonant reweighting of regrets without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (weathered hands, mischievous lens on rules); presence dialogue carries layered subtext, advancing to volunteer without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory/action lines; no loops/artifacts, rhythmic variety peaks in "pressure began immediately" fusion beat with clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quantum-physical world with mushroom anchor and bolt fusion synthesizes fresh portal-scheme inversion; risk-taking in parallel glimpses heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
