<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's confidently uncertain trait drives micro-choices like touching nib to screen, earning shift to multiplicity with cost of prior failure's guilt; contradictory impulses act in revision beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density from pen-signal interaction builds to seven Meridians and response; CR closure reweights singular truth via final pen image with conceptual cost of unbending certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Anomaly and pen as micro-setting constrain revisions ("nib to screen"), charging closure with "bent starlight" on nib; sensory selectivity (head ache soothing) mirrors internal unbending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (accurate signals) deepens via pen-enabled contingencies, narrowing to trade-off of certainty; cost felt in "polite gratitude worse than rage," charging settlers' adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of contingent truths emerges via Meridian variants; final image non-literally answers singular certainty with multiplicity resonance, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("characters rearranging like startled birds"); rhythmic texture modulates from distortion soothing to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in revision beats ("traced contingent paths") propels accumulatively; no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "unbend reality's rigid spine" clarify without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exotic nib resonating with anomaly synthesizes quantum editing premise inevitably; transforms failure trope via probability paths, risking bold conceptual risk without gimmick.</comment>
