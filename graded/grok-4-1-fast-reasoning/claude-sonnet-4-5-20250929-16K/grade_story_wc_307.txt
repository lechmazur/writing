<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maia's shift from seeking invisibility to embracing presence/absence duality earned through trance participation and her stone drop; Keiran's embodied youth and deliberate teaching reveal character-specific flaws and motives without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via repeated stone drops to Conceptual Repricing closure; Maia's stone drop and felt peace ("sycamore hush deepen into something like peace") deliver on-page cost of acceptance, reweighting her premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto's pulsing shimmer and pond ripples constrain revelation and charge final image; selective sensory details (violet bleeding to copper) mirror internal expansion without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disappear vs. paradox) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through trance and personal stone drop narrowing options; agency in Maia's participation forecloses hiding with legible peace-as-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of presence/absence emerges organically from ripples and Keiran's unbecoming; final image of shared silence reconfigures prior withholding without moralizing, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Maia's biased perceptual signature (patterns in gaps); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing Keiran's deliberate whisper from trance-softened narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety and no loops; figurative language purposeful ("erosion in reverse") without muddle, propelling to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backwards aging and ripple paradoxes transforms trope into inevitable CR; risk in lyric meditation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
