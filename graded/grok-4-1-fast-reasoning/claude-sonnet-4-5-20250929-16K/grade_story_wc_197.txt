<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's resourcefulness compels decoding the puddle-map and upload despite raids; embodied tension in "warm key" and descent aligns motives, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses in peak escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain from compromised network to puddle decoding unlocks room and DC upload with boots-overhead cost; lens holds cleanly, orientation anchored early at lagoon edge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Puddles' "ghost geography" constrains discovery choice and charges final lagoon escape image, with bioluminescent glow filtering Mira's urgent perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Raids signal stake early, tightening via boots forces upload agency and escape trade-off; cost legible in "hours, maybe less" but one micro-turn suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Indifference as "collective shrug" emerges via grandmother stories and transmissions, resonating in star-doubling image without moralizing; reweights erasure premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature narrows to salt-concrete darkness under stress; rhythmic diction modulates tension without drift or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in "three puddle-streams converged" propels without loops; figurative "doubling the light" purposeful, no artifacts touch upload climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Puddle-map as etched resistance transforms dystopian trope organically; key-in-depression turn feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
