<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margritte's cryptic riddle responses and vial uncorking reveal motive hierarchy under pressure; Tessian's accusation-to-wonder shift earned via frost evidence and buckling certainties, with contradictory impulses in simultaneous persistence and explanation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as paradox ripples from broadsheet to frost reveal to whisper release, yielding CR closure in "the library finally learned to breathe"; cost legible in fractured certainties and drifting permanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost patterns on glass trees constrain Margritte's dawn documentation and charge final image of melting messages; cloud-sea churn beneath transparent floors grounds tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whisper uncorking deepens stake by forcing system buckle, narrowing perfection's options with legible cost to rigid harmony; accumulative density reweights via shivering trees and flying books.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frost as "love letter from chaos to order" reconfigures perfection=death premise non-literally; emergent from print-frost-whisper progression without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature favors instability motifs like "non-repeating sequences"; dialogue subtext distinguishes Margritte's riddles from Tessian's directness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Rustling awakening that moved through the glass orchard like wind through autumn leaves" delivers high density and propulsion; varied rhythm, zero loops in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reverse-printing contradictions in negotiable reality transforms archival trope via bottled whisper synthesis; surreal logic risks paid in breathing library image.</comment>
