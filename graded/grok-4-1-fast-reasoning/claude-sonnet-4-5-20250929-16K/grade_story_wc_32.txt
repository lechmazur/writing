<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the whisper to master before plunging the crozier, earning the final choice to walk unmapped paths; stoically sensitive trait balances persistence with calcified hope, shown through embodied micro-choices under failure's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as failures accumulate to "the penny finally dropped" realization (DC via staff animation) and Charged Poise closure (living staff interrupts destiny), with nexus pulse as felt cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains kneeling/plunging choice and charges final pulse image; twilight filters perception selectively through alchemist's eyes, sensory hierarchy vivid in "liquid heat" and wooden veins as "luminous blood."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (vivification vs. prophecy) tightens via "penny drops" epiphany narrowing rigid formulas to improvisation; agency in plunging/singing drives escalation under Accumulative lens, cost felt in "dangerous luxury of hope."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges implicitly from failures-as-approximations and crozier's "deliberate scar"; final "frozen bloom" image resonantly reweights premise without moral, tying arc to "break what is."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in alchemical noticing ("veins carrying luminous blood"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in singing sequence, diction modulates from reflective to charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in transformation sequence ("gold leaf burned away first... rewoven"), rhythm varies for ear without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical failures into living "frozen bloom" staff from broken crozier; risk in poetic voice and interrupted-prophecy turn feels inevitable, transforming trope through specifics.</comment>
