<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict peaks in "She resisted instinctively, every cell crying out to remain unchanged," with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, earning her final letting-go with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scent density building to transformation; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "She let go," reconfiguring her form with felt reluctance cost, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's bending branches and glittering pollen constrain her ritual and charge the final image between "two silver apple trees"; sensory filter via beast whisperer's priorities vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively through scent layers forcing her resistance-then-release; agency in unstoppering vials forecloses human stasis with legible cost in blurring edges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant endurance emerges organically via fortune prophecy to final bridge image; resonant non-literal answer in "transformed but enduring, changed but still herself" reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in scent-weaving holds stable single POV; brief dialogue at closure distinct in idiom ("language of letting go while holding on").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (scents forming smiles); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops, though minor spice-list density risks overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie prophecy with scent-conjuring transforms death/rebirth tropes; risk in cosmic ritual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via beasts' guidance.</comment>
