<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's brazen calm surprises even herself early, rooting systematic actions in terminal motivation; contradictory impulses (fear stripped yet profound absurdity) act in planting scene, earning final endurance with exceeded prognosis as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knowledge density builds from mapping to copper wiring success, tightening to CR closure in diary's final entry ("roots and stone and breath all twisted together") with conceptual cost of death reframed as connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid selectivity (mineral pores' mist shifting pale green) filters through Marina's botanical priorities, constraining choices like drilling pillars; living pillars charge final image of humming vitality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore failing temple) signaled early, deepens via symbiosis discovery narrowing options to interspecies method; agency in remodeling forecloses mainland path with felt cost of time, charged in exceeded prognosis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges via particulars (copper signals, mist change), resonating in final image without overt moral; diary's "listening" line borders echo but integrates as earned realization from struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (geological acupuncture); rhythmic control heightens pressure in planting beat, diction biased toward symbiosis without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short punchy revelations amid flowing observations); no loops/artifacts, concrete images like "hairline fractures spreading" replace generics, ear-test clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of terminal care with grown architecture (pillars as "ancient teeth," copper whispers); risk in interspecies philosophy transforms dying trope, inevitable in hindsight via diary legacy.</comment>
