<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to learn repair rhythm intensifies credibly through discoveries, culminating in earned change as she gathers gears "with new reverence." Interiority concrete in gear tracings and prophecy readings, but epiphanies like "suddenly she understood" feel mildly unearned without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from prophecy scraps to mirror patterns to audible rhythm, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in final gear-heartbeat sync with felt cost of prior "hollow[ness]." Orientation anchored early in stair-climb; single scene tightens meaningfully at vial pour without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen library and mirrors constrain choices (tracing spines, following brightness) and charge final image via refracting light enabling gear materialization. Sensory details (gleaming frost, metal "singing" on ice) selective through locksmith bias, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn repair) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via prophecy-to-mirrors-to-vial deepening that narrows from seeking to understanding with visible cost in realized past tool-like existence. Agency peaks in vial uncapping; pressure coheres without reversal need under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness in broken things emerges organically from gear/vial/mirror particulars, resonating in final prophecy scrap without statement. Subtext in "silence between movements" reweights premise non-literally; ambiguity in "time breaks to be mended" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with locksmith perceptual signature (mechanisms as "singing," "rhythm"); rhythmic prose modulates beautifully under revelation pressure. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in mirror chamber ("patterns emerged—geometric, rhythmic"), but minor overwriting in stacked figures like "visual symphony" and "heartbeat of repair" slightly muddles peak clarity without loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith-to-clockmaker arc via eclipse-timed fantasy mechanics feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens epiphany stakes organically, transforming prophecy tropes through lived gear inheritance.</comment>
