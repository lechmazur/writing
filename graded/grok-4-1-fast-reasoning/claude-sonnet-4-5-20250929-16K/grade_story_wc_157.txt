<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Malachi's rogue charm and raw defiance ("stand guard over our own sparks") compel higher-stakes commitment from the group; older man's anecdote adds secondary pressure with embodied cost; minor one-note supporting voices limit peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as proposal objections deepen to city-wide evolution; CR closure via fuller rattle reconfigures surveillance premise with felt wild-growth cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse's off-grid fogged glass and insect adaptation constrain safe plotting and charge ending reprise; sensory details (soil, beetle wings, hum) filter through Malachi's priorities without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mental resistance signaled early tightens via Chen/Iris objections and auditor patrols; gardens' success forecloses submission path with ongoing seizure risk legible in final contrast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of untaxable wild thought emerges via taxed eggs/daughter's drawing to vine dissent; final "they can't tax what grows wild" non-literally reweights premise through image, not statement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in chaos-to-silence arc; varied syntax propels proposal beat without loops or scaffold; minor elevated diction fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Botanical code vs. neural tax synthesizes fresh dystopia angle, transformed via gourd mechanics and garden tactics; risk of analog resistance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
