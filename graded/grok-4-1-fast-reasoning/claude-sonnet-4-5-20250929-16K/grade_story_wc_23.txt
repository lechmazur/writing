<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots deeply in daughter's loss, shown through concrete micro-choices like tracing maps and instructing caller. Interiority particularized via embodied actions with censer foot. Earned stasis in endurance forecloses quick fixes with felt personal cost; minor reflection tilt keeps it under BRR.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: phone call accumulates density toward Charged Poise closure in waiting image, reweighting navigation stake with ongoing loss cost. Orientation anchored early (station, hydraulics, maps). Single scene with backstory shards fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station and censer foot as micro-settings constrain choices (anchor point) and charge final image (handled post-call). Sensory details (creaking, starlight, warm stone) selective via POV urgency. Object mirrors internal geography of loss without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guiding lost to practice for daughter) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via call success deepening hope amid moon-flux constraint. Agency in cryptic instructions forecloses tech reliance with endurance cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-navigated return emerges from particulars (censer, calls, reverse river), reweighted in final waiting image without moralizing. Subtext in object's shift from prayers to coordinates charges daughter's oblique loss. Ambiguity lingers in solace without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (patchwork stitching, groaning as comfort). Voice rhythmic, modulating from cryptic dialogue subtext to textured reflection. Dialogue natural, goal-driven (warm stone revelation advances stake).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "bronze censer foot... zero meridian" advances setting/character/theme). Rhythms vary for propulsion; minor repetition of "groaning" purposeful as motif. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-disaster memory-navigation via antique object transforms lighthouse trope organically. Risk in abstract "geography of loss" paid off through tactile guidance beats. Non-obvious reverse migration charges closure without gimmick.</comment>
