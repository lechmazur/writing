<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in empathy drives micro-choices like learning Tigrinya and direct address to Elevator Seven, earning the harmony; embodied emotion in smiling and brimming eyes avoids labels. Internal resolve sharpens under Seven's silence, showing contradiction between tenderness and decisiveness without alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: responses build density from hesitant hums to full harmony, with Seven's silence as pattern break tightening to RR closure in child's song joined by all, cost felt in Mira's risked trust and eyes brimming. Orientation anchored early in tower and silos; single scene causality clear without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower gears and meridians constrain broadcast via wound mechanism, charging final image where clock marks "human movements" reconfiguring silos into chorus. Sensory hush of starlight and prairie darkness filters through Mira's priorities, evolving with harmony; spatial choreography of headset and controls coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to connect silos escalates accumulatively via partial responses to Seven's silence, her prompting narrowing options with agency-driven deepening; cost legible in trust-risk amid suspicion, charging harmony without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resonant differences emerges from interwoven songs, final prairie chorus reweighting silos as "neighbors" without moralizing; subtext in child’s pure melody offers non-literal answer to isolation, embracing complexity via unrehearsed harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Mira's perceptual bias toward celestial/mechanical details; voice modulates lyrically yet grounded, dialogue natural/subtextual as prompts evoke shared fear. Rhythmic control heightens hush-to-chorus shift without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (e.g., "pine-cone shape fitting perfectly"); rhythm varies with scene acceleration to harmony, minor figurative density in opening but purposeful and un-muddled at peak. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grain silos as linguistic isolates rehabbed via clock-tower song transforms refugee trope organically; risk in direct Tigrinya address heightens stakes, inevitable harmony from particulars feels non-obvious.</comment>
