<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—empathic witnessing versus detached commerce—act simultaneously during the blotter application, earning her final endurance with visible self-cost; Thomas applies secondary pressure effectively. Minor slip in Thomas's generic traits slightly limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with density tightening through transformation to a Charged Poise CR in Maren's final self-application and realization ("each counterfeit... carved away a small piece"); orientation anchored immediately in grotto; cost legible in authenticity erosion image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's amber walls and bioluminescent glow constrain the ritual and charge the final worktable return; sensory hierarchy (static electricity as purple/amber) reflects Maren's professional bias, evolving causally with dusk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief subsumption) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via frequency shift and Maren's witnessing; agency in micro-choices forecloses raw authenticity paths with felt self-cost at ending, though external pressure from Thomas remains subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Half-truths emerge organically from particulars (blotter replacing pain, Maren's omissions), culminating in resonant CR ("half truths—they protected... never quite reaching the light") that reweights her premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (emotions as "jagged purple lightning" to "amber current") biases noticing consistently; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("This will feel like remembering"); rhythmic control heightens transformation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm supports ear test; minor figurative density ("purple lightning... amber current") in peak transformation beat coherent and purposeful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fragrance chemistry, electrical sensing, and emotional counterfeiting transforms grief trope organically; risk in oblique world rules pays off in inevitable CR hindsight.</comment>
