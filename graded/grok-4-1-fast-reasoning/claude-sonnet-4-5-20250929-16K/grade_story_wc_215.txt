<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's reclusive silence contradicts his growing engagement with the ghost's pattern, earning his final nod and commitment; embodied in reinforcing seals with wax and failed box attempts. Ghost applies subtle pressure through purposeful observation, revealing keeper history. Minor slip: ghost's traits border archetypal without deeper flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as observational density tightens to box-opening revelation; closure as Conceptual Repricing with preservation duty's conceptual cost legible in "Silas nodded once" and new-box pledge. Orientation anchored early in apiary; one meaningful deepening via light-panel sequence. Persistent box constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hives and stained-glass panels constrain puzzle-solving and charge closure's new-box image; sensory details like "scorched breath testing the seals" and "crystallized honey" selectively bias through Silas's beekeeper gaze. Atmosphere tensions isolation against oasis purposefulness. Micro-setting (box shadows) drives pivotal turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock box without destruction signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failed methods to light-sequence success; agency in panel rotations forecloses smashing with cost of ongoing witness duty. Ghost's pattern deepens knowledge under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence's weight emerges from list revelation, reweighting exile as covenant in final image without statement; unspoken acknowledgments resonate via particulars like notations on workers. Resists tidy moral through preserved ambiguity of ghosts' visibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of wordless attunement; voice modulates rhythmically from wary observation to "mute eloquence" crystallization. Diction like "wavering like heat shimmer" biases selectively to Silas's silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from discovery to "box bloomed open like petals"; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor figurative density in opening ("honey darker than midnight") purposeful, not overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-catastrophe ghosts, apiary covenant, and stained-glass puzzle transforms isolation trope; risk in mute-ghost communion heightens stakes via pattern-teaching. Box-list turn inevitable from established observation.</comment>
