<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to chase hush roots deeply in inherited disbelief, with embodied interiority via dust motes and forehead press; contradictory impulses to warn vs. silence earned via father's shadow; final endurance/renunciation separates him convincingly without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure ("hush... you became"), with cost legible in final separation image; orientation anchored early (lighthouse prison, cell lattice); single tightening via tide/bodies anticipation pays off without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Copper light and lattice constrain perception and charge final repose image; sensory hierarchy (visual amber columns, creaking, whispers) reflects urgency and POV bias; spatial choreography coherent via scuffs, door, window; environment mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush amid disbelief) signaled early, tightens texturally via tide drop/bodies reveal forcing stance crystallization; endurance agency forecloses warning path with felt inheritance cost; pressure coheres to charged poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth threading inherited lies emerges organically via lattice confessions and dust-hovering callbacks; final CR reweights premise non-literally ("someone might listen"); ambiguity lingers in disbelief's shadow without tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (copper tones, suspended secrets); rhythmic control modulates reflective intensity; purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early, legible at CR; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "lattice... salvaged" anchors setting/motif); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts in peak realization; figurative coherence (barnacle, blood-water) pattern-taught without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-wolf myth into lighthouse confessional via hush/silence distinction; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens stakes; no derivative echoes, particulars (scuffs, tide teeth) irreplaceable.</comment>
