<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya's motivation shines in contradictory impulses—wanting to send Sienna away yet offering the ring—earned through embodied scars and micro-choices like picking up ash. Sienna remains archetypal with minimal interiority or distinction, but Maya's arc to teaching forecloses solitude with felt relational cost. Voice distinction holds in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from solitude to shared burning; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "Together, under starlight, they began the tender work of destruction," reconfiguring emptiness with undeniable encroachment cost. Single scene causality links arrival-recognition-offer-step-burn via motivated ellipsis. Orientation anchored immediately in ash and sanctuary; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ash, starlight, and scorched ground constrain choices (Sienna's footprints, phone placement) and charge final image. Doorknocker ring recurs tactilely, mirroring internal bridges. Sensory selection (cold brass, trembling hands) filters through Maya's tender-keeping bias, evolving dynamically without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solitude vs. selective connection) signaled early, deepens via Sienna's trembling to phone placement, narrowing options under accumulative lens with Maya agency in ring offer and nod. Escalation reweights via recognition of shared suffocation; cost legible in "careful encroachment." No reversals needed; quiet tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of intentional destruction for self breathes through fire/ash images shifting from isolation to tender linkage, emergent in scars and phone burn without statement. Final image resonates non-literally on breathing via suffocation/death, embracing ambiguity of connection's price. No moralizing; counter-reading of risky entanglement lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable on Maya with perceptual signature in "tender shadow" diction and selective ash/starlight noticing. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You can't stay" vs. ring offer); rhythms distinguish (Maya's measured vs. Sienna's whisper). Compression taught early, pays off in charged ending poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short punchy dialogue beats, flowing imagery). Minor figurative density in fire motifs purposeful and consistent, no muddle or loops. Propulsion peaks in final paragraph's cadence shift without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms bridge-burning trope into literal ashen sanctuary and surgical fire-tending, grown from Maya's scars/voice. Risky lyric accumulation heightens solitude-connection stakes organically; no derivative templates, inevitable in hindsight via ring/ash reprise.</comment>
