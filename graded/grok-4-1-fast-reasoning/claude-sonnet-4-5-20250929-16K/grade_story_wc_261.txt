<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradiction (scar touch vs. plant panic) driving micro-choices like watering ivy; final acceptance of fragmentation as rooted in care earns closure shift with felt cost of perpetual tenderness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via deepening pattern reads (coffee rings to scar), yielding on-page CR where sand resumes and hands warm; orientation anchored early in tower post-surgery, cost legible in enduring scar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy and hourglass as micro-settings constrain (telepathy floods mind) and charge final image (palms to glass); selective sensory hierarchy (plant whispers, dawn hush) mirrors introspection without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore gift) deepens accumulatively through ring examination narrowing options from failure to acceptance; agency in softened vision forces trade-off, cost visible in "scar ached less" but remains tender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of open wounds emerges implicitly from scar/ring/ivy parallels, final palms-to-glass reweights "displaced" as delivered without moral; ambiguity lingers in human imperfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical close-third perceptual signature (plant broadcasts as "thirsty-dying-roots-dry") modulates rhythm with intensity; purposeful compression in realizations stays legible, no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via image-stacking (ivy presses glass); no loops or artifacts, rhythm breathes from introspective pause to dawn release in final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-reading, plant telepathy, displaced miracles transforms healing trope; risk in lyric CR (sand trembles) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
