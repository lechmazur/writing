<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong: "weathered innocence" embodies contradictory fear/wonder acting simultaneously, compelling her preparation despite reticence; final resolve to testify earned by prior discoveries. Minor slip: internal conflict more stated than dramatized in peak activation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with crystal activation layering voices toward CR closure (crystal pulses agreement); cost legible in "trembled" and Council's looming rejection. Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rose-gold light creeping across floorboards and crystal rainbows on "complete" charge final image, constraining her placement/activation choices; selective sensory hush/whispers reflect scholarly urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove growth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fractured voices/verified predations; agency in tuning fork method forecloses doubt with felt isolation cost, but abstract Council pressure mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mycelium/coral metaphors emerge organically from crystal sequences, final crystal pulse reweights stasis premise non-literally with growth's undeniable reach; no moralizing, ambiguity in "if she could convince" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with scholarly perceptual signature ("roots intertwining underground"); rhythmic modulation peaks in whispers filling library, diction controlled without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., voices overlapping centuries in one line advances knowledge/atmosphere); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (disaster/ill-starred), zero loops/artifacts even in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sonically reflective crystal synthesizing temporal language growth transforms dictionary-completion trope organically; risk in recursive mycelium frame inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
