<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in "tremor of certainty she couldn't quite grasp"; final writing choice earned by prior paraphrasing under humming pressure, with contradictory seek-reform impulse acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of humming/resonance builds to CR closure in "she had stridden through the boundary at last," with legible cost of refusing council authority crystallized in writing image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quartz pillars constrain choices (approach, touch, elicit response) and charge final humming approval; sensory hierarchy (sub-hearing hum to teeth ache) reflects aesthetic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grasp essence) tightens via deepening hum/tremor forcing realization under accumulative lens; agency in paraphrasing forecloses rigid replication with felt risk of heresy, though cost oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges via particulars like paraphrased phrases; final writing image offers resonant answer reweighting ban as "fragile as first ice" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in aesthetic noticing ("cloud-shadow across grass"); rhythmic lyricism modulates with intensity, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via sensory buildup; zero loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (ice singing), varied rhythm peaks at closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of banned aesthetics as heresy transformed through lived paraphrasing; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
