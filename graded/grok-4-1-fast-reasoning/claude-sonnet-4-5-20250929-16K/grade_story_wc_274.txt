<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—terror of mother's fate versus desperation to honor it—embody in trembling hands and vault pulse, earning the activation choice without epiphany shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as letter realization cascades to network pulse and transmit DC; closure cost legible in "some silences must be shattered, no matter the cost," with ice constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow's silent descent and ice vaults constrain retrieval belief while charging final glow image; sensory filter (dizzying quiet muffling thoughts) mirrors internal escalation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hesitation stake tightens via pulse recognition, forcing agency in core insertion; cost felt in inherited fate as options narrow under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silence-as-survival theme emerges via snow/ice images shifting to awakening light, offering resonant answer to inheritance question without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of perpetual snow and pulsing ice sustains rhythmic control; POV stable, compression heightens "blink" pivot under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm—no loops, purposeful figures like "light traveling through frozen pathways like blood"; closure image sharpened without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meteorite-frozen letter and ice-as-network synthesize dystopia freshly; risk in quiet activation heightens conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
