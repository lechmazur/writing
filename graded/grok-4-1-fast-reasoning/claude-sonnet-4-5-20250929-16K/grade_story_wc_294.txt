<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in simultaneous impulses to flee and commit via markers; final renunciation of expansion earned through bill-handling realization. Embodied emotions via dust and fragile bills avoid labels. Minor diagnostic phrasing in "transcendence wasn't transformation" slightly abstracts peak insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with reflective density tightening to CR closure: Luka's marker realization reweights cycle premise with fragile restoration cost legible in "idea felt fragile, like the old currency." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene with backstory shards fits defaults; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Train as micro-setting constrains via markers and creaks, charging final image where it "settled into the earth." Sensory hierarchy (dust exhaling, twilight filtering) reflects calm POV bias. Fox subtly mirrors recognition without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cycle origins) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through bill and marker beats to foreclose predatory paths. Agency in self-dissuasion narrows options with endurance cost. Final trade-off (small restoration vs schemes) charges poise under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patterns (territorial, predatory) emerges from currency trophies and markers, reweighted non-literally by final "breadcrumbs leading away." Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from cycle-breaking question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in calm observations (velvet exhaling dust). Rhythmic prose modulates from dusky detail to compressed realization. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bills as "trophies... reminders" advance character/theme). Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops or scaffolds. Minor register elevation in "aggressive expansion was innovation" fits reflective voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fintech fall echoing robber inheritance via train kingdom transforms redemption trope. Markers as self-binding evolve organically from childhood. Risk in dusky lyric closure heightens quiet stakes.</comment>
