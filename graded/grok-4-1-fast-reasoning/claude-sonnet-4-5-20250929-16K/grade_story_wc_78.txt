<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to harmonize threats is embodied in racing pulse and micro-choices like naming strikes ("Mercy," "Hold"), earning survival endurance with exhaustion cost; contradictory anxiety/control impulses act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as fractal cloud density builds to resonance cadence shift; on-page Charged Poise closure in orchard survival and collapse reconfigures threat with legible exhaustion cost at "Kael collapsed against an apple tree."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Driftwood circle and sea constrain striking choices and charge final apple bite; sensory hums/creaks mirror internal fractals purposefully without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant survival stake tightens accumulatively from cloud warnings to violent tide harmonized by agency in orchard-playing; cost unmistakable in three-hour exhaustion foreclosing rest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming chaos emerges organically via resonance survival; final salt-victory apple offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting obstacles without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in fractal readings and prophetic voice; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in strike sequences without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from "clouds moved wrong" to climax strikes; zero loops or muddle, purposeful fractals enhance peak without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Floating orchard and resonance survival synthesize fresh fractal logic organically; risk-taking in textural premise heightens stakes inevitably toward symphony closure.</comment>
