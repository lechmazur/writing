<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's shift from "professional solemnity" to "searing focus" shows contradictory impulses acting in the trap and debris-arranging beat; final decoding choice earned by retrocognitive immersion with embodied cost of shattered distance. Elijah accessed character-particularly through her felt terror/resolution. Minor summary in motivation dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations densify to CR closure in "Her fingers traced the musical notes, translating them into testimony," reweighting archival distance with undeniable conceptual cost of becoming "a channel for retrocognitive truth." Mosaic shards (zeppelin-lagoon-past-present) taught early via letters/diaries; orientation anchored by ~100 words; one tightening via trap narrows to testimony imperative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and debris constrain trap/arranging choices and charge final reprise as Maya's instinctive message mirrors Elijah's. Sensory narrowing under panic ("black sand") reflects urgency; debris evolution ties internals to action. Zeppelin/desert subtly pressure descent without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archival truth signaled early tightens via retrocognitive trap, forcing endurance with panic cost ("seizing like a fist") and foreclosing distance in debris beat. Agency in decoding/descent/parley witness drives under accumulative lens; moral calculus of "crack in the wall" sharpens peak. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-trap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted truth emerging from buried histories arises organically via cipher-trap-parley to resonant CR image of freed testimony reweighting "solemn keeper" premise without moralizing. Subtext in sheriff's "look away" and Maya's debris echo ambiguity of partial justice. Particulars like musical notes ground without platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with archival perceptual bias ("pressurized cases of fragile histories"); voice rhythms modulate from solemn to searing under trap stress. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("That's not justice... Light gets through cracks") pursues parley goals with idiom distinction. Clean free indirect in Elijah access.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "memory seized her like a fist" advances plot/embodiment); varied rhythm accelerates trap, breathes in reflection. No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent ("yellowed like old teeth," "light gets through cracks"). Concision strategic in shards.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Retrocognitive cipher premise synthesizes history/spec-fic ingeniously, transforming archival trope via trap's lived cost and debris reprise; risk of multi-shard POV slippage heightens stakes coherently. Fresh "musical notes" encryption feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
