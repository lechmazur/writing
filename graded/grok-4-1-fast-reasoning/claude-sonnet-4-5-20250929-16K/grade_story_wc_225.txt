<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between pride and shame act in decoding beats; final forgiveness earned by thread-emotion mapping and palm-on-labyrinth speech with tears as embodied cost. Interiority particular via chess lens and fidgeting under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thread-decoding density tightens to forgiveness DC/RR at "The tapestry shimmered... village exhaled," with exile-as-cost legible in final image of walking free yet disgraced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen village and platinum labyrinth constrain decoding choices; dust motes/ivy/tapestry threads charge final shimmer/thaw image, with thunder evolution mirroring internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness signaled early via curse recognition; agency-driven tightening via thread-sorting/decoding under accumulative lens forecloses regret path at voiced absolution, cost felt in "still exiled, still disgraced."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Forgiveness theme emerges organically from chess pride → thread-emotions → village thaw; final rain-washed memory but "lesson woven permanently" reweights premise without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile thread-perception and chess metaphors; voice rhythm modulates from poised decoding to charged "I forgive myself," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative weave ("sound like a whispered secret"); varied rhythm propels without loops, peak forgiveness beat clear and propulsive.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms frozen-time trope via emotional thread-labyrinth puzzle; chess-exile synthesis feels inevitable, risk in abstract "corridor of justified anger" heightens closure ingenuity.</question>
