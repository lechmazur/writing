<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's uncertainty flaw drives contradictory impulses (fear vs. narration/repair) embodied in trembling hands and self-narration, culminating in earned choice to pour her essence with felt cost. Interiority particular via grandmother's legacy and charm. Final realization integrates flaw without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: essences build resonance, tightening via tilting workshop and rising wave to Charged Poise closure (light erupts, sea calms, statue breathes) with conceptual cost of embracing uncertainty legible in "vessel waiting to be filled with gold."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid sea and gears pressure choices (tilts force feverish work); statue pockmarks as recurring "micro-setting" constrain matching and charge final fusion image. Sensory selectivity (hissed acid, churning sea, glowing vials) reflects Mira's urgency, POV bias toward repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete statue before destruction) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via resonant glow and cathedral wave narrowing options; agency in final pour forecloses escape with visible cost (panic fought, uncertainty surrendered).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from vial-matching to tapestry fusion, reweighting breaks as luminous; final image ("statue seemed to breathe") offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, though narration edges toward direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (pockmarks as map, emotions crystallized); rhythmic narration modulates stress (third-person steadying), purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propulsion (e.g., "each depression corresponding to a specific memory" integrates world/character/action); varied rhythm accelerates in climax wave without loops or figurative muddle, clear syntax under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical kintsugi on acid sea transforms tropes via pockmark-map realization and memory-quilting; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
