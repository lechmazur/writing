<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to chase legends shifts credibly to seeking darkened truths, earned via discoveries; interiority concrete in "hindsight clarity washed through him like cold water." Minor diagnostic phrasing like "thoughtfully clear precision" slightly undercuts embodiment but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries deepen knowledge toward CR closure: final image of pocketing sundial and walking with purpose reconfigures legend-seeking with conceptual cost of obscured truths. Orientation anchored early in canal/twilight; one tightening via maps suffices. Cost legible in "hindsight was the only clarity that mattered."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "amber reflection and diesel shimmer" and "deck groaning" filter through Marcus's myth-seeker bias, evolving with dawn to charge final barge silhouettes dissolving. Sundial as micro-setting constrains realization and pockets into closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover "architecture of lies" signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sundial/maps to foreclose legend-chasing with realization cost. Agency in salvaging maps drives deepening; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of spectacle obscuring truth emerges organically from legend shelling Dessen's tragedy; final image non-literally answers seeking question by reweighting myths as lies' architecture. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in myth-attuned noticing like "industrial ghosts"; voice texture modulates rhythmically, e.g., short sentences in hold discovery build intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative like "question mark in the twilight" integrated into action; rhythm varies without loops or scaffolds. Minor repetition of "understood" contained, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of legend-hunt revealing industrial cover-up via sundial grief twist; "architecture of lies" inflects turns organically from prior particulars.</comment>
