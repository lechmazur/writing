<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority ties grief to polymer expertise, with embodied emotion in water disruption; micro-choices like recording notes reveal values under pressure. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("pieces began falling into place") borders rational summary, but closure choice to resume lab work feels earned with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations densify from foam to chrysalis, culminating in CR where grief reconfigures as continuation ("not an ending, but a transformation"). Orientation anchored early (ravine, Daniel's accident); cost legible in loosened grief foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Braided streams and foam constrain insight, charging final golden light image; sensory details (cold water, singing rhythms) filter through symphonic/chemical POV bias. Recurring foam evolves causally with her actions, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement amid grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening observations narrowing to realization; agency in disrupting foam forces trade-off between past blockage and forward commitment. Cost felt in grief's loosening, charging phone notes as peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of separation-as-reconnection emerges organically from foam/chrysalis particulars, reweighting research paths in final stream harmony image without moralizing. Resonance from polymer/nature synthesis avoids platitudes, lingering via ambiguous transformation cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with symphonic/chemical perceptual signature; rhythm modulates from blocked reflection to fluid insight, diction biased toward molecular metaphors. No head-hopping; compression in observations feels voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful repetition (foam patterns) advancing texture; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor register elevation ("symphonically minded brain") fits POV but risks academic drift in peak insight beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science, nature observation, and grief transforms trope of natural epiphany via specific chemical/symphonic lens. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in convergence reweighting; no template echoes.</comment>
