<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Queen's disenchantment embodied in distant kingdom concern and scraped hands under pressure; contradictory duty vs. dreams impulses act in climb refusal and steady confrontation with old woman. Final purpose renunciation of despair earned via visions. Minor epiphany smoothness at "she understood" slightly unearned but does not touch closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream density -> climb texture -> grotto visions tighten to fireflies CR, reweighting dreams as choices with felt purpose cost. On-page closure legible in shared exhale moment. No orientation debt; single arc fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto and bleeding walls constrain revelation choice; ember grotto and fireflies charge final image mirroring heavens. Sensory selection (weeping light, mist-heavy gown) POV-biased and purposeful. Spatial choreography coherent through ridge to edge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams) signaled early, deepens via branching futures tightening options to act/return. Accumulative pressure in physical toll and visions forecloses despair path with kingdom neglect cost. Agency in climb and watching crystallized at exhale; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mysteries as thresholds emerges via bleeding light shift from wound to invitation, resonant in fireflies non-literal answer reweighting certainties. Subtext in old woman's menace and queen's confession avoids moralizing. Complexity in salvation/devastation ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third POV with perceptual signature (disenchantment tinting kingdom as "thick glass"); diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled, modulating from mist cold to pulsing warmth. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing voices. No head-hopping; compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative language (lacy menace, bleeding starlight) purposeful without muddle in peak exhale beat. Minor density in opening dreams but no loops or scaffolds obscure closure. Propulsion aligns with climb escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophetic climb and fireflies ascent transforms queen trope via grotto physics and choice invitation. Risk in lyric CR heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes; particulars (cobalt bruises) memorable.</comment>
