<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Miren's embodied foxglove regret and contradictory purpose-sorrow impulses act in scene via systematic choices; final tending earned by prior discoveries with visible cost of shattered orchid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as resonances densify from cracked chime to new harmony; Charged Poise closure reconfigures preservation via glass chime image with conceptual cost of extinct feelings' persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal walls and glass orchids constrain choices (precise conditions, rotation) and charge final twilight image; recurring glass fragments as micro-setting enable new chime payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve orchids tightens via recording discovery narrowing dissonance risk; agency in playing songs and fashioning chime forecloses loss path with on-page cost of unsaved orchid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving erased emotions emerges via orchid resonances reweighting Severance premise; final unnamed emotion offers non-literal answer charging prior marvels without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (emotional crystals as notice bias); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in resonance beats, elisions taught early via chime crack.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and multi-job lines; no loops or scaffolds, figurative coherence in glass shadows/light integrates without muddling peak discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystallized emotions and sonic preservation transforms relic tropes; risky opal-song conceit inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via new frequency discovery.</comment>
