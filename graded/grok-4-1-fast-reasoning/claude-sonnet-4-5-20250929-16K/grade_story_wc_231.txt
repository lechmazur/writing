<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margit's motivation to decode the gesture roots in consistent observational traits, intensifying via borrowed memories to compel the release; interiority particularized in "observing gaps" and embodied temple-pressing. Contradictory impulses peak in holding the flower over water before letting go, earning stasis with felt lighter solitude. No safety-hedging; flaws like isolation complicate toward poignant endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: memory density builds knowledge from fragments to full revelation, culminating in CR closure as Margit releases the flower—"The memories left her immediately"—repricing preservation with conceptual cost of impermanence legible on page. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory vividness (wetly gleaming dock, mist merging sea/sky) filters through Margit's keeper bias, constraining choice via dock's site of discovery and charging final release image. Nautical twilight evolves causally with mist fading, mirroring internal reconfiguration; recurring flower handled tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through deepening memories revealing tech/grief, narrowing to renunciation; agency in investigation forecloses preservation path with on-page cost—"her own solitude, which felt lighter now." Escalation driven by protagonist's attention under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-ghost emerges organically from particulars (gaps in memories, flower's sink), final image offering resonant CR repricing without moral: "permission to let go." Subtext in gaps/silences invites ambiguity; no tidy assertion, complexity in grief's beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in gap-observations; voice texture poetic yet controlled ("waves wearing down stone"), modulating rhythm to emotional peaks like release. No head-hopping or withholding; diction POV-plausible for weathered keeper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "softly persistent, like waves wearing down stone" advances character/atmosphere); varied syntax/rhythm propels to closure, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent and sparse. Read-aloud natural; final line recharges beam motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural-tech in Edelweiss with lighthouse isolation transforms suicide trope via lived grief particulars; risk in memory-transfer premise commits fully, inevitable hindsight in release gesture. Non-obvious angle on preservation elevates beyond template.</comment>
