<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's wilting leaves embody contradictory impulses reacting to dishonesty/straightness to truth in pivotal beats like Kade's "I'm scared," compelling her invitation and etching; final strengthening earned via archive truths with visible cost of prior thinning. Kade applies targeted pressure without stock convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment discovery accumulates to map-archive etching for CR closure where final plate-reading reconfigures lie-world premise with cost of unspoken truths' wait; orientation anchored in first paragraph, shards transition legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Toxic sky pressing glass and gold-veined leaves constrain choices (enclosed survival) and charge final blooming image; selective sensory hierarchy (amber light, humming recyclers) mirrors internal wilting via Mira's biased filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-healing amid lies) signaled early, textural deepening via Kade's candor and archive etching narrows options with embodied cost (leaves unfurl, "less now" trades isolation); agency crystallizes stance coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilient candor emerges implicitly from leaf-reactions and etched plates, final CR image ("something...began to bloom") non-literally reweights scarcity-lies without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with leaf-perceptual signature biases noticing (droop to Kade's "hollow brightness"); dialogue subtext-driven ("Why waste time" evades, "I'm scared" advances); rhythmic modulation under discovery pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "zinc-etched postal plate fragment" propels discovery); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure image of blooming leaves.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Leaf-wilting on lies plus essence-capture archive transforms post-apoc scarcity into fresh truth-preservation angle; risk of hybrid biology/psychic leaves heightens stakes organically.</comment>
