<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—methodical restoration clashes with playful "imagined conversations" turning real—forcing micro-choices like singing experimentally; final renunciation of certainty earned by thinning memories' cost, with embodied pulse and warm nickel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via nickel's evolution and mural shifts to CR closure ("each awakening revealed another layer... began again") with conceptual cost of eroded certainty legible in thinning memories; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity, persistent constraint in sound responses shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains choices (singing note returns as "Are you certain?") and charges final image (garden "sang her deeper"); sensory hierarchy sound-dominant via POV's professional ear, selective details like humming pathways integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nested reality vs. certainty) signaled early, escalates texturally via awakening repetitions narrowing to invitation; agency in pressing palms/singing forces trade-off, cost unmistakable in "memories felt thin, like paint watered down" charging Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty's value emerges organically from particulars like nickel's grin mirroring Marta's; final image ("Marta pressed both palms... Wake up again") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity via nested layers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sound-biased noticing ("every surface sang back"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity (overlapping breathing waves to spiraling notes), purposeful compression in awakenings taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with lines multi-tasking (e.g., "The garden caught it, shaped it, sent it spiraling" advances sound rules, stakes, action); minor paraphrase in "waking" motif purposeful under lens, no loops/artifacts dulling closure image, varied rhythm passes read-aloud.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hobo nickel in sonic murals transforms dream trope via acoustic rules and restorer's trade (certainty to curiosity); risk in nested structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from coin's evolution to grinning reflection.</comment>
