<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—art as work vs joyful creation—embody in tracing the fresco child's hand, earning her laugh and breath-release as a meaningful change with visible cost in dimming batteries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup from discovery to projection/streaming; CR closure in "joy wasn't lost... right here" reconfigures stance with undeniable conceptual cost in fog-erasure and thinning mist, oriented early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog as diffusing canvas and orchard skeletons constrain projection choices while charging final image of swallowed footsteps; selective sensory hierarchy (echoing steps, silver bark) mirrors internal rediscovery without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early tightens accumulatively via amplification to streaming, forcing trade-off in battery drain; agency in inventing fruits narrows solo creation to connected resonance with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral joy emerges organically from light-fruit amplification shifting the fresco child's want to abundance; final image reweights reaching/wanting without moralizing, resonant via fog's erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in light/fog metaphors; rhythmic modulation peaks in "pensive mirth" laugh amid melancholy, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "fog pooled like spilled milk" propels without loops; minor figurative density in projection beat risks slight overwrites but serves accumulative texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting on fog-canvas transforms ruin-tour trope; risk in ephemeral "edible stars" heightens joy's rediscovery, inevitable in hindsight via fresco trigger.</comment>
