<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coachman's wisdom rooted in river experience drives patient guidance; woman's desperation yields earned shift from legal layers to needle's essence, shown in embodied clutch loosening. Internal conflict via contradictory rush vs. patience impulses acts in dialogue. Minor tidiness in epiphany at "I've been so focused... I forgot" avoids full 9+ contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via fog/dialogue to RR closure in woman's lighter step and needle light-catch, reconfiguring desperation with conceptual cost of rewritten simplicity. Orientation anchored early in coachman/river setup. Single scene fits defaults; cost legible in dawn deadline met via percolation wait.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog, mist, ticking gutters constrain wait-choice and evolve causally (thinning reveals shore), charging final dawn image. Sensory hierarchy (auditory ticks, tactile moisture) reflects coachman's ambient bias. Micro-setting (lanterns, ferry planks) mirrors internal percolation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dawn contract) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dialogue-deepening that shifts woman's knowledge/options. Pressure coheres in weather/time; agency in shared wait/insight forecloses frantic rush with felt relief-cost. No reversal needed; cadence reweights essence over layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of layered meaning distilling emerges organically via palimpsest/yarn parallels, reweighted non-literally in final needle-lantern image without moralizing. Subtext in coachman's faint smile percolates resonance. Protagonist arc inextricable from perceptual shift; ambiguity lingers in life's rewritings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with coachman perceptual signature (river moods, fog ideas); voice modulates serene rhythm to charged dawn. Dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via indirection ("distill complexity"). Minor register elevation in metaphors consistent with tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "fog pressed thick as wool" advances atmosphere/causality). Rhythm varies read-aloud; purposeful metaphors like "percolate differently" without muddle. Minor repetition ("rain gutters," "percolate") purposeful but caps at 8s; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coachman as percolating mentor at liminal crossing transforms epiphany trope via ambient/river philosophy. Risk in lyric metaphors heightens stakes without gimmick. Needle/palimpsest particulars feel inevitable; no derivative templates.</comment>
