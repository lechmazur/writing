<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Renna's obliging nature conflicts with her secret drive, embodied in wishing to continue her experiment yet following Voss, culminating in earned vulnerability when admitting fear before sharing the hologram.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to hologram reveal; on-page CR closure via Voss witnessing sideways time, with legible cost in Renna's fear and potential disbelief made explicit in her admission line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moths' hush and crystalline wings constrain Renna's secret work, charging the final image of stirring wings against the nexus pulse; selective sensory details like "silk dragging across metal" filter through her mechanic priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to validate sideways time tightens accumulatively via repair interruption then hologram activation; agency in pulling lever and sharing forecloses isolation with vulnerability cost, felt in Voss's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of perception beyond assigned roles emerges organically from Renna's mechanic discoveries; final image of nexus promise reweights seeing time as landscape, resonant without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward mechanical details and light effects; dialogue natural with subtext in Voss's "mechanically warm" correction advancing validation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose propels via varied syntax matching wonder crescendo; minor repetition of "mechanically warm" contained, density high in hologram description without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobiology, holographic time-warping via moths transforms physics trope into sideways landscape discovery, riskily lyric yet coherent.</comment>
