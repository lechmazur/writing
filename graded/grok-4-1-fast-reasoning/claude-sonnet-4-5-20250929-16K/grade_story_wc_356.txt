<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Endurance during bloom's "three days and nights" reveals contradictory impulses (nausea vs. witnessing), earning transformation via prior journaled motivation; embodied reactions like trembling hands ground specificity without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from planting to bloom overload, delivering Charged Poise RR in "I am the stillness" journal entry and final sway image; cost legible in endured nausea, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Treetop sway and platform-edge pot constrain planting and parallel internal stakes, charging closure's "swayed with it, completely still inside"; sensory filter via smell biases details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory stake tightens decisively at bloom's "stench arrived gradually, then overwhelmed," forcing endurance agency with nausea cost; accumulative pressure reweights serenity pursuit without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of presence amid disturbance emerges via bloom ordeal and petal-pressing, resonating in final image without moralizing; minor slip in "underground river" near-articulation slightly undercuts emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Olfactory-biased perceptual signature consistent in journal entries like "faint musk, like distant thunder"; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm to bloom intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensory image, and reflection seamlessly; no loops or muddled figures, rhythm propels via varied lengths through "waves of nausea" peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Corpse flower as serenity tool transforms stench trope through olfactory endurance, synthesizing treetop motion with internal mastery for fresh premise; bold risk in quiet CR closure pays off.</comment>
