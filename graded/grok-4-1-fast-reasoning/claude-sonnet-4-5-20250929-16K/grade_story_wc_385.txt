<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to uncover echoing intensifies credibly through concrete actions like pressing the seashell to the wall, with embodied realization when her voice splits. Interiority feels particular via sound-focused perception, avoiding stock phrases. Minor slip: epiphany at "We are the children of the nexus" borders unearned without deeper prior contradiction, but micro-choices anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer density from Veshar's split voice to Kael's own, culminating in CR closure ("both her voices harmonized perfectly") with conceptual cost of redefined role. Orientation anchors early (nexus, echo singer). One tightening via self-echo suffices; structure coherent over nights without shards exceeding scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Seashell and stone walls constrain choices (listening, singing) and charge final image (pulsing against heart). Sound hierarchy reflects POV urgency; starlight filters subtly mirror layered truths. Sensory integration vivid and purposeful, e.g., "universe hummed its secret song through the rock walls."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn echoing's why) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via network revelation to personal split-voice deepening that narrows her prior role. Agency in progressive listening/singing forecloses mundane duty with felt cost in harmonized singing. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of layered truths emerges organically from echoing discoveries, final harmony reweighting "protect it" without moralizing. Subtext in dual voices invites ambiguity on guardianship vs. conspiracy. Resonant via particulars like lingering reverberations, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature (e.g., "voice carrying words... without interception"). Lyrical rhythm modulates from melancholy to purer understanding, prose texture distinct and controlled. Minimal dialogue natural in sparse use.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful sonic repetition (echo, whisper) building texture without loops; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "chambers of a vast seashell," but coherent and closure-clean. No scaffolds or filter stacks dull peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic layering as shadow governance transforms intrigue tropes organically. Echo people's dual voices inevitable from setup, risking bold conceptual premise without gimmick. Final reconfiguration ("souls" layer) heightens stakes uniquely.</comment>
