<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—pride in past deceptions mended into evidence via marbles—act simultaneously in her polishing and risk of dismissal, earning the final vindication; Marcus applies secondary pressure as horrified foil without stock flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of marble unearthing and revelations tightening to garden's dawn response (RR/Charged Poise) with cost of tanked metrics legible in "deliberately tanked your measurements"; orientation anchored early in maze excavation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden maze and cracked marbles as micro-setting constrain choices (junction excavations) and charge final image of hedges reaching toward positioned marbles; sensory hierarchy (brown dye emerging, fractures as copper veins) reflects Elara's botanical bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove garden recognition over metrics) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deliberate neglect explanation and dawn tightening where garden response forecloses dismissal with agency in resumed care; cost felt in Marcus's horror and her preparation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love surviving measurement emerges from marble particulars shifting to proof in garden's response, final image ("sun caught every crack... damage into testimony") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting metrics premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in botanical diction ("interring them like seeds of memory") biases noticing; dialogue natural/subtextual (Elara's "Gardens know their gardeners" vs. Marcus's algorithmic frown) advances stakes with idiom distinction; stable close third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., polishing integrates action/revelation); varied rhythm avoids loops, minor repetition in marble descriptions purposeful for accumulative texture without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical sentience and marbles as mended memory transforms trope of undervalued elder into inevitable garden response; risk in garden "knowing" pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
