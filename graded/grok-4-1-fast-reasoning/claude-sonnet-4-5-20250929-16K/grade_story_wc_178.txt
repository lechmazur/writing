<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's frugal traits drive micro-choices like counting candle stubs and saving remnants, rooting her devotion amid scarcity; interiority peaks embodied in "pulse quickened" upon irony revelation, earning the covenant recognition without epiphany shortcuts. Contradictory impulses surface in political chaos vs. cosmic constancy, complicating her singular stake. Final endurance—carrying tile forward—forecloses isolation with felt exhaustion cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tile discovery to schematic plotting, culminating in on-page CR where square reveals transcendent covenant, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of finite means vs. infinite mystery. Orientation anchors early via palace violet hour and Mara's habits. No shards/transitions; single scene coheres to charged closure image of tile in satchel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reimagined palace constrains via scarce paper/instruments and frugal candlelight, filtering through Mara's astronomer bias; sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile tile coolness and amber glow amid cooling floor. Setting charges final image: morning star above terraces prompts telescope climb, mirroring internal harmony. Details evolve causally from night work to dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode tile for cosmic bridge—tightens accumulatively via ironic 17 ly perspective and orbital sequence, narrowing to covenant realization; agency in meticulous plotting forecloses doubt with exhaustion cost. Pressure coheres sans reversal, reweighting via deepening irony. Final poise feels cost of regime uncertainty on salvaged knowledge.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of timeless devotion emerges organically from tile's encoded "signature" across civilizations, answered non-literally by tile-to-forehead press and satchel commitment amid dissolution. Subtext layers in stars as "constant witnesses" vs. falling regimes. Resonance recharges frugality motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with perceptual signature: astronomical precision colors diction like "celestial coordinates" and "orbital mechanics." Rhythmic modulation builds from meticulous to lyrical harmony—"dusky harmony"—under revelation pressure. No elision/head-hopping; voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, e.g., "Her methods were meticulous, born from necessity—paper was precious, instruments scarce" advances character/setting/momentum. Varied syntax/rhythm breathes with candle-to-dawn arc; no loops/artifacts, purposeful lyricism integrates without overwriting in peak calculations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Babylonian magic square as empirically ironic alien viewpoint map transforms ancient trope into cosmic covenant, risking sci-fi/historical blend grounded in Mara's calculations. Turn feels inevitable from "peculiarities her trained eye recognized," heightening stakes sans gimmick. Voice commits boldly to dusky astronomical lyricism.</comment>
