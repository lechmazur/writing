<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seren's interiority shines in "fingers trembled not from cold but from understanding," revealing contradictory impulses of caution and recklessness that compel the swaps; final shift to keeper feels earned via prior theft training. Minor backstory blocks anchor present choices without flattening pressure. No safety-hedging; flaws like potential wrong choice add real risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via escalating sky density from bleeding suns to shattering wrongness; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with cost in "might choose wrong, might make the sky's wrongness permanent." Orientation anchors immediately in sky/sundial; single scene tightens meaningfully at map reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice spire constrains climb ("ice formed in her eyelashes") and charges final "spire hummed... ice singing"; sky corruption filters through POV urgency. Sensory hierarchy narrows to wind screams, crystallized breath in crisis. Spire/body as micro-setting shapes swaps and hum payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend board or unmake world) signaled early, escalates accumulatively per swap flickering sky, narrowing to final pawn risk; agency in precise theft under pressure. Cost legible in trembling and "calculated yet reckless." One tightening suffices, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth-theft emerges organically from piece swaps ("theft and a gift"), reweighting "even stars need companions" vs. lies; final "greatest theft was stealing back the truth" resonates non-literally via image of burying lies. Complexity in playful reverence avoids tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via wonder-thief lens ("sacredly playful"); rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing in swaps. Purposeful poetic diction ("sky wore honest colors") taught early, legible at charged poise close. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels: each swap line advances cosmic texture without loops; rhythm varies read-aloud, peaking in "wrongness shattered." Figuratives purposeful ("two suns bleeding") without muddle in climax; zero scaffolds, clean propulsion to shadow return.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cosmic chess with hollow truth-pieces transforms maintenance trope via chivalrous theft; fresh synthesis of sundial-map and lie-secrets feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in playful cosmic game heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
