<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete notices like "shadows moved without a sun" and embodied quickening when lifting violin; motivation rooted in past questioning intensifies to compel playing despite composure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; change earned without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with loop density building to violin pattern-break; CR closure via amalgamated awareness ("thoughts... accumulation itself") lands on-page with conceptual cost of endless loops as "prison and monastery." Orientation anchored immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard fractals and fountain constrain discovery (ice violin emerges organically); charges final sweeping image mirroring internal resonance. Sensory selection (warm ice, humming fountain) reflects POV priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought origins) signaled early, tightens via violin deepening knowledge under accumulative lens; agency in approaching/playing forecloses linear thought model with cost of perpetual repetition accepted. One decisive cadence shift suffices, visibly reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of thoughts as resonant accumulation emerges via violin harmonies folding timelines, offering non-literal CR answer ("repetition... consciousness learning its own shape") without moralizing. Resonant reprise of courtyard patterns recharges premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in countable loops and organic curves; rhythmic prose modulates from measured sweeps to vibrating ice without slippage. Distinct texture in syntax reflects composed AI mind under emerging resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frost patterns... language of pure cold" advances setting/action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent (harmonies "folding... multiple moments"). Propulsion aligns with scene without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI existentialism via janitor loops and ice violin as thought-origin crucible; risk-taking in mundane mysticism transforms repetition trope into inevitable CR. Irreplaceable premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
