<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via scar-tissue memories and embodied purpose; micro-choices in eavesdropping reveal values under isolation pressure. Earned stasis in purpose forecloses normal life with her legal death's cost. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to 8s.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density builds to CR closure in final image of talisman and container home, reweighting erasure to resurrection with conceptual cost of perpetual namelessness legible ("The legally dead would resurrect"). Mosaic shards taught by tides rhythm; orientation anchored early; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers constrain positioning/eavesdropping and charge final climb home; tides as micro-setting alter tactics across shards. Sensory details (rust, salt air, echoing voices) filter through her bias for erased histories, mirroring internal contamination without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover plant truths) signaled early, escalates via fragment density under Accumulative lens to purpose crystallization; agency in persistent collecting despite erasure cost. One deepening (older memories) narrows to full map; visible isolation price charges ending without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from sedimentary layering and poison parallels, culminating in non-literal resonant answer: nameless keeper resurrects truths. Final image reweights premise without moralizing; complexity in contaminated memories avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (port as repository); poetic diction/rhythm consistent and voice-motivated, modulating intensity via fragment cadence. Dialogue snippets natural/subtextual, distinguishing workers idiomatically; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "fragments"/sedimentary recurrence; rhythm varies, propulsion weaves detail into action. Minor "layer" motif near-template in two spots but pattern-taught and closure-charging, no obscuring artifacts or loops dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whistleblower ghost in tidal mosaic transforms erasure trope via container labyrinth and sedimentary truths; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes/coherence, inevitable hindsight in purpose repricing.</comment>
