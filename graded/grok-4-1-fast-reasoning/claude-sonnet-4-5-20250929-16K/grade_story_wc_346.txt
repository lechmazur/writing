<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in puppet head crystallizes via embodied loss; contradictory impulses in past hubris vs. final planting earn inward adjustment with self-integrative cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Conceptual Repricing closure as lullaby nests into reality's structure; cost legible in "Mara...let herself become part of the pattern" with puppet's crumble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pane of hush and nested fractals constrain calibration choices and charge final image; selective dusk-gold sensory hierarchy mirrors internal hush, evolving causally with humming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to plant eternal lullaby tightens via patterns opening to her humming; agency in micro-adjustments forecloses salvation path with deepening cost of self-dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lullaby motif shifts from personal song to structural tenderness, resonating theme of love outlasting time without moralizing; final "template for tenderness" reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature of fractal hush; rhythmic modulation peaks in "sang back...first voice," teaching poetic compression for charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to closure; purposeful metaphors like "flowers to rain" cohere without muddle, no loops or scaffolds dulling hush pane integration.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock adjuster planting lullaby via hush pane transforms end-times trope; risk in inward spiral reconfiguration feels inevitable from nested particulars.</comment>
