<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's inherited frustration embodied in "generations of inherited frustration" and nervous confidence in footsteps/smile compel the nail reveal and pivot to poetry; Yoon's gaunt brightness shifts via formulae to earned hope, with micro-choices revealing values under exile pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from Mira's ascent/nail placement to Yoon's scope exam and "When do we start?" delivers Charged Poise closure, reconfiguring exile myth with conceptual cost of persisted scapegoating; orientation anchored by ~100 words in station/cliff/storm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm's "impossible storm, arriving from the wrong direction" and "sky churned with colors that shouldn't exist" constrain isolation while charging final image of howling jet stream vs. internal voice; tactile station (spiral stairs echoing, reinforced windows) mirrors dread/resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of validating Voss tightens via nail's "correction factor" revelation, narrowing from exile myth to seeding potential and poetry plan; Yoon's "They don't want solutions" interruption forces Mira's agency in counter-proposal with felt persistence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emergent theme of silenced truth resurfacing via poetry reweights Voss's "apocalyptic fantasy" through shipwreck codes and nail, resonating in "legacy finally found its voice" without moralizing; final stanzas image answers bureaucratic erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited via Mira's "spongey dread intensified" perceptual bias; dialogue subtext in Yoon's flat "You shouldn't be here" to hopeful "Your great-grandmother would approve" advances goals naturally with distinct idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from short "Rain hammered" to spiraling formulae description propels to closure; minor repetition in "coded stanzas" across three mentions creates slight synonym churn without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coffin nail's microscopic formulae ingeniously synthesize nautical legacy with meteorology, transforming exile trope into poetry-embedded salvation for navigators; jet stream's "strange new song" risks bold conceptual pivot without gimmickry.</comment>
