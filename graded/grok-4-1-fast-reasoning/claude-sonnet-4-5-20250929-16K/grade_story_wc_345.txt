<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation to unite the community roots deeply in her refusal to abandon seeds, intensifying through thinning essence to compel the final message. Interiority shows via sensing fractures and chalking under strain, with embodied emotion in "essence thinned to gossamer." Closure change earned as community inherits her work, though archetypal trustworthiness limits contradictory impulses slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: messages build density from ignored to catalytic, tightening at merchant ship into unanimous vote. On-page closure as Charged Poise in "I CAN REST NOW" with conceptual cost of her dispersal legible in final bell chime. Orientation anchored early in ghost, planet, settlement; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Low-gravity droplets and floating arches constrain watering/pruning actions and charge visuals like rose-gold bridges. Nebula pulses at closure, mirroring respite amid abundance. Sensory hierarchy filters through Mirela's dawn rituals, selective and purposeful without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communal unity signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ignored-to-shared messages then merchant split forcing crystallization. Tightening at "I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY" forecloses hoarding path with visible cost in thinned essence and unanimous refusal. Agency in ghost's messages and Kess's speech drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective inheritance emerges organically from messages catalyzing cross-faction crews to final image of settlers writing new ones. Resonant non-literal answer in "continuing the ghost's work," reweighting strangers-to-family without moralizing. Kess's "brambled" speech layers hope/grief complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person on Mirela with clean collective shift at end; perceptual signature in ethereal chalk/dawn bias. Lyrical diction modulates rhythm for pressure, as in thinning essence. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, Kess's voice distinct and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "letters three feet tall, blazing with spectral light"; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops. Minor metaphor density in openings taught as pattern, pays off without muddle. Closure image crisp, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi ghost as communal architect transforms refugee tropes via chalk messages and low-g orchards. Risk in spectral agency heightens stakes without gimmick; merchant turn inevitable from prior abundance. No close echoes, voice authentic.</comment>
