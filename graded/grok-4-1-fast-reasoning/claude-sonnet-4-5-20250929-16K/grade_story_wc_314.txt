<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between empirical discipline and suppressed sentiment act simultaneously, culminating in the instinctive flame invocation that earns her transformation with visible emotional cost; private journals and locket ground her as particular without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify toward CR closure in the spiraling flame release, reweighting her premise with undeniable conceptual cost; crystal melting provides motivated micro-turn without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard's perpetual dawn dew and light constrain choices by yielding the crystal and starlings that charge the final flame image; sensory details filter through alchemical bias, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harmonizing logic/intuition tightens via starlings' emergent patterns, forcing agency in the flame act with felt cost of suppressed mystery foreclosed; agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of logic-intuition dance emerges organically from particulars like starlings and crystal, answered non-literally in the flame's "logic-that-was-not-logic" joining the sky, reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in scientific-wondrous diction (e.g., "geometrically flawless"); rhythmic control heightens wonder under pressure, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; minor figurative density in starlings beat (e.g., "liquid entity") borders overwriting but integrates without muddle or loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical precision and flocking emergence transforms trope via orchard's eternal dawn; risk in lyric Accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
