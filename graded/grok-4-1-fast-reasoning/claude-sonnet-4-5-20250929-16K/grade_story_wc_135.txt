<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maris's reactive vision constrains choices, shown in staggered waits versus decisive boat test; final navigation earns change with risk of failure mirroring exile cost. Interiority particular via spray-tied visions. Blind spots in obsolete methods drive productive struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vision density builds knowledge, valve channels to maps and proof-run closure (RR/Charged Poise). Cost legible in "patient as the tides" over weeks. Shards taught via intervals; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spray and mist constrain visions and navigation, charging final emergence "with full nets." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (archivist reads patterns). Evolving harbor (weeping cliffs to singing valve) mirrors adaptation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore routes vs. absences/fear) signaled early; valve deepens via directed visions, narrowing to test-boat agency with skepticism cost. Escalation accumulative under lens; proof-run forecloses doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive memory emerges via fragments-to-maps; valve's ports reweight (remembered/forgotten/transformed) without statement. Final singing "spaces between notes" resonant CR answer to loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (mist patterns, salt forgiveness) biases noticing; stable close third. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("sea hasn't abandoned you"). Rhythm modulates with visionary intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "navigated absences" advances plot/character/theme). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative purposeful (foam dissolves like records). Propulsion peaks in proof-run.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spray-archivist maps absences via valve ports transforms lore trope. Risk in mythic tone pays off in grounded proof-run; inevitable hindsight via reactive gift.</comment>
