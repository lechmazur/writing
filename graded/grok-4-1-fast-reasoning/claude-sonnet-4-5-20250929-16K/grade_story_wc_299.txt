<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is embodied and particular, with shame from PBS failure driving contradictory impulses—he hides behind loupe until woman's tremor forces eye contact and a gentler truth. Final endurance (tacking cloth) earned via prior micro-choices under pressure. Secondary woman's pressure coheres without overwhelming; voice distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cloth exam to interaction to final CR (tacking cloth reconfigures purpose with felt shame-cost). Orientation anchored immediately (quarry trailer, Marcus appraising). One tightening via woman's denial narrows to "smaller truth"; closure image undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry trailer and dust motes constrain perception and charge final image (echo valley mirrors internal hollow). Sensory weave (cloth smell, creak, light) POV-filtered via expertise; quarry evolution subtle but purposeful. Micro-setting (loupes, desk) guides choices without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraising literal/metaphoric worth post-failure) signaled early, deepens texturally via interaction forcing relational trade-off. Agency in micro-renunciation (offering "smaller truth") forecloses hiding; cost felt in his shame. Escalation coherent under lens, charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (meaning from fragments post-loss) emerges via particulars like cloth and quarry, reweighted in final tack-on without statement. Subtext in silences/gestures; resonance from irony of his roadie past. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (gear expertise filters noticing). Dialogue subtextual/natural ("My father never lied" tremor reveals stakes). Rhythmic control modulates; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel accumulatively; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor repetition of "facts" voice-motivated. Opening anchors stakes; final image recharges cloth motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: roadie expertise → appraiser doubt via fake Woodstock cloth transforms trope. Quarry echo reweights premise organically; risk in quiet CR pays off without gimmick.</comment>
