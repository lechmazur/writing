<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's contradictory impulses—forgiveness vs. hairpin's anchoring weight—act simultaneously upon recognizing the soul, earning her decisive reveal and guidance with visible cost in sustained presence. Interiority particular via light patterns and crane hairpin; soul applies targeted pressure. Minor reflection anchors cleanly to present without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to pool gasp, hairpin reveal, realization "This was why she had come here," landing Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of confronting past in cycle. Orientation anchors early; single scene coherent, closure cost legible in final tree climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pearl-bark trees and Pool constrain choices (climbing for clarity, reflection forcing witness); hairpin as recurring micro-setting charges final pocket/reprise. Sensory hush and mist/darkness mirror internal tension, integrated via action. Final image of clouds below recharges grotto's luminous contradiction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide soul amid resurfaced pain, seek contentment) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via recognition and reveal narrowing to wisdom choice; agency in "Choose wisdom" forecloses suffering path with felt cost in Mei's clarity. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; no coincidences resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of contentment as presence-with-pain emerges organically from pool witness, hairpin show, to "purpose married to peace," reweighting cycle premise non-literally in tree climb without moralizing. Subtext in soul's gasp and light steadying invites ambiguity on forgiveness's limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: hush-inflected noticing of light/souls, biased toward caretaker patience. Sparse dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("You destroyed much"); rhythm modulates from hush to dawn-like brightening. Prose syntax reflects poised mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short gasps amid flowing hush); metaphors consistent (scalloped shells, pearl-bark, wheel) without muddle, propelling to closure image. No loops/artifacts; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: afterlife caretaker confronts daughter's killer's soul via hairpin, transforming forgiveness trope into textured cycle wisdom. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes; hairpin/trees feel inevitable, non-obvious.</comment>
