<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via shadows unfurling and fragment warming, with micro-choices like directing to window revealing values; leaders' trembling hand and cracked voice earn relational shift. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "courage...mapping empathy onto action" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with glimpses building density to Charged Poise closure in leaders' smiles and "Tell us how"; cost legible in "voice cracked like spring ice" and shared scars foreclosing feud path. Orientation anchored immediately in orchard room with leaders.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard trees pressing windows and ice floes groaning constrain Kael's point to boys' collaboration, charging final image; selective sensory details like salt-wind fruit mirror breaking/reforming stakes without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant feud stake tightens accumulatively via mirror glimpses reweighting knowledge, forcing stance crystallization in fragment-sharing; cost felt unmistakably in trembling and cracked admissions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconstituting fragments emerges organically from crystal/mirrors/ice parallels, resonating in final shadows dancing without stated moral; boys' laughter recharges shared roots motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward shadows creates distinct poetic texture modulating from fog-thick breath to light-filling room; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual in "I remember everything."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully from thick suspension to laughter ringing; high figurative density purposeful in shadow motif but occasional overwriting like "weighted breath...thick as fog" risks muddle in opening. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadow-sense via tarnished mirrors transforms peacekeeper trope into fresh synthesis of empathy/revelation; risk-taking in orchard-on-ice premise inevitable in hindsight, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
