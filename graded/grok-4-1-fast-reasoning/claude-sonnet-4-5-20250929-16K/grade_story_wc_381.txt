<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy drives all actions consistently, rooted in grandmother's teachings. Interiority concrete in trance focus, but lacks on-page contradictory impulses or embodied flaws complicating the smooth success. Final endurance in solitude earns closure without deeper struggle shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: awareness ripples gather embers hour-by-hour to source. Orientation anchored early at brook. Closure as Conceptual Repricing—"ignorance... truest salvation"—lands on-page with conceptual cost of foreclosed transformation, wing crumbling as charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details selective (cricket songs, rustling, burbling brook) filter through summoner's priorities, anchoring micro-setting. Brook as anchor constrains trance; stiff legs at rise charges final image with bodily cost. Purposeful nocturnal haven evolves to dawn sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hush prophecy before alignment—tightens accumulatively via spreading embers traced and gathered. Agency in trance erases memories, narrowing to source with five-day clock. Felt cost in effort ("hour by hour... legs stiff") alters final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as salvation emerges organically from prophecy's vulnerability to consciousness. Final smile in solitude offers resonant non-literal answer: "ignorance... truest form of salvation," reweighting whispers into hush without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: mystical bias in "ripples on still water," "embers scattered." Lyrical rhythm modulates from nocturnal breath to dawn hush, diction purposeful and biased. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, syntax supports trance expansion ("feeling her consciousness expand"). Minor figurative density ("smoke through silk") purposeful for tone, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image of crumbling wing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prophecies feed on attention, hushed by mapping silence—earned through grandmother's code and trance mechanics. Risky lyric accumulation transforms prophecy trope; final conceptual repricing feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
