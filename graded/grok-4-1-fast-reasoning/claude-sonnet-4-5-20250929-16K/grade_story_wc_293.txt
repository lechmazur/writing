<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maria's "dynamically observant" trait drives concrete micro-choices like peering through the flake and scrambling down, earning her final witness commitment with embodied "luminous disbelief" that forecloses skepticism without tidy epiphany. Internal conflict pulses in chest recognition of unknown names, rooting motivation to sculpt possibility in fiddle life. No safety-hedging; flaw of prior metaphor-only songs confronts literal truth at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: flake discovery links to wrap viewing, tightening density to CR closure where final note/harmonics reweight bridge-songs premise with witness cost. Orientation anchored in opening truck/pullout. Single scene/shards cohere without ambiguity; hitchhiker's words motivate ellipsis payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap flutters constrain scramble choice and charge final wind/note image, with selective sensory hierarchy (light slant, thermal updrafts) via fiddler's priorities. Micro-setting (glass flake, pine needles) evolves tactilely, mirroring internal crossings. No white-room; plausibly lived-in West.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hitchhiker secret) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via names/Elisa reveal forcing witness stance crystallization. Protagonist agency in photographing (fails, raising cost) and playing note narrows options to song-bearing. One tightening suffices; cost legible in "suffused with luminous disbelief" commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of literal "names written on wind" emerges via particulars (collodion image to fluttering amnesty), reweighting bridge-songs from metaphor. Final image answers "never" with possibility sculpted, resonant without moralizing; conceptual cost of pixelated forgiveness lingers obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with fiddler perceptual signature (harmonics, cadences) biases noticing; rhythmic syntax modulates from slack bow to suspended note. Voice texture particular in "bridge tone" diction; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "green mesh wrap fluttering" advances setting/action); rhythm varies read-aloud without loops. Minor figurative density ("pixelated amnesty") in reflective beats risks overwrite but pattern-taught via photography fail, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of wet-plate history, fluttering scaffold GPS, and fiddler lore transforms vanishing trope into "inverted" time-map with fresh risk (magic-realist literalism). Final harmonics reply inevitable from priors; bold conceit commits fully.</comment>
