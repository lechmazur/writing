<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's expectantly resigned patience and grandfather's legacy root her motivation, embodied in tracing the rosette and guiding sessions; internal lift from resignation to possibility earned via student progress. Secondary characters like Aisha and Thomas apply crucible pressure through hesitant joining, but group handling limits deeper flaws/contradictions. Closure choice feels motivated without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from single note to braided voices over weeks, with legible time elision via session pattern taught early. Orientation anchored by velvet library and Mira's setup in first paragraph. Closure as RR/Charged Poise lands on final voices rising, reconfiguring possibility with felt cost of dropouts; cost legible in "not certainty, but possibility."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn leaves filter light purposefully, mirroring internal thawing; zither rosette as micro-setting constrains teaching choices and charges final handling/touch. Sensory hierarchy (sounds subtracted, voices braided) reflects Mira's priorities. No white-room; spatial clarity holds across sessions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (braiding divided voices) signaled early via clusters; tightening via hesitant Thomas joining Aisha to full group harmony forecloses suspicion path. Cost visible in dropouts and incomplete transformation. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload; agency in Mira's subtract method and student micro-choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via subtraction emerges organically from noise exercise to voices braiding; final image of rosette in young hands offers resonant CR repricing vanishing arts without moral state. Subtext in divisions yields to listening; no tidy binaries, ambiguity in partial success lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with Mira's perceptual signature (traveled stillness, rosette curves); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density under sessions. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Before we sing, we subtract"). No head-hopping; elision of weeks purposeful and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied syntax/rhythm (short instructions amid lyrical descriptions) supports accumulative build. Minor figurative density ("velvet embrace") pattern-taught early, no muddle at closure. Zero loops/paraphrase; read-aloud ear confirms natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: choir workshop as vanishing art of listening transforms harmony trope via subtract method and rosette principles. Risk in time-elided sessions heightens stakes coherently. No template echoes; specific refugee/farmer voices personalize divisions.</comment>
