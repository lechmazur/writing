<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, with symphonic thoughts and embodied cost in bleeding fingers compelling her endurance; final realization earned by prior setup of vibrations as music. No contradictions, but micro-choices under pressure (precise wire tension) reveal hierarchy of values. Single-POV excellence without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: setup (wires/cracks) accumulates to strumming climax and CR closure ("Silence hadn't killed music... transforming all the world"); cost legible in bleeding and daily return. Orientation anchored in para 1; single scene tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove and sculpture constrain choices (wires to roots/stress points) and charge final image (grove pulsing, hedgehog dreaming); tactile vibrations filter through Mara's bias. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under purpose; no white-room, all integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music in silence) signaled early, textural escalation via density (wires to sway to symphony) driven by agency (strumming); one tightening forecloses easy stop with bleeding cost charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (beauty persists as vibration/empathy) emerges organically from particulars (cracks, wires, sway); final CR reweights premise non-literally ("changed the instrument") with conceptual cost, lingering ambiguity in hedgehog dream.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with symphonic perceptual signature ("patterns like musical notation"); rhythmic modulation builds intensity; no head-hopping, diction controlled and biased to vibrations/music.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm accelerates to climax ("strumming faster, fingers bleeding"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (cracks as notation) cohere without muddle; propulsion clean through peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence trope into vibration-orchestra via tree-sculptor/wires; risk-taking in textural music transforms premise organically, hedgehog image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
