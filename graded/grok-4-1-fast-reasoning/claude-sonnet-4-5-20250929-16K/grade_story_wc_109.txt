<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied sensations like "wind clawed through every crack" and micro-choices (retreating to fire, stepping out to feel hush) reveal obsession's cost in isolation; final writing earns change from observer to mapper without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density builds to CR closure ("she began to understand which way was forward") with conceptual cost in embracing starless navigation; orientation anchored early in fort and fading star.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridge fort and wind constrain movements (pressed against wall, rattled door forces retreat), charging final image of sitting in "marbled hush"; sensory texture (groaning stones, pulsing star) mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode hush tightens texturally as star vanishes, forcing realization that forecloses fear via endurance; agency in listening/writing legible, cost felt in preserved "last moment of light."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as cartography emerges organically from oracle's entries and Maren's addition ("absence speaks as loudly as presence"), resonant CR reweights endless night without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature ("silence so profound it seemed to have texture") modulates rhythmically with pressure, stable POV attuned to hush; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid, coherent metaphors ("layers of gold and cream swirling") propels via varied syntax; no loops, zero artifacts dull peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dying stars and silence-navigation transforms apocalyptic trope via experiential map; risk in textural drive heightens stakes, inevitable in "map the endless night" closure.</comment>
