<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation rooted in 17-year vigil compels traversal with embodied emotion (eyes burn, throat tight, faltering steps); guides as crucible force deepening via star-namings. Internal conflict in shifting sand under feet acts simultaneously with forward motion. Final renunciation of "unused" courage earned by prior stamps, foreclosing self-doubt path with felt cost of years stayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stations build density to CR closure where glowing card reweights premise (courage in vigil), cost legible in "seventeen years at her mother's bedside." Orientation anchored by trailhead (~50 words). One tightening via accumulating stars suffices; fog-lift image pays off veils.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway constrains (narrow mist traverse, winding doubles-back mirrors emotional circling); twilight/ fog evolves causally (settles, approaches, lifts) to charge final image of "each stone distinct." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Maya's burning eyes amid guides' wave-rhythm voices). Micro-object (punch/card) as setting handled tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve courage) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via star-deepening (years stayed narrows self-blame option); agency in endurance/arrival forecloses with on-page costs (patience/grief voiced). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at seventh stamp, fog-lift crystallizing permission with undeniable relational/emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of quiet vigil-courage emerges organically from stamp particulars shifting to "it waited here, in the staying"; final image (stars as map/promise/song) resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in guides' persistent returns to endurance avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (Maya's weightlessness, luminous card); rhythmic prose ("rhythm of waves on sand") modulates intensity. Guides' dialogue subtextual/goal-driven (name stars to advance realization), idiom distinct (shoreline cadence vs. Maya's silence). No head-hopping; elision of backstory cued concretely.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "brass clicked...perfect star" advances plot/charges object); rhythm varies (short punch impacts amid flowing descriptions), no loops/artifacts. Figurative integrated (twilight blanket purposeful, not muddled); final line recharges motifs without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic ferry/ridgeway for caregiving recovery, transforming trope via star-punch constellation and punch handoff. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes (indirect path mirrors emotional); inevitable hindsight in "courage never left" from vigil particulars.</comment>
