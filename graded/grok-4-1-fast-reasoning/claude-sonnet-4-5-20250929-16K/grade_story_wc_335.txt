<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren's contradictory impulses—nervous backward retreat paired with combative tenderness—force Kael's micro-choices, earning her final mirroring walk with relational cost. Distinct voices via curt defiance vs. annotated wisdom. Flaws like rushing complicate and resolve organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tea annotations deepen patterns, shadow-glass reveal reconfigures exile premise. Closure as Charged Poise lands in Kael's backward pause and dusk step, cost legible in "becoming strange enough to go home." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Playground swing's creaking "rhythm like breath" constrains reflective hush, stilling at closure to recharge return motif. Glass shards and warped windows filter through Miren's archivist bias, guiding shard selection and charging final gift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of reversible return tightens accumulatively via tea geometry exposing flaws, forcing Kael's yielding. Agency in reluctant sitting and final backward walk forecloses rushing path. Cost felt in pattern confrontation, legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exile as "invitation to become stronger" emerges from tea/shadow particulars, answered non-literally by Kael's lantern-like resilience. Complexity in bending vs. armor avoids binaries; final image reweights premise with quiet ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third on Miren with perceptual signature in geometric readings and backward tics. Dialogue subtextual—"exiled, not shattered"—pursues mentoring; rhythms distinguish curt Kael from layered archivist. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms, e.g., short snaps like "Sit" amid flowing annotations; no loops or muddled figures. Crisp closure: "The playground swing stilled as Kael stepped into the gathering dusk." Zero artifacts touch peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry and shard archives transform mentorship/exile tropes into fresh synthesis; backward walking risks bold pattern payoff. Inevitable hindsight in "strange enough to go home," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
