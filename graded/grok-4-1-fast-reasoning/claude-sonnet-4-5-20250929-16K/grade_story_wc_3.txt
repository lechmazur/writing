<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Asha's methodical patience and inherited ambitions compel escalating choices from seven failed plantings to the eighth with clay and Akkadian, earning her final endurance of grief; interiority concrete in analogizing heart to tablet, though epiphanies border unearned. Contradictory grief and patience act simultaneously in patient refusal of defeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns in texts, failed seeds, and arbor field build density to CR closure: fruit ripens, transforming grief to pattern-presence with conceptual cost legible in "transforming grief into comprehension." Orientation anchored early in Magnetic Arbor; one tightening via magnetic gate insight suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's field and cloud-floor constrain planting at center, charging final image; sensory hum comforts yet underscores isolation, filtered through scholarly POV. Transparent floor's "clouds rolled like thoughts" mirrors internal transitions purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (germinate/understand transition) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via seven failures to ninth-day growth, narrowing options through agency in analogical planting; cost felt in patience tested, charging closure image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically from seed-to-tree, matter-energy patterns, culminating in resonant CR: "nothing ends, only transitions," reweighting grief without moralizing. Leaves-as-cuneiform shift meaning non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with scholarly perceptual signature in analogical noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to urgent growth observation. No dialogue; diction controlled, voice coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated images; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. "Leaves unfurling like cuneiform wedges" advances propulsion cleanly in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform, magnetic preservation, and Babylonian seed transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in arbor-as-gate heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
