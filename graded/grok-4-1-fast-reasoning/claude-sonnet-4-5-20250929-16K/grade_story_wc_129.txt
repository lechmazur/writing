<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to belong intensifies through micro-choices like boldly offering the sculpture, earning her integration with embodied contradiction between loneliness and sympathetic outreach. Final realization of grafting into the community feels compelled by prior search causality, foreclosing outsider isolation with relational cost. Secondary characters apply targeted pressure via shared stories during searches.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, density of searches builds to pattern break at tag discovery and CR closure: sculptor's realization reweights the premise that search itself binds community, with bittersweet connection as undeniable conceptual cost in final image of pulsing sculpture. One meaningful tightening via collective invitation narrows her options from separate to woven-in. Orientation anchors crisply by para 2; lens holds cleanly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain searches (e.g., checking translucent bark, lowest branch) and charge final dawn image where sculpture pulses with light. Sensory details (prismatic shadows, bioluminescent glow) selective via sculptor's artistic bias, mirroring internal shift from exclusion to fierce connection. Evolving environment (twilight pearl/amber to dawn) reflects emotional cadence without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging signaled early tightens accumulatively through shared searches, culminating in agency-driven sculpture that crystallizes communal bonds with fragile/fierce cost legible in elder's touch and sculptor's ache reconfiguration. One deepening via child’s find forces stance shift without coincidence resolution. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges organically from search particulars, reweighted in CR where tag's prior presence reveals ritual's purpose, offering non-literal answer to belonging via final sculpture image without moralizing. Subtext in communal theories and sculptor's fragments invites ambiguity on loss/memory. Resonance from conflicted wants (individual art vs collective web) inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: sculptor's weaverly lens filters setting (reeds/crystals merge). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing in nights of work; dialogue subtextual (elder/young woman theories pursue wonder). No head-hopping; voice distinct from communal voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "calloused hands and desperate hope" advances char/atm/ stakes); rhythm varies for propulsion, breathing in reflections, accelerating in reveal. No loops, artifacts, or overwriting—figuratives (frozen smoke branches) purposeful, coherent in peak sculpture unveiling. Final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist-outsider trope via ritualized tag-search in iridescent crater-world, where communal mystery transforms passive longing into active weaving; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in CR without gimmick. Particulars (glass fruit, stardust fingers) feel inevitable to belonging calculus; no derivative echoes.</comment>
