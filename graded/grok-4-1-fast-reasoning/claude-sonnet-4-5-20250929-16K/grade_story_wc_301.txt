<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion cracking open at graffiti; final choice to play accordion earned by causal buildup of chronicling as penance, revealing hierarchy of values with cost of raw pain without meds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections anchored to present (graffiti cue) tightens to RR/Charged Poise closure where playing and self-mapping reconfigures before/after; cost legible in "raw solace of finally standing still."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ivy, pump, graffiti mirror internal siege and constrain choice to confront; river stones and ruins charge final image, with accordion as micro-setting handled tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-reckoning/forgiveness) signaled early via avoidance, deepens via graffiti revelation forcing agency in hesitant playing; cost unmistakable in discordant notes and wheezed bellows versus prior fog.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bidirectional forgiveness emerges organically from graffiti image shifting chronicling from penance to release; final river-through-ruins offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting maps as personal confluence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (flow rates, confluences) biasing details; rhythmic control modulates from precise notations to hesitant wheeze, heightening pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax (e.g., short discordant notes beat); zero loops/artifacts, purposeful similes like "green waterfalls" integrated without muddle in peak playing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineer-guilt chronicler with graffiti pivot and accordion playing transforms penance trope; risk of quiet stasis closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable confluence image.</comment>
