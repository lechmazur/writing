<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in father's lessons feels concrete via repeated patch touches, compelling adaptation; embodied emotions in "breath catch" reveal character under pressure. Interiority avoids stock phrasing but edges toward diagnostic in "training kicked in."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: evidence density builds from collapse site to epicenter realization (CR closure via evacuation insight reweighting silence). Orientation anchored early ("Porto Velho," "container labyrinth"); cost legible in "pressure differential still growing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (navigating "metal canyons," wind eddies); recurring containers charge final image ("silent towers"). Sensory hierarchy via investigator bias sharpens vivid, selective details like "rust-orange walls" and echoing footsteps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collapse cause) signaled early, tightens via wind charts discovery narrowing to vortex pressure; agency in survey forecloses structural assumption. Escalation accumulates density under lens, with felt cost in ongoing "labyrinth breathing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated foresight emerges organically from resident charts and her realization, resonating in final "containers hummed... singing their warning." Non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (methodical observation, "hazy precision"); rhythmic prose modulates urgency, diction character-specific (investigator's technical eye). No elision issues; texture distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; purposeful "hazy precision" repetition teaches pattern. No artifacts dull closure image ("touch the patch one final time").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of container city as wind vortex transforms disaster trope; risk in atmospheric collapse payoff feels inevitable from wind charts. Bold ingenuity heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
