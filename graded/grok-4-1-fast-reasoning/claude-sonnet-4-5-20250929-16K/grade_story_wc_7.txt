<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as memory-tasting chef drives pruning choices with embodied sensory interiority; grandmother's teaching anchors present action without flattening pressure. Minor epiphanic summary in "creation and destruction were dance partners" slightly abstracts contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seed plant → prune → moons apex → tree surge reconfigures ruins into beginning (Charged Poise/CR) with conceptual cost of forbidden growth legible in final fruit gleam. Single scene anchors orientation early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse and broken glass constrain clearing/pruning; triple moonlight charges final image, mirroring internal hope. Sensory details (metallic taste, pulsing shadows) filter through chef's bias, evolving with growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grow knowledge fruit via rebellion) signaled early; pruning bad memories tightens via micro-turn, narrowing to resilient ones under alignment pressure. Agency in shears/pruning forecloses crooked paths with felt risk of Council detection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pruned hope-from-ruins emerges via tasting/pruning particulars, final gleaming fruit reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in "quiet act of planting" invites ambiguity on rebellion's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with chef-specific perceptual signature (tasting air/soil/memories); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to surging intensity. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/figurative work (e.g., "proto-roots, building connections"); rhythm varies without loops. Minor paraphrase in repeated "memories" motif purposeful but edges repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of culinary memory-tasting and neural fruit trees transforms rebellion trope; pruning as controlled transformation risks bold ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via chef traits.</comment>
