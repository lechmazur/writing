<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to reawaken beauty drives instinctive choices like playing despite the statue's warning; micro-choice of pressing locust shell to violin reveals hierarchy of values with embodied longing. Internal conflict subtle in sensing orchard's demands; closure purpose earned without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: music therefore trees tremble, statues advance therefore roots erupt, orchard mobilizes—chain tightens to DC closure as trees walk free with statue-crumbing cost legible in "stone returning to stone." Orientation anchored early in sky-bridge and mechanical city; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains via rusted fencing and patrolling statues that force Lira's climb and defiant play; tarnished silver apples charge final image of seeding new ground. Sensory filter (heart-felt music amid gears) mirrors POV urgency; spatial choreography clear as roots wrap fence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to free imprisoned beauty escalates causally: statues' advance narrows options, forcing harder play that forecloses captivity with visible cost in writhing roots and crumbling wardens. Agency in synchronized music tightens pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tarnished liberation emerges from locust shells and uprooting trees shifting from memory to motion; final image of trailing shells reweights mechanical forgetfulness without moralizing. Subtext in "no longer pristine but real" answers reawakening question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic music-noted world; voice modulates from soft melodies to "played harder, faster" under climax stress. Statue's "grinding... millstones" voice distinct if minimal; no head-hopping, elision purposeful in instinctive method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "roots erupted... like serpents" advancing action and image; rhythm varies to propel climax without monotony. Minor figurative density in opening orchard description risks slight overwrit but integrates without muddle at peak uprooting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin-heart rhythms freeing mobile orchard transforms mechanical dystopia trope; tarnished fruit-to-freedom arc feels inevitable from locust shell seed. Risk in walking forest heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
