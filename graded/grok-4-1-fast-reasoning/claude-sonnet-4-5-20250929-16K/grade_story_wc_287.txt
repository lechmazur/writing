<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy and rose petal trigger compels her shift from hiding to leading, with micro-choices like tucking the tooth and angling lights revealing values. Interiority concrete via embodied acceptance of temporality. Children apply light pressure as group but lack distinct voices or contradictions, minor slip not touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from petal drop to lighthouse blaze as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting locks/light metaphor with conceptual cost of tomorrow's questions. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via row to lighthouse narrows to purpose. Closure cost legible in "consequences" felt against persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor, fire escape plants, lighthouse constrain choices (boats borrowed, lights scavenged) and charge final image of blazing beacon/trailing moonlight. Sensory details selective (silver-black water, moon-washed faces) mirror internal reaching. Micro-setting (brass tooth) evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop hiding, reflect light) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via speech to rowing cadence to collective beaming, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in leading/distributing lights forecloses hiding with felt cost of exposure. Tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light slipping locks emerges organically from petal, tooth, lighthouse; final blaze reconfigures persistence over force without moralizing. Subtext in "be light itself" resonates via kids' laughter/experimentation. Charged image answers "how to instill change."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (wistful pragmatism in noticing falls/ripples). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates (whispered steps to oar cadence). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via lesson.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy oar dips amid lyrical flows); no loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful (petal spinning, beams multiplying) without muddle in peak lighthouse beat. Propulsion aligns with accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmiths as light-slipping gardeners transforms tropes via rose trigger, oar rhythm, collective beaming. Risk in symbolic escalation heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
