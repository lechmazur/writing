<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in embodied contradiction—sand "sharp, recent, still being born" contrasts past "silk and marble," earning release of bugs; old woman forces micro-choice without safety-hedging. Minor slip in reflective backstory block ("planned her life and watched those plans dissolve") slightly abstracts a present impulse before prophecy reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from patterns to prophecy to bug release, landing CR closure in "transformation's true texture: it felt like letting go" with conceptual cost of repurposed loss undeniable in final image; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Black sand "hot and granular and alive" constrains kneeling choice and charges final vibration, mirroring internal shift; sensory hierarchy (heat under feet, bug pulses) filtered through Maris's post-loss bias, volcano rumble evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loss to transformation) signaled early, deepens via prophecy ("loss and creation are the same texture") forcing bug release with felt cost of prior accumulation foreclosed; under lens, cadence shift to islanders crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of accidental transformation emerges organically from bug release and sand image reweighting premise (wealth to fate orchestration); final "bugs pulsed in agreement" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, complexity in "best ones are always accidental."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature (noticing "patterns: strangers meeting at precisely the right moment"); dialogue subtextual ("Lost people find the most important things"), natural idiom distinction; rhythm modulates to hush without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"lightning bugs spiraled upward... creating temporary constellations" does image/action/charge in one; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative coherent (volcanic "exhaled heat"); read-aloud ear clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philanthropist-to-prophecy fulfiller via bugs/volcano textures transforms loss trope; risk in lyric hush pays off in charged poise without gimmickry, inevitable hindsight from early patterns.</comment>
