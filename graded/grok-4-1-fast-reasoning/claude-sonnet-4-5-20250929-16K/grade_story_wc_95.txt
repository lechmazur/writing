<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mechanical arm's precise use in catching blade embodies philosopher's inhuman speed and values; Venn's mask crack under pressure reveals curiosity, earning stance shift. Minor slip in overt trait articulation via dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single scene with causal duel-to-revelation linkages culminate in Charged Poise closure: Venn's "I'll bring it to council" with deception cost legible in Theodora's salute and exposure risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Half-painted sundial constrains cipher choice and charges final image of "coded secrets"; glass atrium amplifies clashes, brook bookends tension purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fencing tightens philosophical stakes to cipher reveal, forcing Venn's crystallization under Situational lens; agency in disarm and invitation offer visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sundial incompleteness reweights "order vs. questions" theme resonantly; minor penalty for near-thematic echo in "questions...destinations" line, though dramatized via duel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with philosopher's perceptual bias on shadows/angles; dialogue idioms distinct ("parlor tricks" vs. syllogisms), subtext advances under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with duel rhythm propulsion; no loops, minor overwriting in "amber possibility" doesn't obscure closure image of cleaning blade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coded sundial cipher transforms duel trope into philosophical resistance; mechanical arm synthesis feels inevitable, risk-taking in overlay mechanic heightens ingenuity.</comment>
