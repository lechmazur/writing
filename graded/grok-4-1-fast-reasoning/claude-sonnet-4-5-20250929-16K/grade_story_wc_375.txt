<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's mnemonic curse vividly constrains her with embodied pain (charcoal smudges, trembling fingers on stone), driving contradictory impulses toward self-punishment vs creation; final choice to display feels earned through woman's pressure and letter's weight. Minor diagnostic reflection ("mnemonically gifted curse") borders label-speak but anchors micro-choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cave images and memories densify to Charged Poise closure ("Show me the gallery space"), reconfiguring stance with resurrection cost legible in final climb image; orientation anchored early (cave descent, museum above), single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal cave and headlamp shards purposefully mirror internal sorrow, constraining choices (hidden panel, painting reveal) and charging closure image (rainbows as "nature's own gallery"); body/setting integration (charcoal fingers on stone) filters through Maya's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor brother by uncorking art) tightens via woman's revelation/offer, forcing renunciation of burial with felt opportunity cost; one decisive deepening suffices under accumulative lens, though woman's entry borders coincidence without complicating resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inescapable callings emerge organically from brother's letter, woman's anecdote, and cave reprise, culminating in non-literal resonant answer ("whatever we're brave enough to create"); final image reweights waste into memorial without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (auroral shards, mnemonic details); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You can't rectify his death"), advances stakes; minor elevated diction ("spectral shards") fits artist voice without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with pressure (short sentences at discovery: "The painting was gone."); high density integrates action/image; minor overwrite in metaphors ("hammer blows," "auroral sorrow") accumulates texturally without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic curse, buried canvas/letter, and cave confessional transforms artist-block trope; cave gallery echo and "resurrection" climb offer non-obvious reweighting grown from particulars.</comment>
