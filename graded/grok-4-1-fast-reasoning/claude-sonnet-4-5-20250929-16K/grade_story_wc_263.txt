<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through sensing "silent conversations" and family "madness"; final doorway role earned via escalating bravery against screams, with embodied cost of overload at "She could not hold it all." Minor slip in mother's diagnostic label ("moonstruck dreamer") avoids deeper deduction as it anchors present drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of falling stars and words builds pattern to archway split (DC/RR), with legible cost in "No one could" hold it; single scene anchors orientation early ("northern edge of the forgotten observatory").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora and archway constrain alignment choice ("center of the archway itself") and charge final image of spilling light; selective sensory pulse through "cold granite" mirrors internal screams without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early via "screaming" words; Accumulative escalation via meteor density to pattern emergence narrows options, agency in tracing/speaking forecloses holding via felt overload cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unmanifested potential emerges via star cries ("create... Become") to release ("light made flesh"); final "Begin again" reweights prior entrapment non-literally, with lingering ambiguity of her rest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of hearing "unspoken words"; rhythmic lyric texture modulates intensity ("chorus of everything... denied") without slippage, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("liquid revelation") in buildup but thins cleanly at peak split ("air... split open like a wound"), no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic hearing and stardust memory transforms mystic tropes via astrolabe mechanics; bold lyric fantasy risks poetic voice, inevitable in hindsight at pattern-key moment.</comment>
