<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's trait of hearing unspoken words creates particular interiority and contradictory impulses (loneliness turned purposeful), compelling her rebellion choices with earned change in the children's brighter questions at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build from silence to synchronized displays; resonant reconfiguration closure lands on-page in the library's final chess exchange, reweighting conformity with conceptual cost to hollow quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt library mist and magnetic grotto constrain choices (windows for displays, stones twist lanterns charging defiance); final impossible chessboard recharges these as micro-settings mirroring rule-breaking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive swallowed words) signaled early tightens via synchronized illumination forcing town wonder; agency in organizing forecloses conformity path with felt risk in subtle rebellion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of thinking as breath emerges organically from displays cracking conformity; final "Why can't he?" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting rules without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (unspoken words hum); rhythmic control modulates amplified quiet to brighter questions, dialogue sparse but subtext-driven ("We're not breaking rules").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (mist as questions, flames defying physics); no loops, propulsion peaks in midnight illumination without overwriting at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess rebellion via window displays transforms conformity trope; risk in impossible positions heightens stakes organically to charged final image.</comment>
