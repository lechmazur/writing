<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Earned internal shift from armored rage to vulnerability peaks in "screaming tenderness," embodied via chest calcifying then softening; micro-choice to whisper apology forecloses shouting path with relational cost. Vera's wary arrival applies crucible pressure. Minor epiphany phrasing slightly generic but anchored in prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density builds to Charged Poise RR closure in embrace and "I heard you," reconfiguring seven-year silence with vulnerability cost legible in crumbling faces. Single scene/shards cohere; orientation anchored by ~50 words. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden scent as recurring micro-setting constrains choice (purifies intent for whisper) and charges final image (lingering in air). Sensory hierarchy (night jasmine over visuals) reflects Mara's perceptual bias. Dawn progression mirrors emotional thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile via true intent) signaled early, texturally escalates via scent-deepening that narrows to vulnerable whisper, forcing trade-off (armor stripped). Cost felt in exposed "screaming tenderness" charging poise at dock reunion. Agency in vial-opening and apology crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispers-vs-shouts theme emerges organically from particulars (scent strips pretense), final image of shared whisper offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting rage as masked love. Subtext in Silas's dying words and garden motif avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers in costly vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with scent-biased perceptual signature; voice modulates rhythmically from introspective to terse dialogue. Whispers carry subtextual goal (reconnection) without declaration. Clean free indirect style, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and sensory propulsion; minor metaphor pile-up ("screaming tenderness," "vibrations") in reflection beats risks coherence but ties to voice-motif without obscuring closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts touch ending. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist synthesis of scent-purified intent transforms reconciliation trope; cobalt lighthouse and night-garden anchor non-obvious angle on silence. Risky lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes without gimmick. Bold tenderness tone elevates universality.</comment>
