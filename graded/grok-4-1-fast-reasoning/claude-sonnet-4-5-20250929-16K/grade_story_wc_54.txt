<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation roots in curiosity and thesis work, shown through concrete mapping and action, with embodied stoic wonder; lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices, keeping her competent but untested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to transformation; closure via Conceptual Repricing in final reflection ("Hope... a navigation point") with felt cost of patience over grand vision; summary of work softens on-page immediacy but causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through engineer's lens (water stains as "ancient rivers," ducts repurposed); constrains tactics via flows/solar panels and charges final image under broken skylights.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform terminal) signaled early, deepens via realization-to-action tightening under accumulative lens; low external pressure, costs (time, favors) told more than viscerally felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hope as "flow you redirected" emerges organically from sextant plaque and garden image; resonant non-literal closure reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (professional priorities like "hidden circulatory systems"); rhythmic prose modulates effectively, no dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful figures ("dust motes danced"); no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling propulsion, even in reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport ruins, carnival echo, and sextant as navigation talisman transforms redemption trope; risk in quiet accumulative arc heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
