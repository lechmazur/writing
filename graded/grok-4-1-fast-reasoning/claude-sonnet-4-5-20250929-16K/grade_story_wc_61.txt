<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sentimentalism drives endurance despite patterns, with contradictory hope/grief embodied in "peculiar grief their kind called 'hope'" compelling the seeding choice with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as gear calculations accumulate evidence of patterns toward CR closure in seed release and resumed transit, reweighting eternal duty with "endless disappointment"; orientation anchored early, cost legible in final sonar echoes of "wonder and inevitable sorrow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden constrains via nodes/blooms for gear/seeds, charging final image as "living monument"; sensory sonar/phosphorescence selective through Keeper's bias, mirroring internal serenity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sustain light vs. hubris cycles) tightens accumulatively via gear verdict narrowing to new seeding; agency in endurance forecloses quitting with grief cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hubris repetition emerges organically from gear patterns and seed release; final image resonant non-literal answer, reweighting light's insufficiency without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with alien perceptual signature in sonar/pulse diction; rhythmic cosmic texture modulates from serenity to charged poise, prose as Keeper's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor metaphor density in nebula descriptions integrated without muddle, no loops/scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic gardener enduring failure cycles transforms repetition trope; risk in infinite scale heightens stakes via sentimental persistence.</comment>
