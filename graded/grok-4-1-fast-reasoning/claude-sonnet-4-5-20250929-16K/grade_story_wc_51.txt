<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied actions like orienting the lamp burner under "shingled hush," revealing character-particular motivation to measure infinite burdens; final endurance of endless task earned by progression, though contradictory impulses lean more reflective than simultaneous in pivotal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and held: density of weights builds from calcified coral to merged bronze threads, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure—"To collect them all would be to unweave existence itself"—with legible conceptual cost in trap-as-sanctuary; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and starlight filter constrain choices via alcoves and orientations, charging final image of glowing weights; sensory hierarchy (hush, rivulets, oxidized glory) reflects weaver's priorities, integrated into goal-directed work without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burden-weights) signaled early, escalates texturally through deepening density to infinite tapestry realization, narrowing options to endurance; cost felt in "boundary-lessly trapped" with visible trade-off in extinguishing lamp, charging Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of burdens as interconnected tapestry emerges organically from particulars like coral resentments and bronze shame, resonant non-literal answer in final glowing weights as "pain transformed... into grace"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in trap/sanctuary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractal branches, whalebone reverie); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive hush to charged hush at deepest point, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and image-charged sentences; no loops or scaffolds, figurative pattern (fractals, threads) coherent and purposeful without muddle in peak revelation—"threads, she realized, woven through everything."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractal burdens in bronze grotto transforms tropes of endless labor into fresh conceptual trap/sanctuary; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from lamp orientations to unweaving peril.</comment>
