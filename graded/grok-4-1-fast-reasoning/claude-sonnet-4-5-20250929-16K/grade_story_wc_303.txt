<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in visions versus Kemble's pressure, culminating in earned sketching choice with embodied "mulberry ache" cost. Interiority concrete via palms on glass and fern whispers. Final renunciation of easy path scales perfectly to single-scene scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions densify to Charged Poise closure in sketching blueprint, cost legible in "exile, maybe, or worse." Single scene anchors orientation early; no shards needed. Persistent sunset constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ferns and coffee stains constrain choices (whispers urge, stains show futures) and charge final illuminated path image. Sensory filter (bruised twilight, rustling) reflects perceptual bias. Micro-setting (glass case, desk) guides palms-to-sketch progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticate vs. propagate) signaled early, deepens via stain visions narrowing to empire-vs-dream trade-off. Agency in palm-pressing and sketching forecloses luxury path with on-page ache/cost. Accumulative cadence shift reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of propagation emerges organically from fern cheers, violin song, and blueprint scatter; final music-in-villages image reweights possession premise without statement. Subtext in Kemble dialogue tensions dream calculus. Complexity lingers in perforated futures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (futures in objects/plants); diction/rhythm modulate from bruised light to urgent whispers. Dialogue subtextual (Kemble's hardening vs. Iris query). No head-hopping; elision in provenance opacity serves payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels: each line advances via embodied image (stains "shift, forming patterns"). Rhythms vary (short urgent sentences at decision); metaphors consistent ("light through lace") without muddle or loops. Closure image crackles cleanly.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice violin and stain futures synthesize fresh magical realism on provenance ethics; risk in perforated destinies heightens propagation stakes organically. Non-obvious moral calculus (Empire note vs. seed wind) transforms tropes inevitably.</comment>
