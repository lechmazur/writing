<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Esme's pruner wisdom and creative essence-weaving reveal particular interiority through concrete observation; micro-choices like braiding essences earn the transformation. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, blocking 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from seed placement to weaving; closure as charged poise lands on-page with cost in "hands were cramped, her knees aching," reconfiguring the seed's essence visibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Verdant parapet, mist-shimmered gardens, and waterfall hush constrain weaving (kneeling on wet stone) and charge final image of lingering otherworld glimpses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of wonder-preservation deepens via essence-braiding under accumulative lens; physical cost ("joints protesting") unmistakable, but escalation lacks sharp option-narrowing reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of subtle preservation emerges organically; final "picked up her grandmother's shears and smiled" resonates as non-literal answer, reweighting wonder's continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with gardener-specific perceptual signature ("essence of things," light through leaves); rhythmic control modulates from contemplative to poise-charged close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel without loops or muddled figures; purposeful essence repetition accumulates texturally to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gardener's subtle world-weaving transforms magic-realism into inevitable craft; risk of lyric essence-preservation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
