<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in paint-crusted nails and fragmented portraits; motivation intensifies through embodied urgency as walls close. Contradictory impulses—seeking wholeness yet embracing fragments—earn the final reconfiguration. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "necessary darkness" edges from full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cards to threads to web, culminating in CR where walls stop after final arrangement, reweighting fragmentation as truth with conceptual cost of shattered old vision. Orientation anchored early in stairs/library. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "luminous with necessary breaking."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting constrains via contracting walls forcing speed and beam illuminating threads/web, charging closure image. Sensory hierarchy (salt smell, groaning shelves) reflects POV urgency. Lighthouse beam as recurring object recharges "luminescent ache" at end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redesign vision) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as walls touch shoulders, forcing faster untangling with time cost. Agency in repositioning cards narrows options; cost felt in physical squeeze charging final web.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fragmentation theme emerges organically from cards/threads to infinite faces layered across time, resonant CR in self-portrait scatter without moralizing. Final image ("complete in her incompleteness") non-literally answers wholeness illusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of fragmented features/threads; rhythmic modulation peaks in beam sweeps. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. Distinct diction like "gossamer filaments" fits artist bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (threads "strung with stars"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor density in peak metaphors purposeful under textural lens, enhancing closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist's block as literal lighthouse contraction and tarot fragments mapping selves; tarot web as map of becoming transforms trope organically. Risky lyric CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
