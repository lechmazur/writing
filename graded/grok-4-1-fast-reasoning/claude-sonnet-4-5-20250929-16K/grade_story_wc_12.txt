<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father Micah's motivation rooted in unique methods intensifies compellingly, with micro-choices like layering breath on the loop pedal revealing competence balanced by the entity's resistance. Interiority concrete via practiced "muffled clarity"; Elena's role as crucible forces his probes. Final renunciation of the demon's assumption earned by prior causality, with shaking as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence layers build paradox, tightening via questions and paint to CR closure where "Elena gasped, her eyes suddenly her own" reconfigures possession premise with anchor's settling as conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early in basement chapel. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor constrains via responsive hum/shudder, charging closure; loop pedal and palette as micro-settings handled tactilely, mirroring internal philosophical tension. Sensory hierarchy urgent: vibration, silent scream. POV bias filters breathing walls purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exorcise before completion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via layered silences distracting entity to silent scream. Micah's rhetorical agency forces trade-off, narrowing options; cost in anchor shudder and mutual shaking legible at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of demons as "bad arguments" emerges organically from questions exposing paradoxes, culminating in resonant CR: "You cannot possess what cannot be separated from itself." Final image of gleaming paint reweights human completeness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: "muffled clarity" modulates rhythm under pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("What do you assume?"), advances probes. Prose texture poetic yet controlled, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful silence recurrences building pattern, no loops; rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion syncs to layering (e.g., "He added another layer"). Zero artifacts in peak beats, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop pedal exorcism, white-as-all-colors palette, and rhetorical demon-disproof transforms possession trope organically. Risky philosophical turns inevitable from setup, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
