<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—omitting truths in dialogue while internally agonizing over preservation—act simultaneously, earning her final secret resolve with embodied cost in soot-stained hands. Cassius's shallow breathing ties to traits without stereotypes. Voice distinct in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of revelations (wife's mask, her hidden gallery) builds to Charged Poise/CR at "the chair stopped," reconfiguring vanishing premise with conceptual cost of her deception. Orientation anchored in opening paragraph. Single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rocking chair's slowing rhythm and afternoon light constrain capture urgency, charging final portrait beat; mask as recurring object mirrors internal states through artist POV. Sensory selection (charcoal smudge, wind outside) purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture/destroy/rebuild Cassius) signaled early, tightens via chair's slowing and questions narrowing her omissions under accumulative lens. Cost legible in her "agony" and planned powdering. Agency in micro-choices like incomplete answers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence as mirage emerges implicitly from particulars (burn/scatter vs. secret masks), final shards image offers non-literal CR reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in silences and irony of her truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with artist perceptual bias (tremors in stillness); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (pursues truth while evading). Rhythmic control modulates with chair's tempo to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "charcoal stick moving across paper"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (ashes/shards). Propulsion peaks at "chair stopped."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash-art destruction/preservation transforms deathbed trope via porcelain masks; risk in quiet CR heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight from opening gallery purpose.</comment>
