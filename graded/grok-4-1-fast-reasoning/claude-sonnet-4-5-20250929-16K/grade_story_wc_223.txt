<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's shift from crisis actor to historian of small gestures earns her final role through embodied actions like guiding walks; benevolent ruthlessness shows contradictory impulses acting in ruthless repetitions of survivors' paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as gesture density builds to CR closure in "small gestures refused to die... pawns would be remembered," with cost legible in "dissolve like salt in the great silence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains choices via acoustics that archive walks, charging closure; chessboard's pawn absence as recurring micro-setting mirrors internal states and recharges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving gestures against forgetting tightens accumulatively through method's resonances and ruthless repetitions, with cost felt in survivors' trauma and Mara's endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of gestures "walking themselves into permanence" offers resonant non-literal answer to pawn absence, reweighting collapse's silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature on gestures and absences; colleague dialogue natural, subtextual in "You're still performing," distinguishing voices cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful figures like "nomadic penumbra" enhance texture without muddle in peak archival beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic walks spelling memory transforms post-collapse tropes; risk in gallery-as-archive heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
