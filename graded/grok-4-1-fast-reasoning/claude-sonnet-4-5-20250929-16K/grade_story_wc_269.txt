<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to track paths intensifies credibly through embodied tics like tapping and pulse quickening under data pressure. Internal conflict emerges in contradictory assumptions about maps, earning the realization without epiphany shortcuts. Jin's comm pressure reveals her blind spots diagnostically, but reflective backstory anchors cleanly to present without flattening choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density from data streams to atlas marks matching tidal rhythm, culminating in CR closure: "recovery didn't mean going backward... what it had always been trying to become." Cost legible in reweighted premise and final swaying image. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station's creaking stilts and groaning tides constrain data work and mirror internal drift, charging final "station swayed, moored but moving." Sensory hierarchy (tactile tapping, visual overlays) reflects Maya's priorities without catalog. Post-ban world rules consistent via stabilizing temps enabling path shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disappearing paths) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via atlas pattern discovery narrowing to "returning" knowledge shift. Agency in data assembly forecloses wrong-map options with conceptual cost felt in chest-settling revelation. Coherent pressure to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ocean's memory emerges organically from rhythm-map parallels and coral resilience, answered non-literally by final image reweighting recovery. Subtext in "periodically eternal" avoids platitudes, embracing ambiguity of interrupted cycles. No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic noticing ("three-two"). Dialogue natural/subtextual, Jin's interruption advancing plot without exposition. Prose texture modulates rhythmically with stress, diction fitting scientist under realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., tapping embodies thought/foreshadows); purposeful "three-two" repetition taught early pays off without loops. Varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with scene; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ocean memory as pre-industrial return post-ban, transformed via tapping tide-rhythm motif constraining realization. Risks lyric accumulation over causal plot, heightening conceptual stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
