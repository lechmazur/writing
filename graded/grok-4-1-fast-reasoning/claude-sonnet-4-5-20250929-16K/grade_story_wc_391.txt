<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to sculpt patience from impatience, rooted in her sister's death, compels micro-choices like charting moon-magnetic windows, with contradictory impulses embodied in "restrained wildness of water beneath ice." Final endurance of restraint forecloses wild release with felt cost. Flaws balance competence without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mapping to viaduct passage to waypoint Charged Poise, reconfiguring revolution as glacial with legible cost in "not yet" restraint. Orientation anchors early; closure image of receding sanctuary pays off patient preparation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Basalt, viaduct hum, frozen lake mirror constrain choices via magnetic windows and impassable barrier; sensory hierarchy (magnetic pull, moon paths) filters through Kael's mapper bias. Final waypoint reprise charges image, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient exodus tightens accumulatively via viaduct distortion to waypoint, narrowing options with agency in deliberate steps; cost felt in children's suppressed exuberance and ongoing restraint. Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sustainable revolution emerges organically from glacier/wildfire contrast and moon-ice images; final "moonlight across ice—beautiful, inexorable, and free" offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting impatience's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in horizon-mapping diction; voice modulates rhythmically from preparation to forward poise. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven; minor elevated phrasing fits lyrical restraint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration; minor metaphor density ("ghosts of old impatience") purposeful without muddle. No loops; rhythm varies, read-aloud strong, though occasional scaffold in group description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Magnetic viaduct-moon convergence transforms escape trope into fresh synthesis; patient revolution's glacier metaphor risks bold restraint, heightening stakes organically. No derivative echoes; particulars inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
