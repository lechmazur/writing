<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and motivation shine in tactile page-handling and wall-listening purpose, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or pressured micro-choices, leaving endurance declarative rather than tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Conceptual Repricing crystallizes in final "archive of the human echo...permanent, bronze silence," reweighting premise with undeniable cost of dream-loss/cessation; accumulative/textural lens holds via fragment-density to resonant tightening, persistent axis constraint shaping image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory silo details—rust-script, leaning cylinder, wall vibrations—constrain archival actions and charge palm-press memories plus final tilted-world image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant archival stake signaled early deepens texturally through diary-probe realization of "axis doesn't hold," narrowing to her no-sleep adaptation with legible conceptual cost; subtle pressure coheres without decisive reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance-history theme emerges from particulars like Caroline's entries and wall-whispers, answered non-literally by ledger-copying amid persisting echo, reweighting dream-failure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in texture-braille and whisper-attunement biases noticing; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under reflective intensity, no elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action-atmosphere (e.g., "pressed her palm against the silo's wall and felt its vibration"); varied syntax/rhythm propels without loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh "displaced axis" synthesis transforms apocalypse/dreams into archival inevitability; risky lyric vignette commits boldly to premise implications, heightening stakes via tilted persistence.</comment>
