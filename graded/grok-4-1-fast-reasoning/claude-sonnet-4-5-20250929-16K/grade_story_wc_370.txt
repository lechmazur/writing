<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the hiding beat ("Instinctively, Eleanor moved to hide..."), compelling the earned final acceptance of dual belonging with visible cost to pure solitude. Interiority particular via empathetic sensing of the woman's "protective concern rather than hostility." No diagnostic labels; change scales perfectly to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from invitation cue to library paradoxes to book revelation, culminating in CR closure ("finally home in the paradox") where mistake reconfigures as revelation with conceptual cost of hybrid existence. Orientation anchored early (laundromat, time). One tightening via book deepens stake; lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library shelves of paradoxes constrain choices (pulling "The Courage of Retreat") and charge final image via impossible space mirroring theme. Sensory hierarchy: hummed lights to amber glow narrows with entry. Spatial choreography coherent through descent and hiding; micro-setting (dryer stairs) alters entry tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wisdom from mistake) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via book ("Her mistake had been believing her solitude was selfishness") forcing stance shift at hiding reversal. Cost legible in nod committing to monthly descents. Agency in not hiding forecloses isolation; minor abstractness in ethical calculus holds back 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxes emerges organically from shelves ("truth lived in the space between opposites"), book, and society, answered non-literally in final image ("creases now a map... home in the paradox") reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in silences (woman's gentle distance); earned via particulars, no sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with empathetic perceptual signature ("feeling the accumulated longing... pressed into pages"). Voice rhythmic, modulates calmly under discovery pressure; sparse dialogue subtextual ("Mistakes are simply invitations..."). No head-hopping; diction character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., shelves "whispered that truth lived in the space between opposites" advances setting/theme/action); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Strategic telling in book summary tilts present choice; zero figurative muddle, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dryer-to-library paradox society transforms recluse trope via "staying while leaving" calculus, risking magical realism grounded in tactile entry ("opened the dryer door and found... a spiral staircase"). Non-obvious turns inevitable from particulars; bold premise commitment heightens stakes.</comment>
