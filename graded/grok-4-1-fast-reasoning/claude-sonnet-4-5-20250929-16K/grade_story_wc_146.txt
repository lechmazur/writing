<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as walking density rebuilds rhythm, culminating in Charged Poise closure with bells ringing true and her departure; cost legible in "leaving Millhaven humming... moved on toward the next discordant place," reconfiguring endless wandering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain choices via rhythm conduction in "shivered through the cobblestones"; sound hierarchy sharpens crisis perception, charging final humming image.</comment>
