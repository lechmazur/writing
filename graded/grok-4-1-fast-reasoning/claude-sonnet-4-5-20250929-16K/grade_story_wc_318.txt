<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in "mournfully eager" trembling fingers and half-remembered lullabies, revealing contradictory sorrow-desperation that acts simultaneously; final endurance earned via prior acoustic discovery. Minor idealization of his competence doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from one blower to symphony with leaves/lullabies, culminating in Charged Poise closure where pierced silence reconfigures grief with felt cost ("Not laughter yet—that would take time"). Orientation anchored early in tunnel/estate; one tightening via added machines suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel's limestone acoustics constrain sound choices and charge final image of voices through grates; sensory hierarchy (roars to whispers) filtered via groundskeeper bias. Leaves as micro-setting evolve causally, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pierce household silence) signaled early, escalates texturally via layered blowers/leaves/song narrowing to wild joy amid grief; agency in conducting forecloses total silence with ongoing cost legible in family's partial thaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sound healing unspoken grief emerges organically from symphony particulars, final image of "crack in the silence" offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; brother's line ("sounded like her") layers earned irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct acoustic perceptual signature ("off-key wind that moaned and sang"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, brother's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "sweeping the nozzle in deliberate arcs"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (leaves "macerate" into percussion). Closure image crisp, no overwriting in peak build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Leaf-blower symphony in haunted tunnel transforms grief tropes via grounded acoustics/leaves into fresh synthesis; risk of absurd premise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight with no gimmickry obscuring closure.</comment>
