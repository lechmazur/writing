<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied trauma via somatic freeze and wave-counting micro-choices reveals contradictory impulses toward presence amid grief; photo handling anchors motivation without epiphany. Minor therapy-speak ("somatic markers, body keeps score") borders diagnostic but stays grounded in actions. Earned stasis in lavender work forecloses escape with felt cost of persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine density builds to helicopter trigger, resolving in Charged Poise RR ("Not perfect. Not whole. But enough.") with legible emotional cost. Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph (arboretum pre-dawn). No causality breaks; micro-turn at trigger tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum with glass walls, salt wind, and sea waves constrain coping (palms flat, count waves) and charge final image (fingers in earth, herb scent). Sensory hierarchy plant/trauma-specific: lavender cuttings, soil moisture. Micro-setting (glass, waves) mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (daily functioning amid trauma) signaled early via tasks/children; helicopter deepens via lens (density spike to freeze), forcing endurance agency with visible cost (sweat, blurred soil, incomplete calm). One tightening sufficient; cost unmistakable in "microscopic layers of calm over...fear."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of persistent growth post-violence emerges organically via plants/photo/waves; final earth-pressing offers non-literal resonance to "tend what could still grow" without moralizing. Subtext in joy-prep friction invites ambiguity of "enough." Pearl metaphor reweights survival sans platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature trauma-plant biased (e.g., "seedlings...pushed through overnight"). Rhythmic diction modulates: short freeze sentences, flowing routine. No dialogue; compression purposeful, closure legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows); sensory propulsion in "sharp and clean" herbs anchors now. Zero loops; minor "she" stems natural. Strategic telling compresses backstory; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pearl-of-stillness conceit transforms trauma trope via gardener's lens, synthesizing survival math with cliff persistence. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in charged final image. Fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, no derivative hedging.</comment>
