<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sacrifice at climax earned by prior despair (abandoned weave) and recommencement with bleeding fingers, showing contradictory impulses of grief and resolve; embodied in chest loosening. Minor label phrasing like "stoically sparkling" slightly abstracts tears without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from box discovery to seven-day weave, culminating in Charged Poise RR ("message lifted... warmth depart") with legible cost in final shuttle pass through bead; orientation anchored early (orchard, bamboo by para 2).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bamboo whispers and orchard constrain isolation, worsening silence escalates pressure; oldest apple tree yields box that anchors weave, charging final glow image where orchard accepts her.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message to daughter) signaled early, tightens via puzzle edges/bead enabling impossible send; agency in recommencing weave forecloses self with on-page cost (essence given, bead dims), coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice-through-weave emerges organically from puzzle edges bridging time, silence knitting closed; final daughter awakening reweights premise without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer to distance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias on threads/patterns selective; rhythmic modulation builds to climax shimmer, purposeful compression taught early via "prayer sent into raveling silence."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (weaving repetition mirrors action); minor artifact in "stoically sparkling" reuse (tears/bead) borders label-loop but motifs constraint; closure image propels cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jigsaw edges as time-anchors and bead's exhausted sunlight transforms trope of maternal sacrifice; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens inevitability of latent cost.</comment>
