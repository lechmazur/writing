<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ellis's tinkerer traits drive consistent motivation from pattern recognition to preservation choice; embodied in toolkit improvisation and smile at final clock. Minor label-speak ("uncertainly certain") slightly abstracts interiority but doesn't undermine earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern-deepening from clocks to journal revelation; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "She left everything as she found it... smiled," reweighting premise with preservation cost legible in foreclosed solution path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Conservatory vines/ashes and cavern waterfall constrain choices (fountain pry, niche clocks) and charge final workshop image; sensory selection (spray rainbows, water-music) mirrors tinker's perceptual bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve 3:47 pattern) deepens accumulatively through discoveries narrowing to renunciation; agency in crowbar improvisation forces trade-off, with cost felt in "some mysteries demanded preservation, not solution."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of recursive mysteries emerges organically from clock pattern to journal insight; final compass placement offers non-literal resonance reweighting "better questions," embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with tinkerer perceptual signature (mechanisms as "compass needles"); rhythmic diction modulates from investigative to reflective, eliding backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "fingers blackening as she searched"); minor repetition ("uncertainly certain") purposeful but edges scaffold; rhythm propels without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock failures as temporal anomaly shrine transforms mystery trope; risk in solo discovery recursion heightens preservation stakes organically.</comment>
