<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority through precise micro-choices like borrowing seconds from heartbeats; embodied pendant sensations reveal motive and cost. Solo POV limits relational crucible but earns change via quest completion with time exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds via pattern discovery to CR closure: "the instant when sound learned it wasn't alone," with legible cost in pendant cooling and time outflow. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cages and Throat constrain uncaging choices; sensory sounds (crying, laughing) filter through illustrator bias and charge final freed-dance image. Purposeful details evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (echo origin) deepens via time bubble and uncaging under Accum lens; pendant heat/cold makes cost visceral, charging closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of completion emerges implicitly from uncaged laugh harmonizing "across was and will be"; final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature in "temporal music" and "pure mathematics of completion"; rhythm modulates tension purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel without loops; metaphors cohere (time as "honey, thin as wire") through peak uncaging beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-theft, sound-cages, giant's nap transforms echo trope; risk in temporal physics pays off inevitably at "echo...welcoming her home."</comment>
