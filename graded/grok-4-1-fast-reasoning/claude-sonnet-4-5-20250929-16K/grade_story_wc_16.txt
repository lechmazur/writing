<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in Maren's hesitation with the ink well and her deliberate sharing; final promise earned by prior causality including apology for silence's cruelty, with relational cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelation density builds from hesitation to collaborative sketching, landing Charged Poise closure ("Together," she promised) with cost of diverging paths reconfigured by shared method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ink well recurs to constrain choices (buying time, dipping pen) and charges final image as prism splitting light into possibility; archive's dust motes and sealed containers mirror silence-to-song arc without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust pre-divergence) signaled early, tightens via Kael's "Show me" forcing micro-choice; under accumulative lens, deepening reweights relational options with felt cost of past silence acknowledged on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of promises bridging silence/death emerges organically from method demo and hand-covering; final ink well/prism image resonantly reweights dead languages' revival without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Maren's perceptual bias on shadows/light) with distinct dialogue idioms (Kael's terse prompts vs. Maren's explanatory fervor); rhythmic control heightens pressure in sketching beat.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("frozen tear" to prism) taught early; no loops, clean propulsion, varied syntax supports accumulative build to sacred pen-dip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics as symphonies transforms academic trope via harmonic promises; risk-taking in conceptual closure (dead tongues sing) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
