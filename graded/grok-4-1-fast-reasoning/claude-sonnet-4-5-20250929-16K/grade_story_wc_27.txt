<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "awkwardly confident in her purpose even when that purpose felt like smoke," embodied via barefoot grounding and hum resonance, compelling her final decision to gather others with earned cost of self-doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory buildup from stones to stars culminates in CR closure ("She had found meaning in the mess: not an end, but a resonance") with legible cost in "prophet or fool"; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bare feet on "every crack and oil stain" and opera glasses constraining vision charge choices and final image; sensory details (hum in "chest cavity," purple shadows) selectively mirror internal shift without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in rebellion's mess) tightens via glasses-to-hum-to-stars progression under accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization in plan to reignite; cost felt in uncertainty charging poised ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pause-as-resonance emerges organically from particulars (stones waiting through civilizations, Navigator constellation); final image reweights "scattered fury" without moral, inviting ambiguity in her fool/prophet tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (spirals "move with the hum's rhythm," stars as "celestial mechanics"); rhythmic diction modulates from serene to thunderous, reflecting stargazer bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied syntax breathes with hum's intensification; no loops, purposeful metaphors ("ribcages of extinct animals") integrate without muddle in peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi ruins, ancient megaliths, and mystic resonance transforms rebellion trope via barefoot tactility and stellar alignment; risk in lyric closure heightens inevitability.</comment>
