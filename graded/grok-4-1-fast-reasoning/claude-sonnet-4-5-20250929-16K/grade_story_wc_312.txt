<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete timing of heartbeats and dew against brittle devotion; contradictory impulses peak in swinging despite "one failed experiment could shatter her resolve." Final endurance earned with visible cost of ongoing vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dripping rates builds to closure RR in "the sound... impossible—a tone that fell upward," reconfiguring cosmic balance with patient cost of "one drop at a time." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's dew patterns constrain timing choices and charge final upward-weeping image; selective sensory focus (cobalt glow, corroded bronze) mirrors internal stakes without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore imbalance) tightens via alignment wait to bell swing under accumulative lens, narrowing to "plausible impossibility" with cost in gradual dripping over flood. Agency in swing forecloses doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of weakness-as-strength emerges organically via lukewarm rebuild; final image "brittle devotion hardening into... faith" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dripping rhythms; diction modulates from patient buildup to impossible tone, rhythmic control heightens pressure at "Maren swung the bell."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition of "dripping rate" taught as pattern; varied syntax propels to closure image without loops or muddle, ear-test flows naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dew-clapper rebuild and upward-falling tone transforms magic tropes; risk in "vibration that moved through time" heightens cosmic stakes organically.</comment>
