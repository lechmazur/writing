<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation intensifies convincingly from commercial sterility to personal preservation after Kael's revelation, with embodied tears and hand-tracing showing contradictory impulses. Final commitment forecloses capital life with felt relational cost. Minor slip in "sudden clarity" epiphany borders on unearned but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as emotional density builds to Charged Poise/CR closure in final paragraph where Mira begins teaching Kael, reconfiguring alchemy with undeniable opportunity cost of her prior path. Orientation anchored early at ember nexus. One tightening via whisper revelation suffices; cost legible in "eyes close forever."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember nexus and drifting embers constrain choices via dying light mirroring Kael's sight loss, charging final "ember-glow" image. Sensory details (warm sparks, ash) filtered through Mira's alchemical bias integrate purposefully without stall. Twilight evolution heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal reconnection tightens accumulatively via whisper revelation, narrowing Mira's options to preserve Kael's sight; agency in gifting spheres forecloses commercial path. Cost felt in time-bound blindness and her return. Coherent pressure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of presence over commodity emerges via shifting pocket-sun meanings, culminating in non-literal resonant answer: "spiral inward and outward at once like the nautilus shell" reweights prior material. Subtext in silences and gestures avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with alchemist's perceptual signature (logarithmic spirals, light shades) and rhythmic modulation under emotional peak. Dialogue subtextual ("Differently," "losing the light") advances goals distinctly. Lyrical diction purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative layering ("density of presence," "scientifically romantic") purposeful without muddle in peak gifting beat. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy alchemy premise transformed via personal sight-preservation angle, with nautilus curl and palette spheres feeling inevitable. Quiet emotional risk heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
