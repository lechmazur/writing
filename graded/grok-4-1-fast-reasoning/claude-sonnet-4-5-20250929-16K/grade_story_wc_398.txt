<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marco's gentle persuasion and vineyard-rooted metaphors reveal character-specific traits under pressure, earning Elena's micro-choice to drop the letter; internal conflict in her hesitation feels embodied without diagnostic labels. Elena's contradictory impulses (Dimitri's practicality vs. shared history) act simultaneously in dialogue responses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dialogue density builds to Charged Poise closure as Elena drops the letter and notes the bus, reconfiguring options with felt relational cost (family feud, missed escape); single scene anchors orientation early, one tightening via Marco's grafting metaphor narrows paths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Amber pavilion's glow and rattling panels mirror suspended intimacy, constraining the private talk; vineyard evokes through Marco's sensory-tactile metaphors (pruning precision), filtering via his priorities without tourist catalog; autumn wind evolves to dance shadows at peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elena choosing mismatch over "practical" match) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via metaphor-deepening that forces her stance crystallization; agency in dropping letter forecloses Dimitri path with on-page opportunity cost, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of destined mismatches emerges implicitly from grafting parallels and family feud crucible, reweighting "should work" premise; final image of drifting paper and shared night offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, embracing feud's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third POV with perceptual bias (Marco's vine-inflected noticing); dialogue natural/subtextual ("terrible metaphor" reveals relief), distinct idioms (Marco's fervent precision vs. Elena's soft finishes); rhythm modulates to charged poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors integrated into action (lantern light on letter); varied syntax propels from setup to peak, no loops or filter stacks; minor mixed vehicle ("honey" glow to "bud break") in calm beat, not closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vineyard grafting transforms forbidden-love trope via specific sensory/professional lens (rootstock rejection); fresh synthesis of family feud as "tension to complexity" feels organic, not template; bold metaphorical risk heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
