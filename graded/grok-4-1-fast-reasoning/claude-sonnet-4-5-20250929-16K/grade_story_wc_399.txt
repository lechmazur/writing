<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—personal sacrifice via mask touch against communal need—act simultaneously in the consecration beat, earning her final choice with embodied cost. Prophet applies precise pressure without overshadowing. Internal voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dialogue stakes to pulsing harmonics, culminating in Charged Poise RR where Maya's awareness weaves into stone ("Part of me will have to remain here"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in final sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet constrains choices via boot-language and rises causally, charging closure image of "stone and flesh beginning their ancient conversation." Sensory integration (vibrations, murmurs) reflects line-walker bias without catalog. Evolving details mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echo) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via demonstration cadence to sacrifice deepening that forecloses personal wholeness. Agency in steps narrows options; cost felt in "my consciousness... part of the parapet's memory." Prophet forces crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of living memory amid fading emerges implicitly from patterns and sacrifice, reweighted in final image of "new clearing... alive in the spaces between footsteps" without moralizing. Particulars (parapet pulse, peripheral sense) drive resonance over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with line-walker perceptual signature ("language it spoke through the soles"). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You understand that consecration requires sacrifice"). Rhythmic prose modulates calmly to charged end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful figures like "dunes sang their lowest frequencies" integrate without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "final sequence of steps" without overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thinking desert (parapet grammar, conjured clearings) transforms sacrifice trope via peripheral mechanics. Risky lyric worldbuilding coheres organically, inevitable in hindsight at "gift encoded in the desert's bones."</comment>
