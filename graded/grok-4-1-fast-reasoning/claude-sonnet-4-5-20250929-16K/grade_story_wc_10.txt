<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to transform trauma into art is rooted in consistent traits like feeling vibrations without sound; contradictory impulses (rectify vs. transform) act in her choice to self-map over therapy. Final self-mapping choice earned by prior device calibration and Claire's test, foreclosing rectification with felt cost of enduring silence. Claire applies relational pressure via mouthed "perfect."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from backstory anchor to Claire's test tightening emotional mapping, culminating in on-page CR (self-mapping reconfigures loss as contentment's music) with conceptual cost legible in "some things couldn't be rectified, only transformed." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene fits defaults. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass panels and frost patterns constrain choices (tending plants in eternal chill mirrors silence's beauty), charging final image where refracted sun spectrum evokes unshaken marvels across plants. Sensory details (palm on cold glass, no fogged breath) filtered through deaf POV bias toward visual/mathematical precision. Micro-setting (workbench sensors) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, tightens via Claire's D minor score deepening to self-test, narrowing options under Accumulative lens with cadence shift to Charged Poise. Agency in positioning sensors and striking fork; cost felt in unrectified hearing but transformed endurance. Protagonist alteration charges closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over rectification emerges organically from heat-map test to self-application, with final image ("mapping her own face") offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting trauma's premise. Subtext in frost spirals/fern curls as unshaken marvels avoids moralizing; earned through particulars like tablet notation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (visual symphonies, mathematical frost); diction/rhythm modulates from descriptive calm to intensified closure ("began mapping her own face"). Minimal dialogue natural ("It's perfect" mouthed with heat-spike); no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task (e.g., "tablet bloomed... musical notation appeared" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful repetition (frost, marvels) taught early. Zero scaffold in peak beats like self-mapping.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes deafness/heat-mapping into fresh emotional-to-musical notation, transforming disability trope via specific device calibration and conservatory micro-world. Risky lyric closure (self as subject) heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from tuning fork talisman to contentment's score.</comment>
