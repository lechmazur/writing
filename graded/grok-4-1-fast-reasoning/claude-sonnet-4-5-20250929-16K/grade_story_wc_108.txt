<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya's embodied contradiction—trembling hands steadying as she embraces fear—earns her bluff at climax, revealing adaptive core over implanted phobias; Carson applies pressure via reveal, forcing her micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from seashell decode to library trap holds tightly under Causal lens; closure RR via flashlight beams and final whisper reconfigures her identity with emotional cost legible in starlit realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rust-scented air and oxidized shelves constrain staging (warped stairs, open roof); stars pool early and charge final gaze, mirroring transformation from enclosed fear to exposed truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-recovery escalates via Carson's arrival/hand to jacket, tightening to Maya's bluff narrowing his options; agency in her hesitation-forcing reveal drives Causal costs felt in his desperate face.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vulnerability-as-power emerges organically from phobia-adaptation and betrayal; final seashell/stars image reweights premise non-literally, though climax dialogue edges toward echo slightly dulling subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (phobia-tinged details); dialogue subtextual—Carson's "You're bluffing" hesitation advances goal pursuit with distinct idioms under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion varies with pressure, high density in confrontation; minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("skeletal orange fingers") doesn't obscure, but slightly elevates diction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Seashell halves and cast cipher transform identity-swap trope via stunt-phobia conditioning; outwit via breadcrumb trap feels inevitable from muscle-memory particulars, risking bold synthesis.</comment>
