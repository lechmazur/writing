<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority particular via embodied grief (face to glass, oxidized fingerprints); contradictory impulses in scientific persistence vs. colleagues' doubt act in notations; final satisfaction earned by data archive, foreclosing grief leave with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations density build to CR closure in final notation and telescope touch; cost legible in hummed emptiness as ongoing memorial; orientation anchored in opening gondola/height/Victor's fall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Telescope as micro-setting constrains observations and charges final touch; sensory selectivity (light spectrum, barometric hum) reflects POV urgency; gondola isolation mirrors internal voids without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove absences remember) signaled early, tightens via "gift" sky clarity forcing conviction; agency in measurements reweights knowledge under Accumulative lens; cost felt in supervisor doubt and solitude, charging presentation poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-in-absence emerges via gaps/notations, resonant CR in "homecoming" clouds reweighting premise without moral; subtext in Victor's "singing" transmission layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual bias (clouds as emotion); rhythmic modulation peaks in "wholeness spooled through air"; diction selective (patina, ghost-touch) sustains lyric texture to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short notations vs. lyric swells); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("thread through needles of light"); propulsion clear in observation beats to final hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological emotion + atmospheric memory transforms grief trope; risk in lyric CR pays off in "absence...wound tight," inevitable via data particulars.</comment>
