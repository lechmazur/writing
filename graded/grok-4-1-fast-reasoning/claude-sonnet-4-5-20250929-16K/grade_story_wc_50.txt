<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong single-POV interiority rooted in observant trait, with motivation intensifying through micro-choices like peripheral vision and rebuilding the timer; final renunciation of sharing feels earned via prior competence balanced by solitary endurance. Minimal overt internal contradiction slightly limits 9+ entry, but embodied progression and flaw-driven isolation (sealing the cavern) compel higher stakes authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: discoveries layer density to the symphony release as tightening, yielding CR closure when she seals the doors—"clicking shut with satisfying finality"—with conceptual cost of privatized wonder legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early (locksmith enters corroded cavern); no lens ambiguity or orientation debt. One meaningful deepening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern's gold veins and echoes constrain choices (light/sound angles dictate visits) and charge closure (harvested sounds preserved in stone); sensory hierarchy (sound over sight, peripheral drift) reflects POV bias vividly. Micro-setting via timer gears on velvet integrates tactilely. 9+ gate met via setting shaping tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking cavern's secret) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timed studies/rebuilding to agency-driven payoff; cost felt in winter isolation and foreclosed sharing path. Pivotal tightening at timer reconstruction narrows options under lens, charging final image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mystery/understanding as partners emerges organically from particulars (echo harvest, sealed wonder); final image ("hear those layered echoes... she'd smile at what she alone understood") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise via solitary cost. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual signature (peripheral noticing: "not looking directly at the walls"); rhythmic control modulates from observational calm to luminous release, no head-hopping or withholding. Diction biases toward locksmith's precision, enhancing immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid specifics ("brass gears splayed like... mechanical butterfly") advance multiple layers without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally, metaphors coherent/purposeful (e.g., "ice melting in reluctant spring"). Zero artifacts dull closure; read-aloud ear flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes locksmith trope with echo-harvesting cavern, transformed via peripheral observation and acoustic architecture; risk-taking in accumulative discovery arc feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically without gimmickry or derivatives.</comment>
