<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation in Mira's shift from silent observation to confrontation, earned by her prior paralysis admission; Viktor's contradictory conscience acts in scene via doodles. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "Transparency thaws mistrust" line slightly undercuts embodied peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds impeccably: stubs → eavesdropping → confrontation → charged poise closure with Viktor's resignation as felt cost. Single scene with spatial clarity; lens taught early and closure reconfigures options undeniably in final upstairs walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt and chimes integrate tactilely, mirroring evidence/fragments and charging final image; sensory selection (rainbows, tones, hush) biases through Mira's registrar lens. Recurrent tiles constrain thematic reflection without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of institutional mistrust tightens causally through Mira's discoveries forcing confrontation; agency in her "speak plainly" crystallizes stance with relational cost. One deepening suffices, but minor abstractness in ethical calculus prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honesty thawing mistrust emerges organically from doodles to transparent resolve; final chimes/tiles offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting ambiguity. Avoids moralizing, but "No more silence. No more ambiguity" edges toward direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in musical/transparent motifs; dialogue natural, subtextual (Viktor's "ambiguously clear"), advances plot. Rhythmic control modulates hush to deepening resonance without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful lyricism (e.g., "fractured rainbows") weaves into action. Minor overwriting in opening descriptors risks slight stall before stakes anchor, but no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of confession via doodles on tickets transforms theft trope into art/conscience angle; risk in cryptic method pays off at closure. Organic details like projector lens avoid template feel.</comment>
