<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. revelation in "Elena's academic training screamed hoax") act in scene; final renunciation earned by escalating confessions with embodied cost (tears freezing).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of revelations (Tom's call to mother's voice) culminates in CR closure ("No... learn how to metamorphose") with legible cost (foreclosed reporting path) and upward snow image reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underground garden constrains choices (planting yields arrowhead, playful gravity disorients) and charges closure via "between spaces" mirroring harmony; recurring bioluminescent moss and shifting tree filter through Elena's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (truth of harmony) signaled early, escalates via protagonist agency (answering phone) under accumulative lens to personal deepening (mother's call); cost unmistakable in foreclosed investigative path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (pain's metamorphosis) emerges organically from confessions and garden; final image ("snow began falling upward") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting bitterness as "cosmic jokes" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (academic skepticism degrading under stress); dialogue natural/subtextual ("What harmony?" advances goal); rhythmic control heightens phone-ring pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy rings amid lush sensory integration); no loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in mother's call without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid-as-transformer via phone confessions and upward snow; risk-taking (gravitational defiance) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
