<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via hollow chest pulling true names and embodied shift when crystals fill it painfully; contradictory grief/resolve acts in naming micro-choice; earned change peaks without unearned epiphany, closure choice compelled by prior loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via naming density building to Charged Poise closure; crystals forming from "Grief...Regret" mark legible before/after with painful solidity cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's cracked dome and dust motes constrain naming rite, charging crystals as final image; sensory hierarchy (light refraction over broad visuals) mirrors reaper's mapping bias; selective details evolve causally with light shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to crystallize hollowness tightens via daughter's voice echoing names, forcing stance reconfiguration; agency in blade/naming forecloses nameless drift with embodied cost; pressure coheres accumulatively to undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of naming fears to map loss emerges via monsters-to-crystals arc, reweighting premise in pocket of light-crystals; final image answers "nameless fears" non-literally without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (fears as sea beasts, echoes as prayers) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from hollow echo to crystallized cadence; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (light-blade refraction does triple atmospheric/advancement/symbolic duty); varied syntax propels from setup to peak crystallization without overwriting; closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh reaper-as-mapper synthesizing atlas horrors, phonograph echoes, light-crystals into inevitable transformation; risk in lyric naming rite heightens stakes organically; no derivative hedging, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
