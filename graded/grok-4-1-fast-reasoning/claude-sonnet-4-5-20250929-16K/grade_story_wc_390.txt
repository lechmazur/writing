<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—engineering calculations amid embodied grief—act simultaneously, earning her final harmonizing choice with Kael's freezing as visible relational cost. Internal conflict shown in "calculating stress loads while weeping," not summarized. Kael applies targeted pressure as surveyor foil, revealing her values through micro-choice of recorder and hum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discordant song → Kael emergence → confrontation → vibrational matching resolves into Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring ice as memorial with Kael's on-page freezing as cost ("stood frozen—literally now"). Single scene anchored early, no orientation debt. Closure cost legible in final design resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice floes constrain choice, singing "jagged" vibrations cataloged via Maren's palm press, charging final "requiem" image; key as micro-setting tool handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (frequencies felt in teeth/skull). Sunset evolves causally, mirroring shift from discord to harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent shattering) signaled early, tightens causally via Kael's "free it" proposal forcing trade-off; agency in "unhooking her field recorder" and hum forecloses destruction path. Escalation narrows options with resonant frequency calculations; cost in Kael's solidification and marina preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing memory vs erasure emerges via ice-song shift, answered non-literally in "requiem that honored...sorrow" as memorial. Subtext in Kael's enticement vs Maren's engineering ethic; final image reweights "sonic absolution" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as "stress loads," "tuning fork"); dialogue subtextual—Kael's "absolution worth the cost?" pursues goal, Maren's retort advances. Rhythmic control modulates intensity, diction matches engineer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "key hung...thrumming" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor figurative density in opening ice chorus risks slight overwatch but patterns toward climax payoff without muddling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sonic ice-memory premise synthesizes engineering + ethereal folklore freshly; risky "vibrational matching" turn inevitable from Faroe backstory, heightens stakes via irreplaceable key/ice logic without gimmick.</comment>
