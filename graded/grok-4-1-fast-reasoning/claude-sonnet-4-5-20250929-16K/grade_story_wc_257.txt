<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via embodied crafting ("fingers black with the ash," carving petals) reveals character under subtle pressure; arc from Vincent's loss to "subdued ardor" earned through micro-choices. Minor diagnostic reflection ("understood now") borders therapy-speak but anchors to present resin pour.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through crafting beats to CR closure in final starlit pendant image, reweighting grief-work with cost of "carrying forward" legible in "learning their language." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory dome opening lets "stars fell across her worktable," constraining craft and charging final platform image; tactile tools (diamond-tipped, resin) integrate purposefully. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (ash-resin "opalescent, like dawn through fog").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform daughter/mother grief via art) deepens accumulatively through stencil-to-pendant process, narrowing to personal endurance; cost felt in "death could become beauty without diminishing loss." Agency in precise carving seals turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-beauty emerges organically from ash-resin pour and blossoms "small resurrection"; final Pleiades-distorted image offers non-literal resonant answer to "withering to bloom," reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("stars wheeled through their ancient patterns"); rhythmic lyricism modulates with ardor, compression purposeful in origami folds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in "pressed the vellum stencil against warmed silver, watching the image transfer"; minor paraphrase loop in "teaching withering to bloom" repetition purposeful for pattern, not drag. Varied rhythm propels to starlit close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash-jewelry, origami comms, observatory stars transforms mourning tropes; risk in reflective accumulative drive heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
