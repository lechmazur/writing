<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mira's truthful compulsion amid social exhaustion, compelling her climb and revelation; final choice earned via prior beauty-noticing. Involuntarily truthful trait forces elaboration to old woman, revealing character under pressure without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: riddle solve deepens density to pollen CR, reweighting efficiency premise with conceptual cost in engineer's amazed eyes. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (tower toll post-blackout); one tightening via box opening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower micro-setting constrains climb to engineers, charging final pollen reveal; recurring honey/nectar dusk images mirror thematic wonder. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: geometric shadows, light in puddles reflect Mira's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drones' failure) signaled early tightens via riddle realization narrowing options to messy pollen; agency in reveal forecloses efficient code path with felt amazement cost. Escalation accumulates texturally to engineer's eyes moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection's miracle emerges organically from pollen/box vs drones, resonant non-literal answer in modified drones' "wandered" flights reweighting prior efficiency. No moralizing; ambiguity in wonder's persistence lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: Mira notices "geometric shadows," "light caught in puddles"; dialogue natural/subtextual (old woman's riddle indirection). Rhythm modulates to terse revelation spill.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "Her hands trembled as she opened the box" advances plot/emotion); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (honey/nectar without muddle). Rhythmic propulsion peaks in "truth spilled out like honey."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: truthful tollkeeper + pollen riddle transforms drone eco-failure into wonder-preservation fable; risk in riddle mechanics pays off inevitably at CR.</comment>
