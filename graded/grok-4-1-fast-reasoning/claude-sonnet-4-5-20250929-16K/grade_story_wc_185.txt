<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in bone-felt discord and ripple tattoos syncing with stone, compelling pitch adjustments that earn final exhaustion; contradictory competence-struggle acts in scene without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descent patterns build to ice-crack reading then bloom, landing Charged Poise closure ("quiet had been there all along") with exhaustion cost legible in final sitting image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ice cracks constrain humming choice and charge phosphorescent final image; sensory hierarchy (resonance over visual) filters through mapkeeper bias, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance) tightens accumulatively via crack-guided harmonics narrowing chaotic options; agency in conjuring forces trade-off, cost in "hammered repose" unmistakable at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of remembered quiet emerges via hush bloom reweighting energy chaos, final realization non-literal answer without moralizing; particulars like geode reprise avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonance-biased perceptual signature ("wave pattern fossilized") sustains third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in humming beat, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in bloom unfurling; no loops, coherent metaphors (frost across glass) enhance closure glow without overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh resonance-mapping premise synthesizes sci-fant organically, hush bloom turn inevitable from cave particulars; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
