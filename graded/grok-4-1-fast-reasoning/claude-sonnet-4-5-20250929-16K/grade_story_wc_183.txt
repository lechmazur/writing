<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to recapture understanding intensifies through embodied wandering and story-weaving under shifting memories; internal conflict in contradictory narratives acts in scene. Final step into garden earned by prior micro-choices like clutching the card and holding it to fog. Minor abstraction in "selfhood was negotiable" slightly distances peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog density and memory patterns build to CR closure—"She stepped forward... recapture meant release"—with conceptual cost of dissolved singular self legible in name-tags bearing her identity. Orientation anchored early (ship, fog, twins' legacy). Single scene, no shards, purposeful disorientation pays off at garden reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: "fog so thick it felt like breathing wool" and "carousel horses... painted eyes tracking" constrain wandering and charge final garden shift. Fog bank as micro-setting guides climax choice, mirroring internal fluidity. No white-room; evolves causally with tellings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture via narratives) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as "each telling... fog shifted," narrowing to card blaze and garden emergence. Agency in deliberate weaving forecloses trapped state with cost of self-dissolution. One tightening sufficient; cost unmistakable in card's fall and embrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of permeable identity emerges organically from twins' legacy, shifting stories, and garden payoff; final image—"every name-tag... bore her own identity"—reweights premise non-literally as release. No moralizing; ambiguity in "all versions... equally true" lingers with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable, perceptual signature in biased noticing ("emerald... define green itself"); rhythm modulates from drifting to charged climax. Voice texture distinct—"narrative threads... keys in locks"—fits surreal aims. No head-hopping; fog voices enhance without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; specifics like "copper tag" replace generics. Minor template cadence in consecutive "She told" sentences (−0.3), but purposeful for escalation; no loops obscure closure image of falling card.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chimera-inspired identity garden via card-key transforms surreal voyage trope organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes in memory fluidity; inevitable hindsight in "she had been the... discoverer. Now she was the discovered."</comment>
