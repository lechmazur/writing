<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in fossil-touching and floating as tethers to transformation; final endurance as voice earned via prior mapping choices. Minor slip: realization "not her real purpose anymore" borders diagnostic summary before micro-action payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup to CR closure; final floating image reconfigures her role with isolation cost legible in "suspended in salt and darkness." Orientation anchored early in cave/tide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>BiOLUM algae, saltwater pool, emotional residues constrain diving/recording and charge final float; sensory hierarchy POV-specific to mapper's priorities. Micro-setting (air pocket shelf) enables pivotal setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping to voicing unknown) deepens texturally from human residues to non-human patterns, narrowing to broadcast choice; felt cost in suspended isolation charges ending under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of planetary voice emerges organically from particulars like residues and fossil; final image non-literally answers abandonment-to-adaptation without moralizing, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with mapper's perceptual signature in tasting air, emotion wavelengths; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion without loops; varied rhythm in dive/surface beats accelerates to closure. Minor: "world becoming" motif risks paraphrase feel but pays off thematically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory tech mapping hibernating humanity's emotional wake into planetary consciousness; risk in "factually mystical" premise transforms post-apoc trope organically.</comment>
