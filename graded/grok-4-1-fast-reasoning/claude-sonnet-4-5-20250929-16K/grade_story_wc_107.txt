<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (melancholy/hope in "weighty lightness") act simultaneously during glassblowing, earning the endurance of continued creation; interiority is concrete and particular, revealed through theatrical narration and embodied reactions like steady breathing post-icicle crash. Flawless micro-choices under isolation pressure, like pinching the glass aperture, reveal values hierarchy with no safety-hedging. Backstory anchors tilt present stance without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup (studio in control room) through pattern of narration/reflection/action to CR closure in final sketching amid groaning pipes, reweighting loss as transformation with conceptual cost of impermanence legible in "Change looked like loss until you recognized it as transformation." Orientation anchors immediately (Mira in outpost studio); single scene coherent, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Environment (frost-rimed window, rusted panels) constrains choices (studio install) and charges final image (meltwater carving channels, mirroring internal thaw); sensory details selective via POV (artistic lens on "quiet violence of ice"). Micro-setting (blowpipe, annealer) integrates tactilely, evolving with action; no white-room, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crafting inquiry safe zones amid thawing isolation) signaled early, deepens texturally via icicle crash maintaining rhythm—forcing endurance trade-off that narrows to Charged Poise; cost felt in "weighty lightness" persisting to final smile/draw. Agency in micro-choices (rotation, pinching) tests commitment; one decisive intensification suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (thawing as survival via remembering/forgetting) emerges organically from glass spheres, ice cores, meltwater—final image offers non-literal resonant answer ("Mira smiled and kept drawing") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in bookmark passage and sculptures avoids platitudes; complexity lingers in ambiguity of researchers' flight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (artistic framing: "solitary theater"); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose syntax reflects contemplative mind (long reflective sentences breathe during calm, shorter post-crash). Theatrical self-narration feels natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, elision purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts: every line propels via multi-job sentences (e.g., "The molten glass glowed like captured sunlight" advances action/atmosphere/image); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax propels without monotony. No overwriting, filter stacks, or drift; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist-in-wasteland via glassblowing-as-thaw metaphor, transforming isolation trope through specific outpost details and "solitary theater" habit; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmick. No template echoes; voice/setting cohere authentically.</comment>
