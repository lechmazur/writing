<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies credibly from isolation to purpose via embodied cues like the warming bead and tree responses; ghost bride's traits feel particular through "silk and arsenic" voice. Internal conflict subtle but present in questioning the night. Final placement of bead earns change with felt cost of ongoing debt; minor abstractness in "emotion she couldn't name" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from flickers to solid speech, culminating in Charged Poise closure as Elara places bead amid endless night. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse under eternal dark. Cost legible in "debt repaid, lifetime by lifetime" and purposeful solitude; no orientation debt, lens clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via endless night enabling cross-world reach and charged fruits mirroring internal awakening; "silver apples that sang" filters through Elara's tending. Evolves subtly with responsive trees; greenhouse heart anchors closure image of bead placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchard tending in darkness tightens accumulatively through bride's appearances to revelation of awakenings; agency in following guidance forecloses isolation with cost of perpetual night. One deepening via midnight inscription suffices; cost unmistakable in "until the debt is repaid."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal awakening emerges organically from fruits as soul-keys and debt-repayment; subtext in bride's forgotten name vs. remembered love. Final "mournful elation" image reweights solitude as haunted purpose without moralizing, resonant under textural lens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in impossible fruits and whispers; voice modulates poetically yet precisely, e.g., "lovingly venomous." Dialogue subtext-rich, advances revelation; no head-hopping, diction biased to alchemical wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "plums that wept mercury"; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (e.g., "cathedral of glass") without muddle in peak dialogue beat; propulsion peaks at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost mentorship in alchemical night-greenhouse transforms inheritance trope; "resonant awakenings" via fruits offers non-obvious premise. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure's bittersweet taste image; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
