<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's blind spot as clairvoyant drives inevitable awakening of forces, with contradictory impulses (celebrate pilgrim's rapture amid encroaching shadows) acting in scene; final earned smile at surprise forecloses predictive certainty with felt cost of genuine unknowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pearl's light accumulates shadows into aware presence; on-page CR in "the cave sang a new song" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of evolved magic, orientation anchored early in cave's song and pilgrim's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Musical crystal cave as micro-setting constrains via acoustics and shadows' creep, charging final image; "cathedral of bright darkness" integrates sensory bias (Vera notices prisms, hums) with evolving pressures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of amplifying magic tightens accumulatively as shadows feed on pearl's light then enrich cave's song, forcing Vera's admission; cost legible in "confession felt like falling," charging poise at surprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unintended magic evolution emerges organically from pearl-shadow interplay; final "terrifying gift of genuine surprise" offers non-literal resonant reweighting of magnification's irony without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in Vera's wonder-filtered noticing (shadows as "dark watercolors"); sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("I don't know"); rhythmic control heightens under pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated sensory propulsion; no loops, coherent metaphors like "shadows pooled... thick as spilled ink" serve without muddling peak shadow-rise beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cave as self-aware through accumulated enchantment transforms wonder tropes; risk in steadily unpredictable shadows heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Vera's practices.</comment>
