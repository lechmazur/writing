<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in Della's mercy choice after Kern's confession, earned by causal plan and embodied via watch fob; flaws (revenge drive) complicate without hedging; voices distinct in dialogue cadence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: false leads → dawn reveal → confession DC → mercy RR with cost ("truces... mercy"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rotting pier market constrains via shadows/proximity and charges closure (sunrise fingers); sensory selective (salt-thick dark, oil lamps); watch fob as micro-setting recharges end image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (traitor ID) tightens causally at confession narrowing revenge option; agency in plan/confrontation/renunciation with relational cost legible in final exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (hush as mercy) emerges via confession/choice without statement; watch fob reprise reweights "time vs. word"; resonant CR in realization charges prior plan.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (watch fob warmth); dialogue subtextual/goal-driven (Kern's cadence comforts, indirection reveals); rhythmic diction modulates pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density/propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts; purposeful figuration ("curdled," "fog") in peak without muddle; closure image crisp.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh false-leads/recording revenge twist on pirate hush economy; mercy reconfiguration risks quiet stasis; transforms tropes via audio/sound motif.</comment>
