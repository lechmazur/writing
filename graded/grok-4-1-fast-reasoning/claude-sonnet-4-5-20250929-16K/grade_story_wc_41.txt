<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Marcus's precognitive forgetfulness creates contradictory impulses—forgetting the goal yet following markers—that compel the renunciation at closure; Sarah's role as memory-bearer forces relational endurance with felt cost. Final hand-shake and chalk refusal earned by prior markers and shared hearing. No diagnostic labels; embodied in chalk tremble and driftwood path.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fog, markers, chalk builds to hearing the hum, reconfiguring as Charged Poise RR—refusal to capture with legible cost in "capturing it meant killing it." Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph; closure image (line on arch) reweights forgetting/recording premise.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fog sculpture garden constrains path and hearing via thickening mist and corroded forms; driftwood markers and final arch charge closure image. Sensory hierarchy (fog curl, rust touch, low hum) POV-filtered through Marcus's prophetic listening. Micro-setting (chalk on steel) mirrors internal surrender.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (capture aging's sound) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via markers to hearing then renunciation, narrowing options with agency in chalk refusal. Cost unmistakable in hand-shake realization and Sarah's proxy mark; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of echoes/memory emerges via particulars (videotapes, hum, line-drawing); final image resonant non-literal answer—reminder over capture—reweights prophecy without moralizing. Subtext in Sarah's "time moving wrong," complexity in mutual clinging avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (fog alive, cells whispering); dialogue subtextual ("You're listening again") pursues goals, distinct idioms (Marcus poetic, Sarah direct). Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at "some sounds could only exist in the listening." No head-hopping; elision of exact "what" paid off on-page.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm (short hum-sentence peaks); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—fog/driftwood consistent. Minor figurative density in opening ("film dissolve") purposeful for textural lens, not overwriting; closure line crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes forgetfulness, sound-capture, fog-prophecy into inevitable refusal; "sound of growing older" fresh angle transforms aging trope. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via markers paying off in arch-hum; no derivatives, fully committed.</comment>
