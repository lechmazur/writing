<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to graft compassion from her father's destructive legacy drives consistent traits and micro-choices like giving the coin and guiding grafting, with embodied emotion in her steady hands; internal conflict emerges in refusing forgiveness for fierce compassion. Marcus applies relevant pressure as scarred child echoing her past. Minor therapy-speak in "scars can sing" slightly abstracts peak realization without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from sand ritual to grafting and Marcus's smile, delivering Charged Poise closure in final paragraph where Maya's certainty deepens, reconfiguring legacy with conceptual cost of unyielding transformation. Single scene oriented immediately at lagoon edge. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcanic sand and lagoon constrain choices (spreading for ritual, pouching for home) and charge final image of fertile darkness; sensory details like "grains catching light like tiny fragment of night" filter through Maya's priorities. Atmosphere mirrors transformation without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clear in grove work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving scars sing tightens accumulatively via Marcus's question and pain admission, forcing Maya's grafting response that narrows to relational cost in "pain and the love." Agency in her guidance yields smile as cadence shift. One deepening sufficient; cost legible in endured legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grafting beauty from scars emerges organically through sand, plants, coins; final image of Marcus's smile reweights father's fires as "fertile ground" without moralizing. Subtext in coin's dual hold of pain/love invites ambiguity. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in transformation metaphors; dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Marcus's whisper reveals guarded pain). Rhythm modulates calmly then charges at smile. Minor filter in reflective backstory but anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying from lyrical openings to clipped dialogue; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "rippled landscapes of third-degree burns" risks coherence in opener but doesn't touch closure. Propulsion clear through action integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson legacy into coin-grafting therapy transforms redemption trope via volcanic specificity and scarred child's smile. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; hinges on irreplaceable particulars like obsidian soil.</comment>
