<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spirited sculptor's perpetual learning trait drives concrete micro-choices like interpreting the archway and rejecting GPS, earning the shift to collaborative art with embodied cost in foreclosed mastery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as slide layers deepen knowledge to CR closure; legible cost in "didn't restart her GPS" reconfigures navigation with conceptual price of intimacy over mapping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and spiral beach constrain discoveries and final placement; driftwood handling as micro-setting charges image, filtered through sculptor's tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of artistic breakthrough deepens via slide revelations under accumulative lens, narrowing to land-based tactics; final sculpture start bears cost of dynamic impermanence over static control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of simplicity scaffolding complexity emerges organically from slide layers to final image of storm-reimagined sculpture, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sculptural perceptual signature ("simple curve could redirect impossible weight") biases noticing consistently; rhythmic modulation from storm tension to reverie sustains single-POV poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels revelations; purposeful metaphors like "turbine-hum" avoid muddle, zero loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magic slide predicting self transforms artifact trope into timewoven CR; bold accumulative layering risks conceptual payoff, synthesizing art/landscape intimacy freshly.</comment>
