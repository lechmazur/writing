<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Meridian's weariness embodied in "slow from decades of laying the drowned to rest" anchors motivation; flaw of past stubbornness drives pivotal realization and transformation into keeper with eternal cost. Internal conflict emerges through failed returns of souls, compelling higher-stakes actions. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing ("She had been inadvertently stubborn") borders telling but ties to concrete lens cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: package arrival seeds signals' density increase, fragment placements deepen patterns, assembly at impossible center yields RR closure as library transforms into soul harbors. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Meridian, underwater library, package). Cost legible in her threshold occupancy and faded signals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impossible library spaces constrain choices ("thinnest" for fragments) and charge final image (four-place room stretches body, becomes rest chambers). Sensory details (phosphorescent light bending signals, flooded corridors) filter via undertaker bias, evolve causally. Micro-setting (lens facets catching dimensions) mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proper soul rest) signaled early, tightens via clarifying signals into transformation; agency in placements forecloses past methods with her eternal role as cost. Accumulative escalation via layering signals coheres pressure. Inciting package tests commitment without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of rest as deep architecture emerges organically from lens signals to pocket chambers; final image reconfigures "chased stillness" into created shelter without moralizing. Subtext in souls' "permanent address" invites ambiguity on her sacrifice. Minor directness in "Peace was not a destination but an architecture" slightly undercuts resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (signals as "desperate morse"); voice modulates rhythm for intensity (short sentences in four-place entry). Experimental spatial slippage taught early via library, legible at stretched-body closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (fragments "fit together differently"); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("tired ghost," "cascading light") purposeful for tone, no muddle in peak assembly. Clean grammar, strong verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker mythos with spatial library magic and soul lighthouse; impossible geometries transform tropes organically. Risky premise implications fully committed (body stretched across dimensions heightens closure stakes). No derivatives, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
