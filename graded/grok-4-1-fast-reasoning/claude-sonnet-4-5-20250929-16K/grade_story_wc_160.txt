<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena's ingenuity shines in concrete micro-choices like mixing ash paste to reveal the message, rooting motivation in training and traits. Minimal internal contradiction limits depth—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously before the valve turn. Competent without deep flaws, but actions align tightly with harmonizing stake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: envelope analysis therefore chain retrieval therefore valve discovery and turn as DC/RR closure with three-day restoration cost legible on page. One tightening at hidden valve suffices; orientation anchored by ~80 words in amphitheater arrival. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Volcanic "breathing" stone constrains timing via thermal expansion, charging final harmony image; ash paste integrates sensory detail (warmth, dust) through goal-directed action. POV bias filters via machinist's eye on infrastructure. Recurring contraction/expansion mirrors equilibrium without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize villages) signaled early tightens causally at valve discovery, narrowing from zero-sum to balanced flow with visible effort cost. Agency in analysis/measuring drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. Elders' demonstration crystallizes stance reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion emerges organically from adhesive message and builder's valve, reweighting conflict in final communal image without statement. Particulars like chain thirds avoid platitudes; ambiguity in villages' prior distrust lingers plausibly. No moralizing or echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (machinist notices mechanisms, thermal shifts); voice modulates poetically yet controlled. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven (elder surrenders chain). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "water flowed... system shudder and settle"); rhythm varies with scene breath. Minor recurrence of "dappled"/shadows purposeful, no loops or muddled metaphors. Clean propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcano-amphitheater floodgates with glue-imprint encryption transforms engineering puzzle into compassion metaphor organically. Risky thermal "breathing" motif heightens stakes via time pressure without gimmick. Fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
