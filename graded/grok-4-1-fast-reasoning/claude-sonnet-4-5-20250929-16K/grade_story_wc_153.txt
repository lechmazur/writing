<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in memory shard ("fury rising... desperate hope in her eyes"), revealing blind spots and earning choice; medium applies crucible pressure without stock safety-hedging. Minor slip: medium's layered voice verges archetypal in "space where an apology waits unspoken."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: revelations densify (shard, letters, memory) to RR closure ("moment before deciding never truly passes") with emotional cost legible in clutched letters/shard and path forward. Orientation anchored early (mangroves, moonlight by para 2); single scene with taught memory shard fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mangroves constrain navigation ("by their voices"), moonlight charges shard/recurrent object in closure image; sensory hierarchy (auditory spirits, visual silver water) mirrors urgency, integrated via action (spreading letters on window).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology moment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via evoked memory tightening (sees sister's hope, foreclosing prior fury path) to agency in running "toward reconciliation" with felt cost of silence. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (unspoken moments persist) emerges organically from letters/shard interplay, resonant CR in "apology... speaking itself through you" reweighting silence without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "waiting to be chosen again."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (spirits "wrapping around ribs"); voice modulates rhythmically ("sang their endless harmonies") under pressure, dialogue subtextual ("You seek the moment before deciding") distinct from Isla's whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., short crescendoed spirits vs. layered descriptions); figurative language purposeful (roots "twisted like frozen thoughts") without muddle in peak memory beat. Minor density slip in opening metaphors, but closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove mysticism, gargoyle shard, dual unsent letters transforms reconciliation trope; risk in lyric memory shard pays off inevitably at "fierce tenderness that had survived everything."</comment>
