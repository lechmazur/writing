<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to excavate truth clashes with her realization that it endangers hope, earning her final renunciation through embodied contradiction; "Some truths, she realized, were better left buried" shows internal conflict acting in the burning scene without tidy resolution. Vera applies targeted pressure via quiet exposition, distinguishing voices idiomatically. Blind spots in assuming comfortable lies drive her competent-yet-flawed arc to Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: observation → intuiting documents → reassembly → revelation → DC in burning papers, foreclosing her mission with legible cost in the final image of thriving trees. Single scene adheres to defaults; orientation anchors by para 2 (wasteland, orchard, debunker role). Closure decisively reconfigures stakes, no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard constrains choice (protect vs. destroy) and charges closure image of "thriving apple trees"; dust storms part around it, integrated via Maya's gaze in opening para. Sensory hierarchy (rust-colored dust vs. green anomaly) reflects POV urgency; no white-room, coherent choreography in cottage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debunk curse vs. preserve stillpoint) signaled early, tightens causally via memo revelation narrowing options to destroy-or-protect; agency in burning docs pays visible cost (hope's fragility foreclosed). Escalation driven by her choices under causal lens; moral calculus peaks in "what did you do when the comfortable lie protected...hope?"</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of chosen sacrifices vs. random curses emerges organically from reassembly mosaic and burning act, resonating in final line's Conceptual Repricing without statement. Returning orchard image shifts from anomaly to deliberate cost; subtext in Vera's tea moment invites ambiguity on truth's value.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (cataloging details like "absence of radiation burns"); dialogue subtextual (Vera's "You understand now" pursues revelation goal). Voice texture distinct in syntax variety, modulating to charged poise at end; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., reassembly advances plot, reveals world rules); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts in peak beats. Clean grammar, strong verbs; final para opening anchors resolution image purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms curse trope into deliberate stillpoint sacrifice, grown from document particulars; risk in quiet anti-debunker closure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Non-obvious moral calculus (bury truth to save hope) inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
