<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—furious love vs. dampener-severed revenge—act simultaneously until the scrimshaw grip loosens her guarded heart, earning the release with embodied cost in the chest-shift moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (kelp, whale shadow) builds to Resonant Reconfiguration closure: scrimshaw release reweights her self-story with felt cost of the false protector sinking like the island.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Island's tidal emergence constrains her wading choice and charges final tidal-pool touching; sensory hierarchy (barnacled rocks via feet) filters through dock-worker grace without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (detach hardened self) signaled early tightens via whale-call deepening, forcing renunciation agency; release forecloses vengeance path with on-page cost of unspent gentleness unlocked.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tender strength over violence emerges implicitly from dampeners, scrimshaw, whale; final "touching each living thing softly" recharges prior fury-love tension non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (grace on rocks, whale vibration through feet) with rhythmic control; diction modulates intensity purposefully, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "kelp sliding against her calves") propels with varied rhythm; no loops, purposeful metaphors (anemones like fists) cohere without muddle at peak whale call.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh post-Treaty dampener world synthesizes pirate scrimshaw/whale into combative tenderness arc; lyric risk-taking (tidal imagery cadence) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
