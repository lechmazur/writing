<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as patient preserver is concrete and intensifies through decoding, with embodied patience in snow accumulation and stiff rising; micro-choices like tracing strands reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via knot sequences to fulgurite integration and method realization; orientation anchors immediately in dock/harbor/snow. Closure as CR in "I can help" whisper and commitment, with patient-sharing cost legible in final knot warning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via rope tactility, harbor lapping, fog sphere constraining focus; recurring hush and snow mirror internal trust. Golden dock and fulgurite charge final image of carried wisdom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding preservation tightens accumulatively through knot revelations narrowing to fulgurite method; agency in patient examination forecloses exploitation path. Cost felt in sterile chamomile refusal and devotion decades-scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encoded patient preservation emerges via knots-to-glass awakening, fish patterns parallel in final image reweighting wisdom's continuity without statement. Resonant CR answers preservation question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in knot-as-manuscript noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to flooding understanding. Diction like "manuscript...word" reflects philosophical collector bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Three overhand knots...blood knot" advances plot/prose); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative "lightning made glass...seeds remember."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knot-codes, fulgurite-seed revival transforms preservation trope organically; risk in solo-epiphany scene heightens quiet stakes, inevitable in hindsight via rope sequences.</comment>
