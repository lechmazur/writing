<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in ignorance cartography intensifies compellingly through micro-choices like pausing before Future Three; embodied precision in quill handling reveals traits under task pressure. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak writing beats, leaning descriptive over dramatic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via three futures tightening to thermal innovation; Charged Poise closure in "future now suspended between the written page and the choices yet to come" with legible conceptual cost of Council's unseen decision. Orientation anchored early in spire climb; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain choices—spire as writing site and volcanic clue charges thermal future and final image of "earth held warmth" beneath lake. Sensory selection (frigid breath, gray light) reflects cartographer's grounded bias; details evolve causally from night to dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (predict viable futures under constraints) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening from safe Fortress to risky Extraction to unmapped Thermal Tapestry narrowing options. Agency in her modeling forecloses desperation paths; visible costs (innovation death, collapse) charge recommendations and final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mapping ignorance for sustaining transformation emerges organically from lattice-building and futures; final image of quill cleaned against endless lake reconfigures premise with resonant ambiguity of "willingness to see beyond." No moralizing; complexity in viable paths lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in cartographer's precise noticing (quill barbs, obsidian ink); rhythmic control modulates from reverent unpacking to quick writing under dawn light. Prose texture distinct, biased toward terra incognita details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "quill felt alive... dipped into ink mixed with powdered obsidian"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (spire as "blackened tooth") without muddle in peak writing beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ignorance cartography and probability lattices synthesize fresh premise of predictive writing; third future's thermal vents from spire evidence transforms colony trope into grounded ingenuity. Risk in unmapped possibility heightens stakes organically.</comment>
