<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under time pressure, like peeling paint despite frustration; earns refusal at throne with prior causal build. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from flake inertness to warming during peeling ("ruby flake grew warmer"), yielding Charged Poise closure as throne activates but remains unclaimed ("didn't sit"), with legible cost in refusal and met sunrise deadline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Painted walls constrain pivotal choice (peeling reveals mural guiding stairs); recurring flake and bioluminescent stairs charge final throne image. Sensory selectivity (singing waterfall frequencies, circuit-bark) filters through lore-keeper bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant discovery stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via paint revelation narrowing path to stairs; agency in tracing mural forces trade-off refusal with visible cost ("throne would remain unclaimed a while longer"). Minor abstractness in stakes vs. visceral opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom over power emerges organically from particulars like paint layers (eras bridged) and refusal; final image ("weight of possibility and lightness of hope—futuristic and ancient") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing circuit-patterns, inscriptions); rhythmic prose modulates from adventurous ("wisely adventurous steps") to poignant tears, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., layered peeling advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("compressed starlight") in peak but purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human ruins (pixel-waterfall orchard, paint-mural gateway) transformed via refusal twist; peeling method risks bold ingenuity heightening stakes organically.</comment>
