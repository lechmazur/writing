<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in reflection on daughter (preserve) vs. self (destroy), acting simultaneously before "Both had been wrong" earns final "Yes" with life's reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from kite snag to plant-guided decoding to amber shattering; Charged Poise closure ("Yes" amid pulsing light, new shoots) reconfigures options with conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Steam-veiled cave constrains unsealing access while plants' sensory cues guide decoding; volcanic soil yields new shoots in closure image, charging environment with purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (unseal destiny seed) signaled via kite script, deepens through plants' "eager and afraid" before her cracking voice enacts climax; agency forecloses destruction path with tradition-evolution cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tradition-vs-change tension emerges organically through kite/temple link and embryo's intent; final "gardening futures" image reweights premise non-literally, embracing synthesis without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature via plant sensations ("screamed and sang") biases noticing distinctively; rhythmic modulation peaks incantatory in unsealing words, holding POV stability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels from "snagged on dead branches" to "amber shattered" without loops; varied rhythm breathes in reflective beats, accelerates climax cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plant-telepathic insurgent decoding bark-script kite to engineered embryo synthesizes post-war sci-fi mysticism boldly; closure's root-network link feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
