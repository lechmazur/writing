<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in rational warnings ignored for "fierce joy," earning final stance; embodied scars and geode press reveal grief-rooted drive without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise/CR closure; "geode pulsed warmth" image legibly reconfigures reality with conceptual devastation cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating observatory's breakers and gyros constrain power choices, geode as micro-setting charges final pulse; desert ruins mirror internal wounds through dust storms viewed early.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release pooled potential) tightens via growing concentration and calculations under Accumulative lens; agency in geode focus forecloses safety with "probably devastating" cost felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "world would feel what she'd felt" image non-literally reweights violence's severance without moralizing; theme emerges organically from geode-amplified echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (reading "world's wounds"); diction like "quantum-locked" reflects scientific-grieving mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, no loops; minor explanatory density slips mid-story but not in peak "coalesce" closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perturbation theory synthesizing quantum grief into "unused potential pooling" feels inevitable; bold premise transforms drone strike into spacetime dam-break.</comment>
