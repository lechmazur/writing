<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied claustrophobia ("fighting the familiar constriction," "throat close and vision narrow") creates contradictory impulses that act in scene, earning final endurance of repeated descents with visible cost in terror and tide.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of anomalies and phase shifts to Charged Poise closure; codex glow and vow to return reconfigure erasure premise with cost legible in "emerged as the sea crashed back" and resolve despite fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Facility's breathing via phase transitions ("pools...starting to freeze," "water seeping under the door") constrains descent choices and charges final emergence image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of retrieving proof tightens accumulatively via anomalies and early tide, forcing download; endurance agency forecloses safety with on-page cost in claustrophobic pressure and submersion threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final codex glow offers non-literal answer to witnessing unremembered, reweighting descent loyalty through particulars of signals and erasure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in tracking "electromagnetic whispers" and pulsing gold; rhythm compresses under stress without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensation, anomaly in propulsive rhythm; "crashing hush" motif varies without loop, building to closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of medieval codex mapping cable signals transforms deep-sea trope; risk of solo descent heightens stakes organically to inevitable close.</comment>
