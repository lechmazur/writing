<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation rooted in brother's loss drives methodical choices to completion; embodied sensations like thread drawing heat from fingers reveal character under pressure. Notebook phrases introduce minor unearned foreignness, but don't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from weaving to thread singing and illusions folding; closure RR via shared reality pocket legible with conceptual cost in "suspended in unsettling calm." Orientation anchored early in Escher Wing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery's impossible geometries and changing illusions (Penrose shadow of brother) constrain sightline mapping and charge final folding; tactile vibrations through bone integrate purposefully. Micro-setting of thread and panels mirrors internal quest vividly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture connection tightens via pattern snap and eruption, narrowing to surrender; agency in final tie-off forces trade-off with phantom resistance felt on-page. Cost legible in passing-through fingers catching texture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of built connection emerges from weaving particulars, reweighting illusions as truer than truth in final image without statement; brother's harmonics layer ambiguity meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward geometries and vibrations; distinct diction (sinew thread, rational enchantments) modulates rhythm under rising subsonic hum. Brother's dialogue carries layered subtext advancing recognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from calm weaving to eruptive climax; purposeful metaphors like "texture of connection itself" avoid muddle. Minor repetition of "realistically imaginary" motif supports textural lens without loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sinew in Escher gallery transforms schizophrenia loss into rational-summoned presence; risk in boundary-dissolving closure heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from mapped sightlines.</comment>
