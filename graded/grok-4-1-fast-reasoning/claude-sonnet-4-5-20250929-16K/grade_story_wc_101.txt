<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's gently persistent trait drives micro-choices like repeated runs and 13 rings, earning the final step-back with embodied heart-hammering cost. Secondary characters like Petrov and Sasha apply targeted pressure, revealing generational rift. Minor slip: internal conflict more summarized in reflection than simultaneous impulses in the speech beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: anonymous acts densify to pattern break at 13 rings after departure announcement, yielding RR closure in communal unpacking with felt dispersal cost. Orientation anchored early (Mira, ridge/arbor, sanctions). One tightening sufficient; two-shard past-to-present fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor and bell constrain gathering choice and charge final swaying image, with moonlight/breath clouds mirroring unity. Sensory hierarchy selective (tactile tarnish, clear note) through Mira's priorities. 9+ gate met via recurring arbor/bell shaping tactics and close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt dispersal) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via runs to departure/rings, forcing declaration agency. Cost legible in "amplified quiet" and young defiance. Single deepening coheres under lens; enters 8+ via live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of uncredited care emerges organically from packages/bell runs to shared sorting, final image resonating without moral. Mira's speech ("stronger together") borders Thematic Echo, pulling from peak clarity (−0.4). Counter-reading in young tiredness adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias (bell as "silver thread"); dialogue natural/subtextual (Sasha's "Why didn't you?"). Rhythmic modulation in quiet-to-unpacking shift. Distinct voices: Petrov's creased understanding vs. Sasha's direct youth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punchy rings vs. flowing reflection); density high, no loops though "gently persistent" echoes twice without churn. Minor scaffold in adjacent reflection sentences on restlessness (−0.2). Propulsion clear to unpacking close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sanctions-exile via anonymous bell-runs transforms community trope into intergenerational tactic. Risk in open unity sans tidy win heightens stakes. No derivative guardrail; bell/premise particular.</comment>
