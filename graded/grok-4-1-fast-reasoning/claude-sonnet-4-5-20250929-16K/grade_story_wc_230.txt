<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied precision ("boots finding purchase") and contradictory impulses (rational risk cataloging yields to desperate act), earning final private endurance; minor diagnostic phrasing ("rational mind") doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via density build from find to activation, landing Charged Poise closure ("door closing softly") with legible conceptual cost in "fractured kind of grace"; orientation anchored early, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains choices (rope bridges sway, storm forces cabin retreat) and charges final image (orchard sways "resilient and storm-scarred," mirroring Mara); sensory hierarchy reflects forager's tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (privacy) tightens accumulatively via neighbor recall and relic interface, forcing agency in eye-use with felt cost ("fractured... rebuilding"); minor abstractness in virus summary doesn't dull peak test on bridge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of privacy's "fractured grace" emerges organically from particulars (confession fractures neighbor, eye rebuilds self), resonating non-literally in final descent without moralizing; counter-readings (beauty in vulnerability) add complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third with perceptual signature (methodical precision in noticing roots, gold flecks); rhythmic control modulates from calm foraging to charged activation; no head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "pressed the cool glass" layers action/image/cost); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; "fractured" recurrence purposeful, charging closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy dystopia with hanging orchard micro-world transforms tropes via specific relic logic and "door" occlusion; risk-taking in quiet CR closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
