<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marisol's embodied grief (gripping compass, unshed tears) and contradictory impulses (wanting apology but turning away) earn forgiveness choice; Takeshi's pressure via lace forces micro-revelation pivotal to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens deepens remembrance density to CR closure; compass steadying on "cerulean morning" and glowing finale image mutual fault cost legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Post-rain islet (mist-clung stones, salt-new beginnings smell) mirrors grief-to-acceptance; compass/lace as micro-settings constrain realization and charge glowing horizon image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grief stake signaled early tightens via lace to mutual silence trade-off; forgiveness agency forecloses resentment path with whispered apology cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lace pattern and cerulean blue offer non-literal answer to silence-as-severance without moralizing; reweights family navigation premise through concrete images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with sea-remembrance perceptual bias; Takeshi's honey-slow dialogue subtextually advances revelation, distinct from Marisol's catching voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels to "compass needle glowed softly"; minor opener figurative density ("tides of remembrance don't follow logic") purposeful without peak muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lace-navigation and emotion-color compass transform ghost ship trope; cerulean regret synthesis inevitable from particulars, risking lyric closure payoff.</comment>
