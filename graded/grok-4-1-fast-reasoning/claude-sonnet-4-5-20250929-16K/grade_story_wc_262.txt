<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to find unused love intensifies through psychometry visions into compelled release; embodied sensations like "vibrating between frames" reveal particular interiority. Minor weakness: lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously before climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from individual strips to "spread every film strip across the booth's floor"; on-page RR closure in threading projector delivers conceptual cost of emotional release, legible in "wept and smiled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projection booth's "hot metal and old celluloid" anchors sensory immersion, constraining climax via "ancient projector"; final image of "images splashed across the screen" charged by setting evolution from dust to light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of locating unused love escalates accumulatively to 47th-night overload, narrowing to release action; agency and felt emotional cost clear in "hushed thunder... shaking her at frequencies below sound."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of incubated love emerges organically from strip visions to projector release; resonant non-literal closure in "turning silence into light" reweights particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature via psychometry ("phantom weight of every emotion") biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, consistent diction under climax stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, varying sentences propel to climax; minor deduction for figurative pile-up in peak ("hushed thunder... struck tuning fork... breathing room between one frame"), risking slight opacity without coherence loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry on film gaps for "unused love" transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure stakes, inevitable in "each frame a word, each reel a sentence."</comment>
