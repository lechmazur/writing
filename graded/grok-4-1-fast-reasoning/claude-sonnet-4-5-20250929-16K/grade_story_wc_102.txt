<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation rooted in past life memory compels her micro-choices like persisting with breathing; woman's grief embodied in panic pattern forces relational crucible. Internal curiosity shows contradiction between artist/healer identities acting simultaneously. Minor therapy-speak ("grief lodged") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/shadow images builds to CR closure in crystal adjustment where unused love releases into present ("It's not gone... See?"), reweighting premise with felt cost of ongoing pilgrimage. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (viaduct, memory). Single scene causality tight without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viaduct wisteria and twilight constrain choices (pedestrian path for box) and charge final image (blooming eternal mirroring chest light). Sensory hierarchy via artist's eye (violet waves, pink/gold sky) filters urgently. Micro-setting crystal/tear evolves tactilely, warm at close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unused love's location) signaled in opening memory, tightens accumulatively via knot dissolving in obscura to force Marina's stance crystallization. Breathing guidance shows agency narrowing options (failing gasps to steady release). Cost legible in woman's tears and Marina's partial answer ("part of her answer").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unused love's bodily storage emerges via knot-to-pollen shift, not statement; final image (light drifting up) offers non-literal answer reweighting question without moral. Subtext in silences (unsaid daughter words) and implication (breath frees). Complexity in artist's epiphany amid eternal seeking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Marina POV with perceptual signature (light accumulation metaphors); voice lyrical yet grounded (smoke-taste name). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You reveal what's hidden"), advances via woman's lean. Rhythmic modulation peaks at dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "dark knot loosened, unwound"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (ink in water, stars in fog) propel without muddle. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura as breath-healer via compassion crystal transforms spiritual tropes into tactile release mechanic. Risky accumulative lyricism (pinhole memory to pollen light) inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes of unseen emotional storage.</comment>
