<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's reluctance ("hated every twisted branch") conflicts with conscience-driven choice to guide hikers, earning realization that reconfigures entrapment as purpose with permanence cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nut discovery causally enables blueprint path assembly ("engravings showed how to assemble"), tightening to CR closure where etched knowledge forecloses escape, felt in "someone had to stay."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mechanical birds' patrols constrain rescue by creating "corridors of safety through their absence," charging climax; cliffside orchard's reforming paths filter through Maren's geometry bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost deadline escalates stake to save hikers, causal agency in intention-walking narrows options, cost legible in nut crumbling and Maren's return to labyrinth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Curse-as-gift theme emerges implicitly from rescue and aunt's "final teaching," resonant in final image of walking back "finally understanding," reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("paths that reformed itself") modulates under stress; minimal dialogue natural and urgent ("Follow exactly where I've walked").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; "leaving impressions without touching the ground itself" integrates action, specificity, and voice seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Intention-based path assembly from nut-blueprint transforms labyrinth trope into fresh geometric will-exercise, risk heightens stakes inevitably to CR closure.</comment>
