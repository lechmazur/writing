<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between fault-tolerant certainty and margin-honoring truth act in scene via delirium confession and recalibration decision, earning closure change with cost of accepting past error. Interiority concrete and embodied in trembling hands and swallowed stone. Eva's ghost anchors reflection to tilt present choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observation to CR closure in "certainty is what killed her," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of methodological shift. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via post-fever realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mountain station and auroras constrain choice and charge final image: dawn light backlights illustration, air steadies hands for recalibration. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (snowpack sensors, cold lungs). Details evolve causally with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of swallowed truth tightens texturally via realization, forcing agency in recalibration that forecloses old method amid Chen's warning of false positives. Cost legible in accepted trade-off. Escalation driven by protagonist's post-delirium stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth in margins emerges organically from illustration's edges, smudge, and sensor shift; final image of glowing flowers offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting certainty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature on edges/margins; rhythmic control modulates from sorrow to resolve. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual in Chen's warning. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: purposeful "margins" recurrence pattern-taught, no loops or scaffolds. Varied rhythm accelerates to closure image; zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forecasting metaphor transforms grief tropes via fault-tolerant margins and auroral imagery; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes organically.</comment>
