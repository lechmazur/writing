<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in Mara's trembling hands and decision to proceed despite accumulating silence; final choice to "ground you properly" earned by her mirrored brokenness. Boy's secret revelation forces her micro-choice with embodied cost. Interiority concrete and particular, no stock epiphanies; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from knot work to secret revelation to cascade unraveling, with Charged Poise closure as she drives needle into net's heart, reconfiguring silence as "Emptier. Heavier." Cost legible in her added silence and reaching for next knot. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism starlight constrains perception ("anxious blues and greens" on boy's face) and charges final image of fractured mask reflecting light; net's salt-stiff knots tactile and lived-in. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Mara notices voices/memories in knots). Micro-setting (needle, mask) shapes choices; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing spirits vs. her silence cost) signaled early, deepens via boy's secret tightening options—not peace but confrontation. Agency in proceeding with unraveling forecloses easy hush maintenance; cost unmistakable as sound fills then heavier silence returns. One decisive intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth-over-peace emerges organically from net's knots holding accusations and Mara's silence collection; final image of her reaching for next knot offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting her "failure" as endurance. No moralizing; ambiguity in "not the same as peace" lingers with complexity. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (silence as "unfallen snow," "held-breath moment"); voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, diction controlled (e.g., "phosphorescent like deep-water creatures"). Boy's dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Will it hurt?"); distinct from Mara's interior. No head-hopping; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "threaded the tapestry needle with silver wire—the only tool fine enough"); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening but purposeful and pattern-taught; propulsion clear to closure. Zero artifacts in peak unraveling beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Net catching drowned spirits transforms ghost story trope into fresh synthesis of restoration and accusation; boy's secret-to-cliffs link inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in lucid supernatural logic without retreat; non-obvious moral calculus elevates. 9+ test met with risk heightening stakes.</comment>
