<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Worrying the worry stone embodies her anxiety across beats, revealing character-specific chess philosophy under pressure; final smile through tears earns arc with exile's cost, satisfying contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as chess moves build geometric responses to RR closure; nexus steadying and new position deliver on-page cost in her validated exile, with clear orientation by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nexus hum, iron-ozone air, and static skin constrain her wait and charge final harmonious shift; selective sensory hierarchy reflects chess-trained perception, mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Early stake of covenant collapse tightens via correlation deepening communication options; her precise moves drive agency under accumulative lens, with moon phase foreclosing paths visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in chaos emerges via chess-geometry synthesis, reweighting exile without moralizing; final interweaving position offers non-literal answer to balance, charging image organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with chess-perceptual signature ("movement was a sentence translated into silence") modulates rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression teaches pattern, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from setup to climax without loops; geometric metaphors cohere without muddle, though slight repetition of "thoughtfully, precisely" is voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Chess as silent philosophy for magnetic covenant boldly transforms communication trope; synthesis feels inevitable from her traits, with risk-taking in geometry-chess fusion heightening stakes.</comment>
