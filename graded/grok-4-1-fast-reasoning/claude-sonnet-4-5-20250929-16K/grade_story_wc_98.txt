<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect memory drives micro-choices like dream interpretation and seed-planting, with embodied "luminous doubt" showing contradictory impulses acting in the realization beat; earned endurance forecloses inaction with felt scope of erosion as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build from climb to dream vision to planting; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in dream-space shift ("details returning") with time/monsoon cost legible in final image.</comment>
