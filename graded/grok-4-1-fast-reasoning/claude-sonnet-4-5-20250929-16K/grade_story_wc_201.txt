<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene—hand spasms involuntarily then forced to fist, later surge endured without fight—earning final gentle touch of strap as earned reconfiguration with visible cost of perpetual change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density and pattern breaks (forest dims/absorbs pain) build to CR closure in dawn image reweighting enhancements from hated curse to mapped grace, cost legible in "forever changed" and "penance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forest bioluminescence constrains and charges: glow intensifies at tears, dims at touch, mirroring internal transformation and enabling equation-carving as micro-setting that shapes final perceptual acceptance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of mercy) signaled early tightens accumulatively via harder surges forcing endurance choice; cost unmistakable in bodily screams and incomplete equations, charging poised hike back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-as-transformation emerges organically from carvings ("mercy = transformation—energy redirected") and forest response, final image non-literally reweighting cruelty equation without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in enhanced sensing ("soil density, root structure") biases notice character-specifically; rhythmic control heightens surges without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "fingers traced... because removing it might sever"), varied rhythm; minor surge repetition purposeful, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of interrogation grafts and bioluminescent math penance feels inevitable; risk in proprioceptive overload transforms trauma trope, heightening stakes via forest's responsive logic.</comment>
