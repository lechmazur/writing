<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcella's motivation rooted in pacifist silence-cataloging drives intuitive tuning choices with embodied emotion peaking in "understanding blooming" realization; minor epiphanic phrasing slightly undercuts contradiction depth without touching closure change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered frequency tunings building to CR closure at clasp click and diary reveal; cost legible in emotional reconfiguration of pacifism views, with tightening via failed-then-successful vibrations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop with salvaged gear and starlight constrains tuning setup and charges final image; sensory details like "low thrumming" and clasp warmth filter through POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of non-violent diary recovery escalates accumulatively via hesitation/protective/love frequencies narrowing to success with agency; cost felt in tears and reweighted beliefs, though one decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-through-witness emerges organically from parallel silence/resilience catalogs, answered non-literally by diary contents reweighting Marcella's pacifism; no moralizing, resonance in clasp's willing closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in frequency metaphors and rhythmic prose; voice modulates theatrical sincerity under revelation pressure, diction biased toward sonic textures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful figuratives like "vibration felt more than heard"; zero loops or scaffolds, propulsion peaks cleanly in clasp click without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic pacifism unlocking emotional legacy transforms locked-diary trope; risk in silence frequencies as plot engine inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
