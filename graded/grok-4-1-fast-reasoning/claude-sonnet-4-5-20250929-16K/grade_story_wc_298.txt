<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's reckless idealism drives contradictory impulses—certainty crumbling yet choosing to try—earned through past trades and Kael's demand, with final hand-taking revealing values hierarchy and cost. Kael applies relational pressure, forcing her micro-choice. Voice distinction clear in dialogue rhythms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal buildup to situational crystallization) holds; single scene anchors early (descent into orchard). Charged Poise closure in "stepped into the web...ready to unmake" with legible cost ("scars in the fabric"). No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots through bones and carved symbols constrain choices (Mira calculates via them) and charge final web image. Sensory details (phosphorescent fruit, amber shadows) selective via Mira's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (undo trade) signaled early, tightens via Senna revelation and Kael's grip, narrowing options under situational lens. Agency in her calculation and hand-taking forecloses refusal with felt scars cost charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bartered destinies' scars emerges organically from orchard imagery and trades, final image resonating non-literally (roots embrace bones as impossible gentleness). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "couldn't save everyone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (symbols as web via Mira's bias); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("Trade it back"). Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, distinct character idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy dialogue beats vs. flowing descriptions); no loops, coherent metaphors (roots as fingers/embrace). Propulsion peaks in "lantern trembled," clear causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of destiny-trading in bone-fed orchard transforms tropes via specific scars/logic; bold idealism's risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early symbols.</comment>
