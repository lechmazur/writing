<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation rooted in personal grief history drives consistent micro-choices like courtyard listening and approaching Iris, with embodied emotion in "sandstorm calm." Internal conflict subtle but present in balancing curiosity and reverence. Minor therapy-speak in "grief needs witnesses" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: neighborhood fragments build density to Iris's return and mailbox opening as Charged Poise RR, with legible cost in Iris's crumbling. Orientation anchored early via locket and apartment. Single-shard progression with one tightening at crying intrusion; closure cost felt in "didn't look like she was running."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard at dawn vividly sensory-selective ("bougainvillea the color of fresh wounds," fountain gurgle), filters through Maya's healing bias, and constrains choices by enabling dawn gatherings that charge final communal image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking grief via listening signaled early, tightens accumulatively through gossip density to Iris intrusion forcing direct agency. Cost legible in Iris's vulnerability and Maya's sustained presence; one deepening suffices but lacks sharper trade-off at mailbox climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening as active curation emerges organically from courtyard fragments and final image of Iris hearing community like "plants hear rain." Resonant non-literal answer in locket reprise avoids overt moralizing. Minor drift toward tidy resolution tempers higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in reverent object-handling and dawn bias. Voice rhythmic and textured ("purposeful and serene despite the chaos"), dialogue subtextual and goal-driven in Iris exchange. Minor elevated diction in reflective passages fits curator voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and image integration; opening line anchors stakes effectively. Minor metaphor density ("sandstorm calm" reprise purposeful but borders overwrite in courtyard descriptions). No loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thrift curator as grief detective transforms found-object trope into communal healing via dawn vignettes. Risky quiet closure feels inevitable from accumulative particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
