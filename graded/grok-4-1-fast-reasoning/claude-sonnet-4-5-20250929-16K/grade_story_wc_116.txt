<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to witness change is embodied in unfolding swan and reverent refolding, compelling incorporation of refuge with felt weight. Interiority particular via decay observations, but contradictory impulses subtle rather than acting simultaneously in peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in swan's self-folding and tucking refuge, reconfiguring perception of time/library with conceptual cost of loose reality grip; orientation anchored early in descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Overgrown catacombs vividly constrain actions (roots burrowing, damp air); origami swan as recurring micro-setting charges final fractal image, mirroring internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of non-judgmental witnessing tightens texturally via refuge-induced vision narrowing to inevitable loss; cost legible in "weight" of observation altering self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative cycles emerges organically from decay-to-flowers progression; final shelf placement offers non-literal repricing of wisdom in losing, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in transformation-noticing (e.g., "books transform from doctrine into pulp"); rhythmic modulation heightens reverence at refolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in descent-to-vision arc; purposeful lyricism avoids loops, though minor figurative density risks slight overwriting in root/ceiling passage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami chronicle and obsidian gravity transforms decay trope into fractal prophecy; risk of nonlinear time vision heightens stakes organically.</comment>
