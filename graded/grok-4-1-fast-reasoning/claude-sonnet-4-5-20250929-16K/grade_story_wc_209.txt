<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's postcards drives consistent micro-choices like tracing etchings and repainting panels; interiority embodied in hand-work focus. Minor slip: epiphany lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, leaning toward tidy realization over internal conflict at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with seasonal/light patterns building to CR closure via window discovery repricing mural approach; cost legible in foreclosed wall attempts. Orientation anchored early in pavilion; one tightening at etching revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and rose window constrain choices—light angles reveal etchings, inspiring panel painting; sensory light shifts mirror internal states purposefully. Recurrent glass layers charge final mural image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (answer question/true mural) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failed attempts to window realization narrowing options. Agency in climbing/tracing forecloses wall path with felt time cost; pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of shadow-preferring beauty emerges organically from postcards, failed murals, etchings to final panels; resonant image reweights without moralizing. Minor thematic echo in closing lines ("some beauty needs shadow") borders statement but ties to prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light-obsessed noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet observation to revelatory cadence. No head-hopping; diction selective and biased toward artist's illuminations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (honeyed pools, blazed blooms) supporting lyric texture; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in light descriptors risks density dip but serves accumulative drive without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist block, night flowers, and etched cathedral glass transforms epiphany trope; window revelation inevitable from light motifs. Risky lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
