<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority fuses math with grief in "mathematics of emotion," earning realization via ritual; embodied tears follow stone patterns, revealing hierarchy of values without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure in dew numbers reweighting loss as transformation; on-page cost legible in "negative space in the equation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mosaic stones constrain kneeling and charge final tears-as-grout image, mirroring internal states; stalactite drops enable ritual, evolving with bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to formula for forgetting tightens via rapid shoot/flower under Accumulative lens, agency in planting/whisper foreclosing recovery path with emotional cost in tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fibonacci flower and tears reweight premise of diminution as state change, emergent from particulars without moralizing; ambiguity of wife's fate lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct geometric/mathematical perceptual signature ("cracks dovetailed perfectly") stable in third-limited POV, modulating rhythm with revelation intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in "each drop took centuries to fall, and the apples they fed tasted of patience" propels without loops; varied syntax breathes with scene cadence, no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conjuration, emotion-math, and cavern ritual transforms loss tropes; dovetail motif risks bold perceptual ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
