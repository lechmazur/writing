<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses toward stability and flux act in scene via creel search and basin feeding; final identity shift as "librarian and fisher both" earned by causal buildup with cost of self-forgetting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from shelf migration to glowing basin, landing CR closure in scroll's dimensional fold that reconfigures preservation with undeniable conceptual cost of flux.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains choices like gear-assisted reaches and basin ritual, charging final scroll emergence; sensory details (whirring cogs, rising water) mirror internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of wonder-preservation tightens accumulatively via creel/pages discovery to smelting, agency in feeding contradictions foreclosing rigid stasis with cost of perpetual rediscovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in flux emerges from particulars like migrating books and smelt scroll; final "self is a tide" image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tidal perceptual signature (ocean rhythm, gear hum) and rhythmic control sustain pressure to closure; purposeful lush diction fits lyric accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from atrium breath to "wintersun serenity bright and cold," clear under ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tidal library with titan-gear and tomorrow-less world synthesizes fresh preservation metaphor; risk of fluctuating reality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via scroll's dimensional truths.</comment>
