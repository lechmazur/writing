<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via embodied ritual (weathered hands ache) and contradictory impulses (resurfaced pain yet patient transformation); final endurance of tending constellation earned by causal buildup of polishing specific memory-shards. Motivation rooted in fire-loss compels higher-stakes placement of daughter's-memory glass with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory-glass polishing builds to Charged Poise closure in placing white shard high on wall, reconfiguring brokenness into shared light with undeniable cost (daughter's laughter memory, finger ache). Orientation anchored early (cliffs to grotto); single scene tightens once meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto and embedded sea glass constrain choices (polish on stone table, place in wall gaps) and charge final image (morning sun on new shard); sensory mist/light filtered through Mara's priorities, vivid yet economical. Recurring sea glass as micro-setting evolves with action, mirroring internal stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform memories into fireless light) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening density of specific glass-memories and weeks-long polish achieving stillness; agency in placement forecloses escape-path with visible costs (ache, resurfaced loss). One tightening sufficient, coheres to lens without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-light transformation emerges organically from sea glass ritual and fire-backstory, reweighted in final constellation-tending image without moralizing; subtext in "pearl of stillness" shifts brokenness purposeful, resonant with conceptual cost of earthbound endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (light-sharing bias, mist-softened edges); rhythmic prose modulates reflective calm to ache under memory-pressure, distinct texture in syntax evoking ritual patience. No elision or head-hopping; voice coherent, lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line advances ritual/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative (mist curls, glass sings) integrated without overwriting in peak polish-beat. Minor repetition of "memories resurfaced" pattern-taught for accumulative effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-ritual via sea glass "gem polishing" transforms healing tropes through specific fire-aversion and constellation payoff; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in memory-transmutation without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
