<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's outsider motivation drives pattern-seeking with embodied intensity (chest unlocking); earned realization forecloses isolation via prior micro-choices like feather analysis and data cross-referencing. Chen's supportive pressure reveals her ingenuity without dominance. Minor tidiness in epiphany phrasing slightly undercuts contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns densify from feather to jellyfish data to plankton bloom; CR closure in "rhythm of belonging" recognition reconfigures outsider premise with felt emotional cost on-page ("something unlock in her chest"). Orientation anchors immediately in dome/Pacific. Single tightening via rising lights suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome glass and drowned ruins constrain observation, mirroring internal search and charging final plankton image. Sensory selectivity (bioluminescent glow, kelp scent) reflects Mara's priorities. No white-room; spatial coherence tracks hand-squeeze at glass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant belonging stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through shared patterns to lights' cadence shift, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in night work/endurance yields visible relational cost (hand squeeze amid outsider arc). One deepening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Belonging-as-spatial-discovery emerges organically from feather/ley lines/jellyfish to final luminescence without moralizing. Resonant CR reweights premise via plankton image. Minor directness in "next verse in a very old song" dialogue echoes theme too overtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (star charts to ruins); distinct rhythmic texture modulates from mystery to wonder. Dialogue natural/subtextual advances theory ("convergent energy lines?"). No head-hopping; diction fits mystic-scientist idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (feather drifting, lights rising); rhythm varies with scene acceleration to dawn. Purposeful figurative layering ("shadowseam wonder") without muddle or loops. Minor density in opening risks slight overwriting but supports voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrology/ley lines in drowned city transforms sci-fi tropes via spatial belonging premise. Patterns' inevitability and mystic-science convergence feel organic. Risky underwater lyricism heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
