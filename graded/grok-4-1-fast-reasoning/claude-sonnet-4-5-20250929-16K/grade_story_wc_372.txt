<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in dedication shifts convincingly from preservation to transformation, with embodied clarity ("hurt more than the cold") and micro-choices like reweaving under pressure earning the final renunciation; contradictory impulses between utility and deeper truth act in scene without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of resonance sampling to Charged Poise closure in capsule release with conceptual cost of library's fall legible in final image; orientation anchored immediately, single scene coherent, no micro turns disrupting drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz hush and freezing ink concretely constrain actions like ledger writing, charging final edge gaze; sensory hierarchy (humming frequencies, breath constellations) filters through Celeste's priorities, evolving with failing levitation to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of library's death signaled early escalates via readings-forcing transformation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to renunciation with felt cost in standing amid descent; one tightening (slide's adaptation) driven by agency suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive memory emerges organically from vows' reweaving to seed, final capsule fall reweighting preservation premise without moralizing; recurring frequency images shift from decay to propagation, inviting ambiguity on permanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice with perceptual signature (frequencies as living patterns) stable and biased toward resonance; rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure without head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and rhythm (needles' dance, crystalline script) propelling to closure; minor figurative density in opening but purposeful and non-muddled, no loops or scaffolds dulling peak reweaving.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystalline archive fantasy with frequency-seed transformation feels inevitable from particulars, risking quiet poise ending that heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
