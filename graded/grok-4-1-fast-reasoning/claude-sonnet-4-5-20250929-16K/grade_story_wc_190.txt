<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's expertise shines in micro-choices like nodding silently and pointing to the vial, revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in embodied experience; man's grief posture grounds his stakes without stock phrasing. Internal endurance of repeated passages earns her stance with felt cost in the log entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ascent decibels to post-whistle hush, culminating in Charged Poise closure via man's palm on vial and Mara's log reconfiguring grief as ongoing transit with endurance cost; orientation anchors in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drifting terrace and prisms constrain transitions and charge final image by mirroring internal shifts through light like "slow water"; storm glass vial as micro-setting evolves with crystals, filtering Mara's priorities tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding silence tightens via man's "Does it get easier?" forcing Mara's rephrasing response, narrowing to endurance with legible cost in log's "difficult passages"; agency in silence cultivates pressure coherently under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence comforting echoes emerges from vial crystals and prism light shifts, resonant in final log image reweighting transit without moral; subtext in unspoken "My sister" invites ambiguity on grief's patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature biases toward sound gradients and crystal formations; sparse dialogue natural with subtext, prose rhythm modulates from ascent chaos to terrace hush without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("crystals blooming and dissolving") with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, purposeful lyricism like "hush vaulting upward" breathes with scene without overwriting peak hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief gondola transit and storm glass transforms silence trope via prisms' light logic; risk in quiet endurance closure feels inevitable, heightening stakes through geographic/internal overlay.</comment>
