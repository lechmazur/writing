<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of "cheerful gloom" embodied in smiles not reaching eyes and bright voice amid sadness; childhood backstory anchors motivation and compels final covenant promise with felt cost of acceptance. Interiority particular via path-memory interactions. Final renunciation of catastrophe assumption earned by sequential transliterations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from emotion fragments to vine revelations to seed choice, culminating in CR via "conjecture into covenant" where bearing witness reconfigures preservation with conceptual cost of necessary temporariness. Orientation anchored immediately in cave/geode. Single scene coherent, no shards/transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Geode walls pulsing "rainbow light, beautiful and cold" mirrors internal states and charges final palm-press hum; vines/crater glass constrain choices (wrist wrap, transliteration). Sensory selection (warm glass, cool walls) POV-filtered by recollectionist priorities. Micro-setting evolves with sprouts, approving brighter pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via revelations narrowing to "walked only once"; final stance crystallization pays conceptual cost in sorrowful acceptance. Agency in planting/tracing drives deepening. One pressure point sufficient, charges poise in promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory/paths as "sea-foam—beautiful, essential, and heartbreakingly temporary" emerges organically from particulars (grandmother's road, single-walk revelation); final "I'll remember you" reweights via witness-preservation without moralizing. Subtext in bird's understanding eyes and approving walls lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of optimistic melancholy ("cheerful persistence"); rhythmic modulation in short declarative promises vs. lush descriptions fits emotional beats. Murmurs natural/subtextual ("Missing pieces everywhere" masking ache). No dialogue overload, voice distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punches like "Paths need footsteps" amid fluid lyricism); high density integrates action/image ("pressed the crater glass... luminous text"). Minor metaphor density in opening ("memories dissolving into mist") purposeful for tone, no muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy (emotion-transliterating glass, chrono-bird seeds mapping erased paths) into poignant CR on memory's fragility; transforms loss trope via "repetition anchors existence," risking lyric fantasy that coheres inevitably to final covenant.</comment>
