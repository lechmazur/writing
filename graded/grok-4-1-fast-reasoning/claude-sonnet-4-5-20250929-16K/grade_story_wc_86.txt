<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Characterization excels in embodied motivation and micro-choices like pressing palm to wall and offering drawer pull, earning the closure agreement; distinct voices in sparse dialogue reinforce traits without convergence. Minor diagnostic phrasing in "uncommonly thoughtful" slightly abstracts interiority but doesn't touch pivotal reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with revelations tightening to Charged Poise closure ("Next moon," he agreed; shift in space between them), cost legible in "composing the uncomfortable truths she would demand." Single scene oriented instantly at parapet; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist, wind, moon constrain choices (hushed voices, side-by-side exposure) and charge final image (mist thickens, valley lights flicker as uncertain stars). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific; weather evolves causally without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace via truths amid government pressure) signaled early, accumulates density through drawer pull reveal narrowing options to synchronized histories; agency in Mara's proposal forecloses quick terms with felt cost to superiors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes emerges organically via drawer pull's reprise ("attempt mattered"), offering resonant non-literal answer in final "difficult country between apology and forgiveness" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (grooves carved by time); dialogue natural, subtextual ("We're in between"), advances plot. Rhythmic control modulates hush to shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; no loops or artifacts dull closure image ("moon continued its patient arc"). Minor repetition of "method" purposeful, voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-synchronized negotiation and salvaged object transforms diplomacy trope; drawer pull's tarnish-to-beauty arc feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
