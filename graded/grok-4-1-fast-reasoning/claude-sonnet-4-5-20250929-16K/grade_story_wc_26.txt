<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "each word a small betrayal," earning endurance of her futile task; stone-handling reveals hierarchy of values with embodied cost. Interiority particular and concrete throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density from footage comparison to stone's final press, delivering Charged Poise/CR where fading smudge makes conceptual cost legible ("most honest thing"). Orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Clouds as "breathing cotton" and stone's condensation constrain reflection, charging final image; POV-filtered details like "blossom-laden windows" mirror internal erosion purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of documenting hope's erosion tightens via personal realization ("hope required... courage—to be worn down"), forcing renunciation of preservation illusion with felt impotence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stone motif shifts from gravity reminder to "still heavy. Still real. Still hers," offering resonant non-literal answer to preservation vs. erosion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of noticing "topology of hope's erosion" and "shadow unbound" biases details distinctively; rhythmic control heightens under reflective pressure, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in lines like "rivers still carved canyons... violent, necessary, transformative"; varied rhythm propels to charged closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh dream-share world with libraries archiving faded wonder transforms dystopia tropes; risk of lyric stasis pays off in stone's inevitable conceptual weight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
