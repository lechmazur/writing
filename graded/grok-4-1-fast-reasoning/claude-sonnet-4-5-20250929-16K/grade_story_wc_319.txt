<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Feral degeneration into fox-like crouch contrasted with upright stance at end reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene; final choice to wear pendant and tend shelves earned by prior interiorization with persistent homesickness cost. Interiority concrete via ache in chest and frost on lips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of waiting and mist patterns tightens to pendant touch as decisive reconfiguration (mist resolves to shelves), with legible cost (homesickness shifts but endures). Orientation anchored early in garden; closure Charged Poise in final upright walk and reading.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen roses and mist constrain waiting/proximity choices, charging final image as garden reveals shelves; sensory hierarchy (light negotiating darkness) POV-specific to guardian's boundary obsession. Micro-setting as body/environment boundary evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dimensional homesickness) signaled early, tightens via interiorization to pendant agency narrowing feral passivity; cost felt in carried ache post-reconfiguration under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges via particulars (frozen thoughts, light borders), resonant non-literal answer in becoming "boundary herself" reweighting prior feral struggle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (boundaries everywhere, from petals to light); rhythmic diction modulates from foggy compression to clear poise at "She stood upright," matching emotional arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "light didn't simply exist; it negotiated") propels without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm, purposeful figures (petals as trapped thoughts) cohere in peak reveal without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian trope into dimensional boundary guardian, pendant as inevitable rekeying of feral stasis; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable "interiorizing exteriors."</comment>
