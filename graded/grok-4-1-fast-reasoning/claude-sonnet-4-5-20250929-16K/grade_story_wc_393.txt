<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation rooted in consistent guilt compels action at pivotal apology reveal; embodied emotions (throat tight, hands tremble, chest unlocks) show contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning final renunciation of inaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single scene anchors who/where/when immediately; Causal-Accumulative Hybrid lens holds with backstory revelations tightening stakes to Charged Poise closure ("walked into the gathering storm, feeling lighter"), cost legible in foreclosed regret.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shop's "vibrant hush," oil/wood smells, and tools constrain repair choice and mirror restoration theme; dust motes and lamp's warm circle charge final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver heart, turn apology to action) signaled early, tightens via Sarah sighting that narrows inaction option; agency in repair commitment forecloses regret path with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of broken things restored emerges organically from heart repair and Marcus's arc, resonating in final image without moralizing; subtext in silences (e.g., Mrs. Chen's tools down) invites ambiguity on forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (Marcus's doubt-tinged noticing); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Don't thank me yet"), advances plot; rhythmic modulation peaks in charged exchanges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but stacked metaphors ("light breaks through storm clouds," "shop held its breath") in realization beat verge on overwriting, muddling peak clarity slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaplain guilt and clockwork heart redemption transforms redemption trope; risk in metaphorical hush/storm frame heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
