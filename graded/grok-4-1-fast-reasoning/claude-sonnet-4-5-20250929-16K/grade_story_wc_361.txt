<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hurry past vs. Orin's "carrying wonder") act in farmer scene; final steady hands and realization earned by micro-choices with emotional cost of routine foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: encounters density increases to CR closure where "mentor wasn't truly absent" reconfigures hollow space, cost legible in "throat tightened" and purposeful tomorrow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora and pendant constrain stops/charge final shadow image; ridgeway path narrows mirroring internal tightening to steady hands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (routine nerves vs. wonder) signaled early, agency in pendant-use at farmer deepens to herbalist crystallization; time cost (dusk, deliveries) felt, pressure accumulates under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Germination motif shifts from routine delivery to myth-making legacy; final "fertile ground" image non-literally answers isolation, reweighting without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in aurora as "living grace"; dialogue subtextual (farmer's daughter drawings evoke Orin), rhythm modulates shaky to steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; "time seemed to thicken like honey in cold air" rhythms extension perfectly without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pendant's frequency for connection transforms courier trope into myth-germination; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable at humming closure.</comment>
