<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in "furiously tranquil" state, embodied through deliberate timer-setting and photo development under storm pressure; final endurance of vigil earned by prior micro-choices mapping scars. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously without summary. No unearned epiphanies or diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from personal photos to envelope negatives, culminating in CR closure ("carrying the atlas of everything they feared") with conceptual cost to censors legible in descent image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (climbing steps, observatory). One tightening via envelope reveal narrows to state violence stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory constrains choices (lightning strobes reveal unmasked faces; above-clouds isolation enables vigil); recurring copper dome and darkroom wires charge final healing map. Sensory hierarchy (thunder as "god clearing throat") reflects poet's priorities. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar-mapping vs. censorship) signaled early, deepens via envelope to state violence; agency in developing negatives forecloses protest path with cost (descent confrontation). Accumulative tightening reweights via pattern break in hidden scars. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of indelible scar-cartography emerges organically from photo development and censorship friction; final image ("map toward healing") non-literally reweights erasure premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like scarred hands holding grandchild. Counter-reading (state fear) adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (scars as "braille," storm as "performance"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "lightning bleached the world white." Elevated diction fits poet; no head-hopping or withholding. Prose as character: syntax mirrors tranquil fury.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "timer rang... scarred hands holding grandchild" advances plot/character/image); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts/muddled metaphors. Propulsion matches scene: short sentences in development beats. Zero scaffold; opening/final lines recharge motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of darkroom scars-as-map and storm vigil transforms censorship trope; envelope-in-timetable enables non-obvious reveal. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from early satchel cue. No derivatives; bold above-clouds frame.</comment>
