<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely in "throat constricted" and "claustrophobia screamed," driving contradictory impulses against fleeing; final triumph earned via micro-choices like tracing the spiral despite terror. Minor limit: competence dominates over compounding mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via organ vibrations building spatial density to compass-guided revelation; on-page CR closure in key retrieval and multi-corridor horror ("existed in all five corridors at once") with felt cost of collapse. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nexus, compass, and flagstones constrain choices (tracing spiral opens void) and charge final image (stars wheel properly); sensory hierarchy (sound warps sight) reflects explorer's priorities. Spatial choreography coherent amid shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim key amid mutiny) deepens accumulatively via organ-induced contractions narrowing options; agency in kneeling/tracing forecloses flight with collapse cost. Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion emerges from particulars (organ's "lonely, wistful melody," walls' refusal); final image ("even walls refused their own nature") reweights premise non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in comfort's strangeness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (architectural geometries over enclosure panic); rhythmic control modulates tension ("organ swelled to a crescendo"). Lyrical diction purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "spaces that folded into themselves like origami nightmares" purposeful, not muddled); zero loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in climax ("fingers closed on the key"). Varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spatial anomaly via organ resonance transforms ruin-trope; risk in multi-presence horror heightens claustrophobic stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early geometries.</comment>
