<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied insomnia ("hands remained steady") and contradictory drive to paint despite exhaustion compel the final earned endurance of finishing the canvas; flaws like haunting dreams complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of painted faces and visionary seeds build to CR closure in the completed canvas reweighting kindness as preserved script, with legible cost of honest tiredness; oriented early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Smog-filtered moonlight and withering greenhouse constrain painting choices and charge the visionary final image, with sensory hierarchy (saffron quiet, liquid moonbeams) mirroring internal threshold state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving kindness tightens accumulatively through visionary deepening that narrows to canvas completion; exhaustion cost viscerally felt, agency in persistent brushwork forecloses sleep path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kindness-as-script theme emerges organically from painted faces and dandelion seeds carrying lost syllables, with final canvas offering non-literal resonant answer recharging prior encounters without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of linguistic bias (Tangut symbols, syllables meaning "stranger-friend"); rhythmic modulation heightens visionary threshold without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through painting beats; minor figurative layering (liquid moonbeams, amber uncertainty) coherent and pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of endangered alphabets, insomnia-fueled portraiture, and visionary kindness preservation transforms urban indifference trope; moon-tipped brush reprise feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
