<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kael's interior reverence amid unmaking—touching books while inscribing runes—reveals contradictory impulses and earns her dissolution as felt cost, with motivation rooted in catalogued knowledge driving micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as library's collapse accelerates density toward Conceptual Repricing in "Kael set down her pen as the first wall became pure light," with legible cost in her fading and truth's irreversible release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Collapsing walls threading luminous cracks constrain her timeline and charge the final image of dissolution; sensory details like backward spring water filter through her guardian bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask Orian) tightens via accelerating collapse under Accumulative lens, with agency in tailored messages foreclosing escape option; cost unmistakable in library's—and her—exhalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of indirect nobility emerges organically from particulars like rune math and star charts, resonating in non-literal final image: "moved the world without ever leaving her collapsing sanctuary."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of temporal reverence; rhythmic prose modulates elegantly from purposeful motion to fading poise without filter excess or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied syntax propels from "ground iron gall ink pellets" to "the library exhaled its last breath," with purposeful figures integrated seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-lost librarian as world-mover via book runes transforms guardian trope; risk in graceful collapse heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via rune of drift's mechanics.</comment>
