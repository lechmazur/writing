<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation roots deeply in prophecy-haunted life and button-sorting instinct, with contradictory impulses (fate vs. agency) acting in her trembling hands upon clarification. Final sharing earned by causal buildup, foreclosing bound paths with felt life-cost. Interiority particular via buttons' emotions; no epiphanies unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sorting to patterns to echo clarification, culminating in CR closure where sharing reconfigures prophecy with legible cost in "paths forbidden." Orientation anchored early (warehouse, turner role); one tightening via jar-on-buttons suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Warehouse shelves, dust motes, cliff-nestled secrecy constrain choices (jar found amid crates, buttons sorted there) and charge final hum of "unearthed silence." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (button feelings over visuals); evolved with action (light shifts afternoon). 9+ gate met by setting-shaped tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscramble binding prophecy) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via button patterns narrowing to healing truth, forcing sharing agency with past-life cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in town square; one tightening forecloses doom option. Escalation agency-driven under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of distorted wisdom emerges organically from button-fastenings mirroring prophecy erosion, reweighting via unscrambled voices into healing without statement. Final image (east wind, hourglass "opening") offers non-literal resonant answer. Complexity lingers in generational chains; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (buttons as "constellation maps," silence "unearthed"); rhythmic prose modulates from whisper-sand to bold sharing. No head-hopping; diction character-bound (guardian instincts). Distinct texture heightens pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy revelations amid lyric flow); no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts—"amber sand whisper through glass" propels without overwriting. Propulsion aligns with beats; zero figurative muddle in peak (trembling hands). Read-aloud seamless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: buttons as decision-constellations unscrambling echo-prophecy transforms folklore trope via warehouse specificity. Risky accumulative frame feels inevitable; no derivatives, bold in button-language ingenuity heightening closure stakes.</comment>
