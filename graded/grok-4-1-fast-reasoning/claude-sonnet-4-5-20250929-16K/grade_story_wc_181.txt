<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between bewilderment and pursuit drive micro-choices like taking the cameo and carving her name, earning the final self-realization with conceptual cost of nonlinear identity. Interiority particularized through embodied headache from time-logic and breath crystals under dome pressure. No unearned epiphanies; change scales perfectly to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to Conceptual Repricing closure: final bathroom reflection reweights inheritance premise with cost of self-becoming-grandfather legible in "She had her grandfather's eyes." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; pressing cameo to tree tightens knowledge without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard dome constrains via thin atmosphere crystals and tree carvings fitting cameo exactly, charging final image under stars. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: glowing disquiet mirrors internal spirals. Details tactile and evolved (midnight galaxy view heightens disquiet).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling inheritance tightens accumulatively via undocumented tree discovery, forcing stance from bewilderment to acceptance; agency in systematic inquiry forecloses linear logic with cost of embracing impossibility. Pressure coheres to charged closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nonlinear spirals emerge organically from tree fruits, cameo socket, and self-carving, culminating in resonant CR: "between the first and last page" reweights time's premise without moral. Ambiguity lingers in "right time that had already passed," embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature fixates on time paradoxes ("apple fallen today might plant..."), modulating rhythm from disquieted lists to crisp final image. Voice lyrical yet controlled, no leakage; compression purposeful for insights.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; density peaks in reverse-bloom knowledge ("from conclusion to premise"), propulsion via varied syntax matching pressure. Figuratives integrated (trees "glowing with brightened disquiet"); final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear orchard inheritance synthesizes sci-fi tropes into inevitable CR via cameo-tree fit, risking bold time loops that heighten stakes organically. Fresh angle on causality through "spirals, not lines" feels singular.</comment>
