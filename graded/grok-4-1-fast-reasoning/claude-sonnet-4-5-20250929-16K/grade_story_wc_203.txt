<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to discover ceiling secrets, rooted in childhood letters, drives concrete micro-choices like tile removal; interiority shines in "reading buildings the way others read books." Ghost's desperation yields to peace via his agency. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses in Marcus slightly tempers perfection, but change is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dust patterns → ghost sighting → ceiling cracks → box discovery → documentation and ghost's fade (RR closure). One tightening at "hairline fractures... formed a map" narrows options. Cost legible in "the building exhaled" and loosened mainspring; orientation anchored early in ticket office details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains via ceiling crawlspace and shaft, charging final creak; sensory details like "rust and old popcorn" filter through Marcus's observant POV. Cracks mirror internal secrets purposefully. Micro-setting (mainspring in pulleys) evolves causally, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover fire truth) signaled early via ghost; agency in climbing tightens pressure, foreclosing ghost's entrapment. One reversal at photos' reveal tests commitment. Cost felt in ghost's wait and Marcus carrying "weightless burden"; minor abstractness in stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges via ceiling cracks and ghost, reweighted in final reflection "cracks we learn to see." Subtext in ghost's burden charges ending without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; final image answers seeing-the-unseen question obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("dust accumulation patterns"); voice modulates rhythm in ghost's whisper to lights' hum. Dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You can see me"). No head-hopping; diction fits technician's observant idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful "hidden" recurrence builds without loops. No artifacts dull closure—final "building exhaled" propels crisply. Minor paraphrase in reflections ("secrets... buried") but woven into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-seeing elevator tech uncovers circus arson via watch mainspring in pulleys, transforming haunted trope through mechanical/observant lens. Risk in ceiling-map payoff feels inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
