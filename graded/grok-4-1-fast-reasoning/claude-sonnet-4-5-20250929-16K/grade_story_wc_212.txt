<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of rage and serenity act simultaneously in steady hands prying the cap amid burning chest rage; final renunciation earned by grandmother's words and felt debt, foreclosing borrowed time with visible cost in withdrawn hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed discovery to vortex opening; closure as Earned Stasis lands on-page when she withdraws hands sensing "too smooth, too easy" texture with legible conceptual cost of aging or barren debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice pillar and frost tables constrain choices (cap wedged in floorboards, palms on melting ice); final footprints in frost charge closure image, mirroring shift from borrowed to earned time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring potential tightens accumulatively through vortex partial opening that reveals wrong texture, forcing renunciation; agency in pressing/withdrawing hands crystallizes stance with on-page cost of foreclosed restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of earned vs. borrowed time emerges organically from entropy decrease attempt and refusal; final image of silver footprints reweights premise without moral, offering resonant non-literal answer via patient work's grain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature in texture metaphors (grain/knots like wood); rhythmic control heightens pressure in vortex sound/image without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., fractals spreading, ice rewinding via action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, precise diction fits lyrical voice even in peak vortex beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heirloom seeds, entropy reversal, time textures transforms tropes; risk in conceptual premise heightens stakes, inevitable refusal grows from particulars without retreat.</comment>
