<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to learn buildings' language drives consistent micro-choices, from ignoring slips to rooftop interrogation, earning the final acceptance with relational cost of dropped pretense. Dr. Khoury's traits root her reveal in native fluency. Contradictory impulses act in scene ("I never questioned these slips" vs. "How old are you really?"), satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hint density (slips, seal) tightens to RR closure where pretense forecloses, cost legible in "You needed time to be ready." Two shards transition smoothly; orientation anchored by ~50 words. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop garden/meteors constrain reveal (seal "caught the streaks," griffin "seemed to shift") and charge final image, meeting 9+ test. Architectural details (cornices, keystones) filter through POV bias. Sensory integration vivid, purposeful (meteors as "punctuation marks").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/language) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via slips to interrogation reversal narrowing pretense option. Agency in "How old are you really?" forces stance crystallization; cost felt in reconfigured relationship. Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformative borrowing emerges organically from sugar-teas-lessons-truth arc; final "tracing the first letter" reweights premise non-literally, satisfying 9+ test. Subtext in "agreed upon lies" lingers with ambiguity. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (buildings "speaking," skylines of books); dialogue subtextual, distinct ("dead languages weren't much use" vs. "buildings never stop speaking"). Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; "patiently nimble" purposeful repetition ties to actions without loops. Minor paraphrase in early backstory integrated via present anchors. No artifacts dull closure; read-aloud propulsion clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Immortal tutor-architect premise synthesizes fresh via "language of old buildings," transforming vampire trope through linguistic eternity. Rooftop reveal inevitable from hints; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes (+0.3). No derivative hedging.</comment>
