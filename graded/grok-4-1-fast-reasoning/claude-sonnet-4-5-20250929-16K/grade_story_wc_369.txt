<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in thumb healing on sextant glass, rooting Kael's shift from maintenance to revelation; motivation intensifies credibly through micro-choices like reconstruction. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning toward competent discovery over internal crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pin-to-sextant-to-beam revelations building density toward CR closure; "The pin in her pocket felt heavier now" makes conceptual cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity or causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moonlight as micro-setting constrains choices (heals wound, casts dreams) and charges closure beam-speaking; labyrinth rings and storm evolve tactilely through Kael's navigation. Sensory selection POV-specific, mirroring her maintenance priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quantifying sorrow tightens accumulatively through deepening discoveries, narrowing to unquantifiable grace; agency in sextant reconstruction forces trade-off with visible cost in pin's weight and altered work. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, cohering under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of measured sorrow vs. enduring grace emerges organically from particulars like dream units to tree memories; final beam-images offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. No tidy binaries, embracing mundane complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in maintenance-tuned noticing (e.g., "walls carved with rings") biases details purposefully; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise with stable close-third distance. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies propulsively, accelerating in reconstruction beat without figurative muddle. Varied syntax and concrete diction (e.g., "silver light pooled in its curves like water") advance multiple layers cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified-emotion labyrinth with tree-ring dreams transforms tropes organically; risk in deconstructed sextant as dream-reader heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight via prior sorrow metrics.</comment>
