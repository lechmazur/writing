<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's interior conflict between security protocols and empathetic recognition of shared grief acts simultaneously in the confrontation with Marcus, earning her choice to offer volunteer access. Marcus applies targeted pressure as a mirror to her past, without stereotypes. Minor therapy-speak in reflections ("physics of letting go") borders diagnostic but anchors to present micro-choice without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: laser traces build to gap discovery, chamber reveal, and Charged Poise closure where Mira reconfigures barriers with felt relational cost ("I'll tell her about our new volunteer program"). One tightening via personal recognition suffices; orientation anchored early in farm description. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow maps contours and diffuses laser, constraining Mira's search and charging final passage back through "permeable stone." Sensory hierarchy (blue light, spore air) reflects her spatial priorities; evolves causally from haze to fading glow. Final image of "blue-lit sanctuary" recharges setting as healing space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intrusion threatening farm/investors) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to personal grief convergence, forcing empathetic stance crystallization. Cost legible in vulnerability of opening security ("Be gone by then"); one deepening via Marcus's motive suffices under lens. Agency in leading him out forecloses punitive path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of permeable barriers (physical/grief) emerges from laser diffusion, gap squeeze, and final release, reweighting premise without statement. Final image ("healing grew in darkness, teaching the physics of release") offers non-literal resonance to grief's topology. No moralizing; ambiguity in Marcus's desperation lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (spatial calculations precede thought); diction/rhythm modulates from efficient to quiet ("quiet between them felt like wildfire"). Dialogue subtext-driven ("Sampling" vs "stealing"; "Why?"), distinct voices. No head-hopping; elision of backstory cued concretely.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in discovery, breathing in dialogue); high density integrates action/sensory. Minor "permeable barriers" recurrence purposeful under theme, not loop; no scaffold or filter stacks. Slight overwriting in "wildfire—not loud or destructive, but inexorable" risks mixed metaphor but clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bioluminescent farm, spatial security, and grief physics transforms "familiar strangers" trope into organic recognition turn. Risk in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative templates. Final line's callback ("before the echo of morning birdsong") feels inevitable.</comment>
