<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaia's sensory-specific interiority and contradictory impulses (grief vs. pull to truth) peak in the revelation beat, earning her final choice to carry the weight with embodied cost; mother's traits emerge consistently through relational pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density cascades to Charged Poise closure ("Teach me," shard pulsing); mosaic shards taught early (~first 25%) with legible transitions converge coherently on pocket universe without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (rust/violet silence, moss/concrete shift) filters through Kaia's mapping bias, constraining navigation and charging final humming bay image; no white-room as bay evolves causally across universes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) signaled early tightens via shard's heat/pulling currents, forcing agency in navigation and culminating in trade-off choice with legible emotional cost; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love's dimensional weight emerges organically from sensory particulars and revelation, reweighting abandonment in final shard-heartbeat sync without moralizing; resonant counter-reading (protection's price) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sensory mappings as coordinates) biases noticing consistently; dialogue carries subtext (mother's exile eyes) and advances stakes naturally; rhythmic compression heightens under stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via sensory propulsion (e.g., "negative sound that mapped itself"); no loops/artifacts, figurative consistency (hot stones in chest) integrates without muddle in peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory multiverse weaving transforms parallel-world trope via idiosyncratic mapping logic; risk in mosaic structure heightens stakes, culminating in inevitable "Teach me" reconfiguration grown from particulars.</comment>
