<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Esoteric realist motivation roots choices in witnessing endings, intensifying through embodied building ("fingers stiff from tying countless knots"); contradictory impulses in transient belonging peak at descent, earning closure endurance with impermanence cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via monarch arrival and spiral growth to CR closure ("signal no one would see"), with felt cost of erasure in final image; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moss constrains dowel planting and evokes cupped fragility; grotto's aerial isolation charges final image of unseen witness, filtering through POV's esoteric lens (e.g., "moss-thick walls cradling clouds").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness last migration) tightens accumulatively as monarchs cluster on structure, forcing completion trade-off (stiff fingers, nightfall descent); cost legible in honest impermanence, charging poise at sunset departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked histories emerges organically via moth-monarch interplay, resonant CR in "carrying their ended future" reweighting erasure without moral; no tidy resolution, ambiguity in unseen signal lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("mathematics hidden in fungal networks," "paper made from whispers"); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density, elision of descent pays off in charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in action-integrated imagery ("proboscises taste her skin"); purposeful figurative consistency (labyrinth/sundial/clock) without muddle; minor repetition of "temporary" contained, propulsion intact to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aerial eco-elegy and signal-art transforms extinction trope via moth-wing knots; risk in improbable grotto heightens isolation stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
