<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Finder's intuitive skills create embodied contradiction—trying to forget war horrors yet compelled by riddle—earning shift to "finding the living" with cost of reopened wounds. Crow's motivation aligns via deliberate broadcast. Final micro-choice to pair leaves reveals values hierarchy without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: riddle density builds to leaf map and reunion, tightening via coordinates revelation. Closure as Charged Poise in shared leaves reconfigures separation with felt cost of silence/time. Journey shard transitions legibly; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cracked wasteland and scrapyard constrain journey choices; preserved leaf as micro-setting charges map reveal and final glow. Sensory hush (wind whistling) mirrors internal states, evolving causally. Professional bias (reading rubble/grooves) filters details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming distance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through riddle-to-journey turn narrowing isolation options. Finder's agency in solving/tracing forecloses retirement stasis with wasteland traversal cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reading death-to-hope emerges via particulars (grooves, veins); final leaves offer non-literal reconfiguration of distance without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures enriches ambiguity. Resonance reweights war premise through connection's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with intuitive perceptual signature (tracing grooves "feeling more than seeing"). Prose rhythm modulates hush-to-hope; dialogue subtextual ("Why the riddle?") pursues goals. No head-hopping; diction wasteland-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "Shadows moved through the preserved leaf"); no loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies for propulsion; minor figurative recurrence ("wild hush") purposeful, not muddled. Closure image clear, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-war bloodhound skills decode analog riddles for reconnection, transforming tropes via wax-vein maps. Quiet closure risks bold lyric poise, inevitable from established reading motif. No derivative echoes; specifics anchor vision.</comment>
