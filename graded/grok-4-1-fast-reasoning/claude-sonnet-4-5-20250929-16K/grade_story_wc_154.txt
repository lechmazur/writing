<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maya's translator instinct and shift from detached observer to collaborative healer earned by cast interaction and her "lotus-hearted ache" realization; child's shrewd innocence enables trust without stereotypes. Contradictory impulses (preserving vs. healing own wounds) act in scene, compelling final micro-choice with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from cast scrutiny to narrative emergence and joint translation commitment; single-scene coherence, on-page Charged Poise closure ("two translators sat together") with felt cost in shared vulnerability. Orientation anchored early in atrium post-surgery; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atrium's mist, fountain, twilight subtly mirror internal states and guide intimacy (mist "kissed their faces"); coral and cast as micro-settings constrain revelation and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maya's haze-altered perception without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory preservation signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cast decryption narrowing forgetting into actionable "map"; agency in Maya's offer forecloses isolation with relational cost legible in lean and embrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-remembrance emerges organically from particulars (khlong, coral whorls, cast notes), final image reconfigures loss as "testimony" without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures invites ambiguity on healing's permanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with Maya's perceptual signature (translator cataloging haze-softened details); dialogue natural, subtextual ("What are you trying to say?"), advances stakes. Rhythmic modulation peaks in charged closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "twilight leaked purple and gray" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "night-flowering jasmine" enhance without muddling peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cast-as-map and coral-memory synthesis transforms displacement tropes via translator-child crux; fresh "graft new meaning onto these old wounds" calculus risks bold lyric closure without gimmick.</comment>
