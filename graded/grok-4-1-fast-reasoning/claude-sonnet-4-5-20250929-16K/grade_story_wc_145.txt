<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices like scraping rust reveal motivation under pressure, with consistent atlas editor traits driving the realization; minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak insight prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through density build from message to phrasebook to patterns, landing CR closure in "some questions answer themselves if you learn to read the language of water on glass" with conceptual cost of cyclical time and implied danger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Condensation patterns and frozen lake constrain discovery choices and charge final image of mist-exhaling ice; selective sensory details (breath misting, rust residue) mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of river origins tightens via pattern match on charts, reweighting knowledge with agency in cross-referencing; felt cost legible in predecessor's disappearance and her resolve to venture, charging poise under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical return emerges organically from condensation rivers and "They don't begin. They return," offering resonant non-literal repricing without moralizing; final image reweights premise undeniably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with water-biased perceptual signature ("droplets didn't fall randomly"); rhythmic prose modulates elegantly under insight pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts, purposeful figures like "ice forming on glass" integrate without muddle in peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh hydrological twist of temporal convergence transforms tropes via condensation method; inevitable hindsight from early patterns to "rivers remembering," with bold quiet risk heightening stakes.</comment>
