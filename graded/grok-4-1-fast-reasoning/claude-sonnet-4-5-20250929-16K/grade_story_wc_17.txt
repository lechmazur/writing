<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to uncover walls' dreams drives micro-choices like activating visualization software, earning closure commitment; interiority embodied in trusting ivy's recoils. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in professional skepticism vs. perceptual trust. Final burden realization mirrors Eleanor's, with isolation cost felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density to CR closure; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Equipment whine beat tightens to breathing pattern, charging "corridor sighed" with conceptual cost of unbelieved truth. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage constrains entry ("pressed through hanging curtain") and charges exit parting; fireplace spills diaries tactilely. Sensory hierarchy acoustic-biased, mirroring internal awakening. Recurring ivy evolves, pressuring choices without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (walls' dreams) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via diaries/negatives/anomaly to burden assumption. Agency in gathering items forecloses ignorance path; isolation cost legible in "honoring the dreams of walls." One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of architectural consciousness emerges via acoustic particulars, not statement; Eleanor's frantic pages seed resonance. Final image reconfiguration answers premise non-literally, reweighting human-resonance dreams with burden cost. No moralizing, ambiguity lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with acoustic perceptual signature ("ivy seemed to whisper"); diction/rhythm modulates from mapping calm to urgent rustles. No head-hopping or filter excess; voice particular to cartographer's ear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels anomaly beat without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm in "recording equipment clicking softly" to "corridor sighed." No figurative muddle or template cadence; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo cartography premise fresh, synthesizing climate ivy and acoustic dreams organically; risk in conceptual CR pays off inevitably. Transformation of haunted house trope via emotional archaeology elevates beyond templates.</comment>
