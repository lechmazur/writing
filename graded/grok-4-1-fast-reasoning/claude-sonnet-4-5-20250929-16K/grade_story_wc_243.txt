<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory grief/exultation embodied in trembling fingers and dual emotions at jetty; final covenant change earned by locket catalyst with visible cost of facing own moments. Minor diagnostic phrasing in "proximate causes" insight slightly undercuts raw interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from locket arrival to writing beat; closure as Charged Poise in locket-wearing reconfigures preservation stance with emotional cost legible in "no longer as penance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blooming jetty and walnut ink thermos constrain kneeling/writing choices tactilely; twilight roses evolve to charge final image, mirroring internal shift with sensory salt/sweetness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation vs. avoidance tightens accumulatively via locket deepening knowledge; agency in pen-to-paper moment forecloses penance path with felt euphoria cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of small moments' weight emerges organically from ink facts and note-writing; resonant non-literal close in carrying laughter, but quoted note borders explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "facts" lists (hulls, nails); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure from mechanical motions to darkening ink oxidation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., ink thermos evokes method/memory); varied rhythm propels to closure, minor paraphrase loops in "small moments/weight" deduct lightly without dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink archivist premise transforms grief trope via proximate causes logic; risk of lyric reflection pays off in regenerated covenant without gimmick.</comment>
