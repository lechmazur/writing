<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's affectionate skepticism shines in the opening check and hand-squeeze despite warnings, with contradictory impulses (frustration vs. love) fueling the devising choice; earned change forecloses passivity with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via shock → geode ideation → three-week mapping → lexicon revelation; CR closure in final light-painting image reconfigures loss with no-cure cost legible in "delicate as willowglass" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Studio's LED array and camera constrain choices (shock setup, mapping photos); light-painting tools charge final image, with fractals and rainbows mirroring somatic pathways through POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to restore Iris tightens post-shock with agency in geode experiments narrowing to lexicon; cost felt in no-cure endurance, charging anniversary scene without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of visible invisible emerges organically from pill loss to mapped language; final camera adjustment offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Maya-limited POV with artistic perceptual signature (fractals as flowers/lungs); sparse dialogue carries subtext ("You felt that") and distinction, rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (fractals blooming/retracting) integrated into action; no loops, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious piezoelectric-artistic synthesis transforms telepathy trope into lexicon map; risk in geode invention feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
