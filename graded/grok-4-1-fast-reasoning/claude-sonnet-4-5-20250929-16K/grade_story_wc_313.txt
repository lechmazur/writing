<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots deeply in grandfather's loss, compelling her shift from hazard report to memorial proposal with embodied defiance; contradictory duty vs. preservation impulses act in her collecting photos and sending copies. Final renunciation of county orders feels earned through prior discoveries. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown via vigilant actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo trail discovery accumulates density to reconfigure stakes, culminating in Charged Poise closure—Mara's report and crowd arrival resurface town as memory, with insubordination cost legible in "called her insubordinate." Orientation anchors immediately in first paragraph. Single scene with taught time elision pays off cleanly; no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exposed mudbank and receding reservoir constrain Mara's path and discoveries, mirroring internal resurfacing; wind chime bookends charge final restoration image. Sensory details like "mirrored hush" and "purple threads" filter through her warden bias, vivid yet selective. Spatial choreography tracks descent to storefront precisely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve resurfaced memory vs. county erasure—tightens via grandfather link and Dutoit recognition, forcing trade-off in her defiant report; agency in scanning/sending photos forecloses bureaucratic path with felt cost of threats. Accumulative escalation reweights via discovery density to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory's defiance against erasure emerges organically from photo trail and label to final crowd/image resonance, reweighting drought as restoration without moral state; "watching over water meant watching over everything it touched" lingers as non-literal answer. Complexity in county's "clean slate" vs. living stories avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of humane vigilance; diction like "skeletal structures breaking the waterline like accusations" biases toward sacrificed lives. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in radio crackle. Rhythmic control modulates from hush to chime's break, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line weaves action, image, reflection without loops or scaffolds; varied syntax accelerates discoveries, breathes in hush. Figuratives like "defiant purple threads" integrate purposefully, no muddle in peak report-writing beat. Read-aloud rhythm flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drought-resurfaced town and photo trail to personal defiance synthesize fresh angle on erasure tropes, inevitable via warden's heritage; risk in quiet communal closure heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious Dutoit label reprise transforms artifact into memory crux.</comment>
