<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's shift from skeptic to architect of resonance is earned through embodied micro-choices like pressing the shell to the flower matching Anya's eyes, revealing contradictory impulses toward isolation and connection with visible emotional cost in choosing Anya's sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern build from shell whispers to garden-wide pulsing; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page when flowers evolve frequencies, reconfiguring quarantine with conceptual cost of prior stasis, taught early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Velvet garden's phosphorescent mist and memory-flowers constrain the demo (kneeling by Anya-eyed bloom) and charge final image of pulsing light, with sensory hierarchy (vibrations bypassing language) mirroring Mara's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving resonance archiving tightens via demo success forcing Anya trials, protagonist agency in interrupting Chen forecloses isolation path with felt relational cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of resonance transforming quarantine emerges implicitly from shell-flower harmony reviving laughter as "seed," final archive hum reweights isolation without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on connection's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "resonance structures" and "living architectures"; dialogue subtext sharp (Chen's hope-warring caution), rhythm modulates from whisper to ghostly hum without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (mist clinging ankles) with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "tragic radiant stasis" purposeful and coherent in peak demo beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory plague as resonance architectures transforms sci-fi tropes via garden-flowers and shell, with bold risk in lyric closure humming "ghostly resolve" feeling inevitable.</comment>
