<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alchemist's motivation rooted in daughter's death drives all micro-choices, embodied in trembling hands at recognition; patience shown physically constrains ritual pace; earned closure via memorized journey forecloses preservation with felt cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual builds density to map revelation (CR via starlight threads) and burning, with legible cost in flash paper's residue-free vanishing; single scene oriented early (orchard/crater by para 1); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard constrains via cold (breath crystallizing) and supplies discarded items for pattern; sensory hierarchy (frozen aurora, petrified branches) charges final residual glow; micro-setting (flash paper above plate) shapes closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate heartbeats to daughter's path) signaled early, escalates via pulsar entanglement revelation narrowing options under accumulative lens; agency in pouring starlight and burning forecloses stasis with on-page cost of memorized impermanence charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic entanglement and patient love emerges organically from heartbeat-map and starlight flow, reweighted non-literally in burning's release; final image of fading glimmer answers loss with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (starlight "remembers its origin"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "flame to the flash paper's edge"; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at charged poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with lines like "starlight...pooled in her palms like liquid silver" advancing image/action; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors (light tracing engraved lines); propulsion aligns with ritual's deliberate build to ignition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pulsar-heartbeat entanglement and flash-paper cosmography transforms grief tropes; risk in frozen-time ritual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pattern's causal logic; no derivative echoes.</comment>
