<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority via glazier-specific perceptions like "frozen liquid still dreaming of flow," with micro-choices (dropping stones, photographing) aligning to motive; grandfather backstory anchors present without drag. Minor lack of contradictory impulses limits to very strong, as harmony dominates over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stone drops build density to portfolio CR, reweighting preservation stakes with conceptual cost in "before the world committed to one future or another." Orientation anchored early; closure image (satchel) pays off pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains choices (hatch access, angled panes for refractions) and charges final image via light/ripples; sensory hierarchy glazier-specific, mist/dawn evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evidence vs. demolition) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via non-repeating patterns forcing documentation; agency in iterated drops forecloses inaction with felt deadline cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mundane value emerges via ripple/light particulars, final image ("carrying illumination") non-literally reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in glazier diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "patterns speak"); rhythmic control modulates from mist entry to dawn crescendo, stable close third-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "rings radiated outward, perfect and expanding"); zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figuratives enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier craft, optics, and preservation via ripple prisms; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
