<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in grandmother's dementia drives consistent micro-choices like requisitioning the chamber and matching flower patterns; interiority concrete in embodied gasp and grasping memory. Internal conflict subtle but present in patient observation versus urgent loss. Final recovery earned through prior causality with felt preservation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pocket discovery to stabilized recovery in chamber, tightening knowledge of memory redistribution. Orientation anchored early (dock lanterns, Tuesday whale). Closure as Charged Poise in crystallized memory and ongoing patient work, with undeniable cost in "slow, silent, and gleaming" search.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt crystal chamber constrains by stabilizing pockets, enabling exhuming; coffee grounds and pressed flowers as micro-settings charge discovery beats. Sensory details (warped air, spinning droplets, gleaming silence) selective and POV-filtered by Maren's ritual patience. Barnacled whale and inland drift evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover lost memories) signaled via grandmother's evaporated decades; accumulative escalation through pattern-reading discoveries narrows options to successful match. Agency in guiding pockets and testing flowers forecloses deletion path with patience cost legible in "weeks of patient observation." One decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of redistributed preservation emerges organically from whale's pockets, flower key, and crystallized recovery, avoiding statement. Final image ("searching for stars reflected in dark water") non-literally reweights loss as transformation with conceptual cost of patience. Particulars like vanilla taste and wildflower spiral resist platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "gleaming silence" motif and selective noticing (lantern ritual, coffee fractals). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from ritual silence to charged recovery without drift. No dialogue; compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "warped air hovering above the barnacled body" advances setting/action); rhythm varies for propulsion, read-aloud ear clean. "Gleaming silence" repetition pattern-taught, not loop. Minor figurative density in peak recovery beat controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whale as vessel for gravity-pocket memories fresh synthesis transforms loss tropes through lived dock rituals and crystal stabilization. Risky conceptual frame (deleted memories rest in leviathan) inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via irreplaceable particulars like coffee fractals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
