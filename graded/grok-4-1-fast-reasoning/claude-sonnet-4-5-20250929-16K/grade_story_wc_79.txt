<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's cartographic expertise and quiet drive create contradictory impulses—council denial vs. personal reed whistle cue—culminating in earned multi-whistle climax that forecloses ignorance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via revelation density from whistle play to shell cracks to expedition bodies, delivering on-page CR as turtles stop with conceptual cost of revealed guidance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brine caverns and cracking shells constrain descent and discoveries, charging final image where horizon watchers resolve from mirage to shepherds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of expedition truth deepens via pattern reveals forcing whistle escalation; agency peaks in 13-whistle play, viscerally charging city-stillness cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Illusion of freedom reweighted by livestock reveal emerges through shell spirals, final watchers' turn offering non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with cartographic perceptual signature—tracing whorls, Fibonacci holes—modulates rhythm to build dread without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high-density lines like "hairline fractures spreading in geometric sequences, releasing phosphorescent gases" propel across revelation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Spiral cartography and turtle-livestock synthesis transform migration tropes, with whistle Fibonacci risking bold pattern-language ingenuity inevitable at closure.</comment>
