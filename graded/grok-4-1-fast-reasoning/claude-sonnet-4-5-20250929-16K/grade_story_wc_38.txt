<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in lyrical defiance, with embodied emotions in the dance sequence; micro-choices like trailing algae and rolling dice reveal contradictory impulses (direct rebellion vs patient subversion) acting simultaneously. Final liberation earned through prior causality. Minor flaw: brief backstory summaries slightly abstract motivation before full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from journal encoding to dance, culminating in on-page RR (Charged Poise) as doors open, reconfiguring captivity with conceptual cost of transformed perception ("breathe differently"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via final dice roll suffices; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken laboratory and bioluminescent algae constrain dance choreography and charge final ascent image; sensory details (kelp sway, rust colonization) selectively mirror internal defiance through POV bias. Micro-setting (coral floor, spiral stairs) guides escape. Environment evolves causally with humming walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (autonomy via encoding) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to dance climax narrowing options; agency in choreographed movements forecloses direct rebellion path with felt cost of three-year wait. Pressure coheres under lens; minor abstractness in early stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of calm defiance emerges organically from journal metaphors and dance, with final image ("dance her way through") offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting vulnerability as strength. Subtext in spider web motif charges closure without moralizing. Complexity lingers in patient subversion's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, with perceptual signature in musical patterns ("dance equations"); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to propulsive in dance beat. Voice texture purposeful and character-specific, fitting code-breaker mind. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, with varied rhythm accelerating to "walls began to hum"; metaphors consistent in oceanographic lyricism without muddle. Minor overwrite in reflective opening (e.g., stacked similes) slightly dulls early momentum, but no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-as-code and lyrical encryption transforms escape trope; dice and journal weave inevitable ingenuity from patient particulars. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committing to premise.</comment>
