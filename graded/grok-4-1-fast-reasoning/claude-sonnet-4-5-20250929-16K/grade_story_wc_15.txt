<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's sleepwalking/waking contradiction compels her mapping and sewing as micro-choices under precedent pressure, earning her final descent with the cost of silent loom; interiority poetic yet embodied, though occasional epiphanic abstraction slightly dilutes contradiction in council scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from sleepwalk traces to communal paths and council confrontation, landing CR closure in "precedent...transformed, like thread...stronger" with undeniable conceptual cost to stasis; orientation anchored in opening wharf image, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, dust-coated nightgown, and carved channels constrain Mara's ladder descents and path-marking, charging final "red canyon air" image; sensory hierarchy (salt/stone rhythms) reflects weaver's bias, evolving causally with tide and sand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive labyrinth vs. precedent) signaled in sleepwalking discovery, tightens accumulatively via sewn panels drawing walkers then council, forcing stance crystallization; agency in offering plate shows cost to isolation, legible in empty wharf.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Communal weaving theme emerges organically from overlapping paths to "perpetual, communal becoming," reweighting preservation in final image without moralizing; orchid solace resonates as non-literal answer to ruin/reverence question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice with weaver's perceptual signature (threads as neural pathways, water through stone) modulates rhythmically under rising communal pressure; stable distance, purposeful compression in pattern emergence, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and rhythmic prose ("labyrinth breathed...tide pools would fill"), no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("overlapping paths...like neural pathways") touches non-closure beats without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sleepwalking unveiling communal labyrinth-weaving transforms preservation trope via grounded weaver's traits and canyon logic; fresh synthesis of ruin/reverence feels inevitable in council's fulfilled discovery, risking poetic fabulism without gimmick.</comment>
