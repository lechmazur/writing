<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority in "terror and ecstasy braided together" during first pattern, with contradictory hope vs. isolation driving micro-choices like oath-swearing; final extension earned by prior grief-transmutation causality, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density escalation from pattern-tracing to reality-shifts; Charged Poise closure in silver apple reflection reconfigures isolation with felt bliss/cost, orientation anchored early in greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Alchemical fruits and glass constrain choices (palm on panel, trees shuddering in sequence); final orchard across timelines charges image, sensory hierarchy (luminescence, chiming) mirrors knight's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief-to-possibility) signaled early, escalates via pattern-deepening under Accumulative lens; agency in unsnapping forecloses withdrawal with on-page cost in "shivering bliss" intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of allegiance to possibility emerges organically via patterns/oath; final apple image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting liege's dissolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (geometries whispering) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in "reality shivered," purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("electricity through copper wire") integrated into action; zero loops/artifacts, propulsion varies rhythmically without overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh marionette reversal synthesizes alchemical mysticism into inevitable pattern-choreography; bold reality-weaving risks heighten stakes, transformed via knight's specific extension.</comment>
