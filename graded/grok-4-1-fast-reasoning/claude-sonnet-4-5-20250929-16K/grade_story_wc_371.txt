<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete embodiment (bitter complicity taste) and contradictory impulses (guilt vs. persistence in planting); final endurance earned through prior noticing and revelation. Old woman's pressure reveals Mira's hierarchy of values without stereotypes. Voice-specific noticing persists under revelation stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries (tea house, bread, woman) build density to CR closure where Mira's watching gardens reconfigures her premise with complicity cost legible in "tasted bitter." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gardens constrain choices (push back erasure) and charge final image (wild roses, sage); selective sensory details (crust crackle, chrysanthemum sip) reflect Mira's bias. Spatial choreography clean in tea house pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (combat creeping normality) signaled early, deepens via bread/woman revelation narrowing to sacred persistence; agency in continued planting forecloses ignorance path with felt guilt cost. Accumulative tightening reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary sacred emerges implicitly from planting/gardens vs. erasure; final image (seeds beside bread) offers non-literal resonance reweighting complicity without moralizing. Particulars like caraway rye ground complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (noticing moss/vines); dialogue subtextual (absolution seek) advances stakes naturally. Rhythmic modulation peaks in revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short revelation sentences accelerate); no loops or scaffolds, purposeful metaphors (seeds remember) integrate without muddle. Propulsion clean through closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh guerrilla gardening as un-erasure archaeology transforms creeping normality trope; subtle magical realism risks bold synthesis, inevitable in hindsight via root/seed logic charging closure.</comment>
