<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in scarred hands and loosening chest; motivation to find purpose intensifies through pattern discovery compelling testimony decision. Minor epiphanic sheen in teacher quote but earned by frost-led micro-choice. Final endurance of survival reconfigured with felt relief cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns deepen ledger gaps for CR closure where being "geography" reweights survival premise with emotional cost in chest-loosening line. Orientation anchored immediately in canyon; one tightening via retracing suffices. Persistent ledger constraint shapes final tuck-away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns and warm stone selectively constrain insight method and charge final resonance image; canyon under stars mirrors glass/light motifs without catalog. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific to artist's eye for trapped light and flows. No white-room; evolves with dawn causal to revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose in survival) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via frost-deepened ledger pattern narrowing narrative illusions. Agency in retracing/studying forecloses tidy providence with realization cost. Pressure coheres to charged poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in gaps emerges organically from ledger pauses, frost paths, glass transformation; final walk reconfigures survival without moral state. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; counter-reading (diminishing vs empowering) lingers. Protagonist arc inextricable from pauses-as-purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with artist's perceptual signature in light/glass/frost biases; voice rhythms modulate from introspective to resolute. Prose texture distinct in syntax echoing cooling glass hum. No head-hopping; elision of man taught via ledger pays in realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion matches reflective escalation to decisive walk. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; frost-glass coherence clean. Minor register elevation voice-motivated for luminous artist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artist unwittingly hosting crime ledger, frost decoding criminal rhythm transforms survival trope. Non-obvious frost-led pattern break risks lyric reflection payoff. Organic tropes via specific canyon/glass logic; no hedging.</comment>
