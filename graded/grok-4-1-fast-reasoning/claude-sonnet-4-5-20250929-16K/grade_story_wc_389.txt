<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vera's arc from isolation to vessel is earned through accumulative interior shifts like laughing at absurdity and tasting copper in the storm, with contradictory impulses in refusing faction allegiance while broadcasting. Final realization ("work was just beginning") shows hierarchy of values with cost of ongoing isolation. Minor summary slips like "lonely visionary, they said" slightly dilute embodiment but don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fragments build to clear final message as CR, reweighting her role with conceptual cost of eternal purpose amid isolation. Orientation anchored early (observatory, radio). One tightening via accurate prophecies forming factions narrows her position without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico and storm constrain choices (pulpit/prison, pilgrims/soldiers) and charge final image under lightning where she receives the message. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, copper taste) reflects Vera's priorities; details evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (channeling shadows for dawn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via prophecy accuracy and factions forcing endurance/renunciation of sides. Peak pressure in armed camps arguing her transmission crystallizes stance; cost felt in her prison-like isolation paid visibly at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of variant allegiance/shadows-light emerges organically from prophecy arguments and her motivation, with final image ("storm break into morning") as resonant non-literal answer reweighting both/neither without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (storm-filtered, radio-whispered) and rhythmic modulation under pressure; prose texture distinctively lyrical yet grounded, fitting prophetic tone without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful repetition of portico/storm builds texture without loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("dance rather than speak") doesn't obscure closure; propulsion clear in unfolding fragments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-prophet in storm observatory transforms tropes via gritty-whimsical ancient shadows; final CR feels inevitable from fragments, with risk in open-ended dawn blueprint.</comment>
