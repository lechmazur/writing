<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority tied to musical liminality, with embodied reactions like breath catching and hands plunging earning the final inspiration surge; micro-choices reveal values in handling the program and journal under risky conditions. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents higher band, but change feels earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density from program to journal, with clear causal linkages narrowing options to the pit's gap; orientation anchored immediately in flooded pit. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final journal embrace, with cost of disrupted worldview legible in "dormant creativity" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like murky water to knees and bending lantern flames constrain choices (violin held high, hands plunged) and charge final breathing house image; POV-filtered through musician's ear for unstruck hush. Environment mirrors internal in-between spaces without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling inspiration tightens accumulatively through image/map discoveries forcing hand-plunge agency; one decisive deepening changes knowledge of music's nature. Cost felt in risked condemnation and foreclosed dormancy, though low external opposition limits to very strong band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-music emerges organically from notation gaps and journal, with final "something new would begin" offering resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing; subtext in pauses enriches without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature via musical metaphors (rests, unstruck chords); rhythmic control modulates from hush to surging inspiration, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful lyricism (e.g., "cathedral of ruin"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors, though minor recurrence of "in-between" is pattern-taught. Propulsion clear, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost lore via water-revealed silent notation transforms tropes organically; risk in liminal music premise heightens closure ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
