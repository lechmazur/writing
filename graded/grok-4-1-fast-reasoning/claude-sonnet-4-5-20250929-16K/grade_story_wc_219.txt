<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with skepticism driving the experimental pilgrimage; contradictory impulses peak in kneeling amid footprints, earning the transformative realization with felt cost to prior certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from amber to footprints' formula, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing at "The footprints were hers—not past or future, but somehow both"; cost legible in reconfiguration of self-understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective details like "bronze quiet" and "reddish dust" constrain descent and charge final image; recurring rain/tower light mirrors internal convergence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (test homecoming) tightens via footprints discovery under accumulative lens, narrowing skeptical hypothesis to inevitable convergence; agency in following/pressing amber forecloses doubt with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming-as-chemistry emerges organically from amber-fly parallel to footprints; final "formula remained" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of quantum self without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with scientific perceptual signature ("heart performing its own chemistry"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in descent beat without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via purposeful "chemistry" recurrence; no loops, with peak clarity in "quantum-printed by her own return."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobiology, quantum time suspension via amber/footprints transforms first-contact trope; risk in abstract-concrete blend inevitable at convergence payoff.</comment>
