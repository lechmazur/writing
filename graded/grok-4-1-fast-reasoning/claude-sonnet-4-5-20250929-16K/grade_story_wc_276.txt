<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's cool-headed fisher traits compel higher-stakes micro-choices like voicing silence despite fear "crystallizing in her spine," earning the closure's desperate hold with embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from wandering stars to anti-sound pause and spike pin; closure's "laugh poured out" delivers resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost legible in "transliterating silence into speech."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's vibrations "mak[ing] Mira's teeth ache" constrain tactics via dissonant chords, charging spike's anchoring; micro-setting of skiff hull filters through fisher's tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echoes' zigzag scatters options under chaos, deepening via "echo resisted... twisting like a living thing," forcing agency that narrows to spike's hold with scattering risk felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Feral lullaby motif emerges organically from "teeth and tenderness," resonating in final "daughter sing" without moralizing, reweighting grief-to-speech arc through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward fisher's harmonics; rhythmic compression peaks at "The rail spike thrummed. The laugh crystallized," modulating intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in multi-job lines like "drove the rail spike through the skiff's hull, pinning it"; varied rhythm avoids loops, though minor metaphor density in setup slightly dulls early propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations and voicing-silence paradox synthesize fresh world-logic, transforming mythic tropes via spike's iron equations; risk of chaos heightens stakes inevitably to closure.</comment>
