<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Maya's dual memories (five and eighty-three) acting simultaneously, compelling her rebellious drumming with embodied cost (fingers ache). Final endurance to return tomorrow earned by prior causality. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like the crushing weight complicate without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drumming cascades memories and waves to peak connection ("felt them all"), closing in Charged Poise as lagoon fades with felt cost (moment passes, aches). Orientation anchored early (slips into garden by para 2). One tightening via faster drumming suffices; closure image reconfigures persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's resonant stones and crystalline panels constrain choices, channeling drumming into ripples that mirror internals ("like her grandmother's hands"). Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (visible waves, "sang against her skin"). Lagoon charges final image, evolving causally to blaze then fade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive shared dream) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via drumming escalation narrowing to peak ("cathedral of vibration"), forcing endurance with on-page cost (aches, exhale breaks moment). Agency in micro-choices like faster rhythm forecloses ephemerality. Price legible in final stand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistence emerges organically from entangled memories and drumming, reweighted in final image of carrying thirteen lives eternally without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: guinea pigs prove possibility amid sorrow. Particulars like dual kisses avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "almost believe."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sound as color/ghosts/hands) biased to Maya's synesthetic rebellion. Rhythmic prose modulates intensity, compressing at peak ("drums faster, garden responds"). No elision or head-hopping; diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "drumming... watching waves bloom like... grandmother's hands" advances action/atmosphere/memory). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere without muddle. Propulsion peaks cleanly in climax without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory entanglement via sound-sculpted reality transforms sci-fi trope into tactile persistence dream. Risky lyric build heightens stakes; final "guinea pigs... prove what's possible" inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
