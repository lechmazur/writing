<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between skepticism and curiosity act in scene via seashell listening and retelling, earning the final conversion with embodied cost in "tears mixing with laughter." Interiority particular and concrete throughout; flaws like past myth-busting drive the revelation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from riddle fragments to full answer; CR closure lands on-page in "riddle's answer crystallized," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of skepticism's error, legible in blood-painting image. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's "acoustic sweet spot" and cliff wind constrain choices like voice projection and cello resonance, charging final hums image; sensory details (dust motes, bruised skies) filtered through POV, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through seashell/cello linkage narrowing skeptic-believer options; agency in plucking strings forces stance crystallization with felt cost in realized "magic" of memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-magic emerges from particulars like fragmented conversations; final CR image ("voices go everywhere") non-literally answers riddle, reweighting prior myth-busting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "gloomy cheerfulness"; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to revelatory, diction biased toward resonant imagery without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory/action lines; minor figurative density in opening descriptions but no loops/artifacts, peak revelation ("notes that shouldn't exist") clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting arc with acoustic ghosts via specific objects transforms tropes; risk in riddle's conceptual payoff feels inevitable from early particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
