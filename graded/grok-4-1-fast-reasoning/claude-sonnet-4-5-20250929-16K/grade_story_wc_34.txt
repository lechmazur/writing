<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Balladeer's motivation roots in parallel evanescence of her songs and ghost's messages, compelling higher-stakes encoding; interiority concrete via "half-singing, half-calculating" under storm pressure. Contradictory impulses act in her frenzied painting despite past failures. Final partnership earned by prior repairs and discoveries, foreclosing isolation with felt coherence cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bolt-tracing to graffiti encoding to circuit closure. On-page Charged Poise in "pressed the final bolt plate... blazed with color," reconfiguring silence with conceptual cost of voiced needs. Orientation anchored early in courtyard above clouds; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prayer-wheels and bolt plates constrain choices, from repair cue to final press completing circuit. Sensory hierarchy (humming touch, rattling thunder) mirrors musician's priorities, charging final "courtyard blazed" image. Atmosphere tensions isolation to communal song via storm integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of voicing forgotten prayers signaled in discovery, tightens via ghost-guided encoding narrowing to propagation. Agency in painting and pressing forecloses voicelessness; felt cost in "no longer alone" under Accumulative lens. One deepening via lightning revelations suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of voicelessness-to-voice emerges organically from song/prayer parallels to graffiti propagation. Final "clouds carried their messages" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of mechanical divinity. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in musical/code synesthesia ("symbols that hummed," "visual song"). Rhythmic control modulates from drifting focus to frenzied wonder; diction biased to artist's lens. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "gathered pigments... encode its message"). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful without muddle in peak painting beat. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical ghost, sky monastery, graffiti-code fuses art/algorithm organically. Transforms ghost trope via encoded prayers propagating aid. Risk in visual/algorithmic marriage heightens stakes, inevitable at "storm sang with them."</comment>
