<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sand grain placement as micro-choice ties family legacy to preservation drive, embodying contradictory sentimentality and resolve with visible cost of impending erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mounting preparations to dawn-triggered reactions, yielding Charged Poise closure in golden crater image where preservation cost reconfigures erasure stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Temperature swing and regolith constrain beacon placements and timing, charging final amber light image; sensory selectivity (e.g., "slope give way beneath her like history") mirrors POV expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Three-hour deadline escalates to reaction ignitions forcing endurance trade-off, with legible cost in crater's transience viscerally felt via chemical bursts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Preservation-vs-progress theme emerges organically from sand grain seed to golden finale, offering resonant non-literal reweighting of progress as erasure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of poetic geology (e.g., "asteroid's kiss") modulates rhythmically under dawn pressure, no elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image-reflection without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm peaks in "chemical fire" sequence propelling to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chemical ingenuity transforms lunar mining trope into textured endurance act, with sand grain synthesis feeling inevitable and riskily lyric.</comment>
