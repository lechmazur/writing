<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Potter's zen-rooted motivation intensifies through patient observation to earned change, leaving a timeline layer; interiority concrete in clay analogies and embodied centering. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal tending beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from pattern observations to CR closure ("sharp gentleness" realization adds layer with conceptual cost of self-integration); orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (smoke ribbons, prismed water) filters through potter's priorities, constraining choices via glass revelations and charging final thrumming image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance) tightens accumulatively via timeline discoveries and tending, forcing endurance with cost (extended stay, self-layer left); agency in care forecloses neglect path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of layered care resisting entropy emerges organically from tending acts, resonant CR in final image reweights premise without moralizing ("attention baked into every curve").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern/light noticing; rhythmic prose modulates zen calm to resonant crescendo, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short thrumming sentences build propulsion); purposeful figuratives like "kiln of entropy" enhance without muddle in peak resonance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timelines fractured by kindness transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via potter's attention craft; risk in lyric compression heightens inevitability of CR.</comment>
