<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots deeply in embodied grief ("luminous torment that made every breath shine with unshed tears"), driving micro-choices like shifting from paper to gem-embedded cranes; contradictory impulses (crushing weight vs. persistent crafting) act in scene; final endurance of transformed grief feels fully earned without epiphany shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-building crane sequence tightening to thousandth dream where shadow reattaches to lights (Charged Poise/CR closure); orientation anchors instantly in tea garden post-loss; cost legible in persistent grief-as-garden image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating tea garden and tools (gems, paper) constrain crafting choices and charge final illumination; glass basilica's descent/ascent mirrors internal paradox through repeated perception, evolving causally with dawn; sensory details (steam mingling clouds, chamomile) filter via Mira's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via communal shift and final diamond crane narrowing to reattachment vision; agency in persistent polishing/folding forecloses dissolution path; cost unmistakable in "love that persists after shadows detach."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief's paradox emerges organically from crane transformations, culminating in resonant final image reweighting detachment into enduring light without moralizing; subtext in basilica motif shifts from mockery to embodiment; complexity lingers in survival's dual descent/ascent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (light/grief synesthesia) and rhythmic modulation (lyric swells in crafting beats); diction controlled and voice-motivated (e.g., "frozen music"); no elision issues, full legibility under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., polishing reveals "inner architecture" advancing craft and metaphor); varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful repetition (descend/ascend) taught early; zero loops, no figurative muddle in peak crane-folding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-gem cranes transforms grief tropes via floating isle logic and shadow mechanics; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens paradox stakes; basilica/crane reprise inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
