<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions like "volcanic tenderness rising in her throat" during discovery; motivation roots in promise to Kiran, compelling higher-stakes documentation with grief cost. Micro-choices like photographing symbols reveal values under pressure. Final weeping beside portrait earns closure renunciation of erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of carved panels to tapestry to portrait builds to CR closure ("She began the long climb back to daylight, carrying proof"). Orientation anchors early; no debt. Cost legible in "delayed grief" and institutional exposure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Basalt archive with "wall after wall of carved narratives" constrains trail-following choices; headlamp and dry air charge tactile discoveries. Final palm on portrait integrates setting into charged image, mirroring internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue Tethani proof/promise) signaled early, deepens via portrait vandalism revealing conspirators; density reweights with agency in piecing message. Cost unmistakable in embodied grief ("wept with the fierce tenderness").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of art-defying erasure emerges organically from trail discoveries to "promises burn too bright"; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from vandalized portrait's survival charges conceptual cost to silencers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual bias: analytical eye links "geometric patterns that became faces." Rhythmic prose modulates from analytical to tender ("volcanic tenderness"); no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences like "She knew this weaving pattern—had memorized it from the only photo" multi-task. No loops/artifacts; rhythm varies, climax breathes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-conservator uncovering art-trail in lost archive transforms erasure trope; risk in "fires had been necessary" heightens stakes organically to CR payoff.</comment>
