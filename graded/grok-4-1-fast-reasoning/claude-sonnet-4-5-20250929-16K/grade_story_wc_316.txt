<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kenji's dissociation cracks in the courtroom speech ("felt the tremor of fear and hope"), earning the brotherhood choice through embodied contradiction and prior micro-choices under Yoon's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dojo lesson deepens to courtroom RR (withdrawal as Charged Poise), cost legible in tears and "scars"; two-shard structure transitions cleanly with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating sanctuaries as "anchored" memory constrain choice (trusted reality amid rewriting) and charge final image of "floating court" where men vivify humanity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness vs. custody) deepens accumulatively via Yoon's form to agency in withdrawal, narrowing to brotherhood trade-off with felt emotional cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("two men who shared everything except their scars") reweights complements paradox non-literally, emerging organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable Kenji-limited POV with perceptual bias (distant observation thawing); dialogue subtextual (Yoon's "sliced through pretense"), distinct idioms under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in "grief and joy braided together"; minor register steadiness prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloning/ego death into complements paradox transforms immortality trope, risking philosophical sci-fi with hindsight inevitability in brotherhood pivot.</comment>
