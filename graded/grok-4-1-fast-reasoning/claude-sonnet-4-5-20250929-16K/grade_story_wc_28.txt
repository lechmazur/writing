<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between justice and mercy act simultaneously through retrocognitive visions and final prizing of the tessera; choice earned by prior augmentations and combat record. Internal voice particular to "gentle radical." Final renunciation forecloses exposure path with embodied cost in "another weight in her steel hands."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of visions and reflections builds to Conceptual Repricing closure when Vessa pockets tessera, reweighting hero myth with cost ("truth would stay with her"). Orientation anchored early in plaza; single scene holds. Cost legible in final burden image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shattered sky and mosaic constrain retrocog access and mirror mercy choice, charging final harmony image. Sensory details (warm coldness of metal on stone) selective via POV augmentations. Environment evolves to parallel reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose vs. mercy) signaled early via Council vote; Accumulative lens escalation via vision density forces stance crystallization. Agency in tessera act forecloses justice with felt cost ("burden of being gentle"). No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges from fractured sky/stones mirroring flawed heroism, reweighted non-literally in plaza's "wounded space." Final image offers resonant answer to justice query without moralizing. Complexity embraces flawed redemption without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature via steel hands and retrocog ("memory played through her fingertips"). Prose rhythm modulates tension; diction biased to empathy (sparrow's egg). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short hums amid longer revelations). Minor reflection density borders BRR but anchors to present cues like tessera. Slight overwriting in sky metaphors, but coherent and closure-charged; no loops or artifacts dull ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocog curse enabling mercy calculus transforms hero trope. Risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes via Davos irony. Non-obvious "aberrant mercy" angle feels inevitable from augmentations.</comment>
