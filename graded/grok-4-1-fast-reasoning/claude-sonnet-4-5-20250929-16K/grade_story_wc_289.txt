<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei Lin's motivation as keeper evolves through contradictory impulses—hoarding letters versus releasing them—culminating in an earned renunciation with visible cost when she empties her satchel. Interiority is embodied in her "weathered satchel" and hand movements "with certainty." Jun's secondary pressure via his own letter reinforces her arc without overshadowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm fragments accumulate density toward spiral's reconfiguration, with Mei Lin's release as Charged Poise closure bearing conceptual cost of non-possession. Single scene coheres without shards; orientation anchors in first paragraph (Mei Lin, temple, post-storm). No lens ambiguity; cost legible in her recognition "they were never mine to keep."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Temple and lily pond constrain choices via wet paths, threads, and prismatic light mirroring internal release; thrush nest as micro-setting charges final image when bird lands. Sensory details (dripping eaves, spinning fragments) filter through Mei Lin's priorities, evolving with action. 9+ gate met: recurring nest/object shapes tactics and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connecting truths via letters) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through Jun's revelation and visitors' responses, narrowing to release with felt cost in forfeited preservation. Agency in tying letters forecloses hoarding path; moral calculus of sacred vs. shared sharpens peak. Escalation driven by her micro-choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of releasing secrets into connections emerges organically from spiral's fragments and visitors' reunions, reweighting hoarding premise in final image of thrush and bells without moralizing. Subtext in silences (Jun's pause) and implications invites ambiguity on loss. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic release; resonant non-literal answer in "trusting they would find their way home."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable to Mei Lin, with perceptual bias toward letters' "aches"; voice modulates rhythmically from quiet observation to charged poise. Dialogue subtextual—Jun's "I need to write the next one myself" advances stakes naturally, distinct idiom from narration. Perceptual signature in prismatic motifs; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences like "words scattering prismatic reflections" layer image/atmosphere/action without loops or scaffolds. Rhythmic variety peaks in bells' "thousand crystalline notes"; zero artifacts, figurative coherence in nest/lotus motifs. Read-aloud ear flawless; no overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-conjured nest from letters transforms trope of unsent words into whimsical public communion, risking lyric accumulation that heightens stakes via irreplaceable spiral. Non-obvious angle on secrets as connective threads feels inevitable in thrush landing. Bold tonal risk in prismatic quiet pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
