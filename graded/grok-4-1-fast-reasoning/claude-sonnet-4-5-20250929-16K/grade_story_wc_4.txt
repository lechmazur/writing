<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as puzzle archivist drives concrete micro-choices like arranging photos into arcs, revealing character through embodied hands "know[ing] the grammar of grief." Thomas applies relational pressure, forcing communal shift. Minor therapy-speak in "collective healing" slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo arrangement builds density, people arrive as pattern break, closure via Charged Poise in group planning and Mira's satisfied departure reconfigures pain into shared grace with felt cost of non-erasure. Orientation anchored early ("lavender field...behind...textile factory"). No slips touch closure image of "voices rising...like birdsong."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (lavender swaying, scent persisting; vines climbing rusted walls) mirrors grief arcs and constrains arranging on ground. Factory ruins and field charge final image, evolving causally to dusk. Recurring lavender reweights abandonment into bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting pain) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Thomas's arrival then group gathering, narrowing to collective decisions with visible cost in rearranged (not erased) sorrow. Agency in Mira's adjustments catalyzes; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared pain-into-pattern emerges organically from arcs motif shifting to communal plans; final image of "lavender...sweet and persistent" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Explicit "collective healing" line creates minor echo, but complexity lingers in grace over erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (archiving "fragments...of feeling"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from calm arranging to charged dusk. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It's everyone's pain"), distinct from narration. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; metaphors consistent (arcs echoing windows/stems) without muddle in peak communal beat. No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting; final line "rearranged into grace" recharges motifs crisply.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Puzzle archivist premise fresh synthesis of grief lit via photo-arcs; transforms abandonment tropes through specific tactile arranging and communal catalysis. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
