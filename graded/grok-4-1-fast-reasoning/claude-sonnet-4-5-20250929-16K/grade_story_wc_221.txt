<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied sketching hesitation transforming to steady hand, with contradictory isolation/exploration impulses acting in scene; final endurance earned by family anchor and pariah defiance, foreclosing evacuation path with timeline cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sketches build patterns resolving chaos; on-page CR closure in final sketch reconfigures true north with undeniable isolation cost, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Compass rose and deck constrain orientation amid cosmic rush, charging final supernova reflection; selective sensory chaos mirrors Kira's shift, with micro-object reprise elevating to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to map unmappable tightens accumulatively via pattern emergence, narrowing isolation options; agency in persistent sketching forces trade-off of diverged timeline, legible cost in anniversary divergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity as navigation emerges organically from sketches/compass/family custom; final image non-literally reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with cosmic-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates from echoed silence to defiant concentration, compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion weaves cosmic images into action, zero figurative muddle in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation isolation via sketching tradition transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
