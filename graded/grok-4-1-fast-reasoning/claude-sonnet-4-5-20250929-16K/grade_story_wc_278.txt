<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—seeking her own cry while realizing her mother's guilt—act in scene via amber insertion and self-tattoo, earning the final renunciation with embodied cost in chest dissonance easing. Interiority particular through sound/frequency obsessions; flaws like untranslatability drive inevitable mapping struggles. No diagnostic speak; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density spirals via firmware outputs, letters, frequencies to CR closure in tattoo/final image reweighting guilt premise with silence cost. Orientation anchored by para 1; no shards/transitions needed. Phantom "Mother, tether me" to raw cry causal buildup narrows to integration; cost legible in empty pendant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lab shelves/equipment, mahogany desk constrain choices (hidden drawer, workspace); amber/firefly charges final tattoo image. Sensory hush (meteor hush, susurration) selective via Mira's frequency bias. Details tactile/lived (ink-stained fingers, dust-mixed pigment); no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt dissonance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via letter revelations/firmware cry to agency in amber port insertion/self-tattoo foreclosing running path. Cost unmistakable in dissonance ease post-tattoo; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness via listening across time-folds) emerges implicitly from frequencies/letters/spiraling constellation; final empty pendant/silence offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting abandonment premise without moralizing. Subtext in phantom cries shifts via particulars; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (stars/sounds as maps/voices); rhythmic diction modulates from hush to blaze to silence without head-hopping. Prose texture reflects Mira's translator mind; no elision issues. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density/propulsion; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/templates/paraphrase churn. Figurative density (nebulae ink, time folding) purposeful/patterned without muddle in peak tattoo beat. Minor metaphor stack in opening but no closure harm; syntax supports emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooist mapping lost sound frequencies/time-folded self-letters transforms tropes organically; self-tattoo turn inevitable from prior star-mapping constraint. Bold conceit (firmware voicing guilt across years) heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
