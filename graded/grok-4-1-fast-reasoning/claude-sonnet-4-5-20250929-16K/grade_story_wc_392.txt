<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in "hands shake even as she maintained her watchfully calm exterior," earning endurance against Chen's pressure; interiority particular via inherited memories tilting present choices; minor diagnostic phrasing like "fortified vulnerability" slightly genericizes peak resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as evidence density builds knowledge, delivering Charged Poise/CR closure in "lantern's flame held steady... ready to let her findings reverberate" with legible career cost; orientation anchored in para 1; single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tunnel's acoustics form "symphony of persistence," mirroring internal resolve and constraining documentation; lantern as micro-setting charges final image; sensory selection (drips, silt prints) POV-filtered via empirical priorities, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. career control) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fiber/boot print discoveries narrowing options to "unshakeable case"; agency in persistent documenting despite tremor forecloses compliance path with felt exposure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-liberation emerges organically from lantern legacy, evidence accumulation, and memory entanglement, resonating non-literally in final emergence image reweighting resistance; avoids moralizing, embraces ambiguity of inherited courage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of empirical observation filters all notice (e.g., "scratches... told a story of desperation"); stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under stress; purposeful repetition of "reverberate" taught early as textural motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "fabric fibers caught in the panel's hinges—wrong color" advancing multiple jobs; minor paraphrase loops in memory echoes ("entangled memories... fragments that felt older") but purposeful; rhythm varies, no template cadence dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whistleblower investigator inheriting Underground Railroad lantern/memories transforms corruption trope; final clarity on "threads in the same tapestry" feels inevitable from particulars, risking quiet rebellion over confrontation.</comment>
