<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and internal shift from mourning loss to new perception, earned through micro-choices like screw recognition; voice distinction clear in dialogue. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing ("healing was never in the oils") borders therapy-speak but ties to prior sensory loss without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with revelations tightening via screw reveal and grandmother's history, landing CR closure in final image of clock's reweighted burden with felt cost of transformed mourning. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog, gears, verdigris, and occluded views constrain revelation beat and charge final lifting fog image mirroring realization; sensory hierarchy reflects Elena's anosmia bias. Micro-setting of hanging tools guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unnamed purpose-seeking tightens accumulatively through shared backstories narrowing Elena's self-view; agency in attention forecloses disability narrative with cost legible in tears and reweighted clock carry. One deepening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of repurposed meaning emerges organically from tool parallels without moralizing; final CR image answers "how do you know when fixed?" non-literally via fog lift. Minor echo in closing lines but emergent from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (visual/emotional reads over smell); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., Mr. Chen's screw pause advances stakes. Lyrical rhythm modulates purposefully without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via water trickle image; no loops or scaffolds, figurative language (bells like rainfall) pattern-taught without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors but supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anosmia, midwife tools in clock shop, and perceptual shift transforms loss trope; risk in lyric fog motif heightens closure without gimmick. Organic, non-obvious parallels feel inevitable.</comment>
