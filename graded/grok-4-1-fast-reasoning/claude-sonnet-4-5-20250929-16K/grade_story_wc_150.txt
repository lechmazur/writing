<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's warmly curious trait drives concrete micro-choices like purposeful wandering over direct tomb path, revealing internal conflict between hollowed exile and rooted pull; final communal reburial earns her change with felt continuity cost. Priest applies secondary pressure, altering his stance without headcount blur. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract embodiment in mid-section.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wandering/discoveries build density to sundial inversion as CR closure, reweighting time/death with conceptual cost in final orchard image ("shadows of living branches marked time well enough"). Orientation anchored early (village/orchard/catacombs by para 2); one tightening via pear-root chamber find narrows to rebuilding rites. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb specifics (roots snaking skulls, pear like "wooden lightning") constrain excavation/wandering and charge final sundial image; sensory hierarchy (cool darkness, bone-rich earth) filters via Mira's curiosity. Setting evolves causally (sundial carried surface); micro-objects (rusted key, script) mirror inversion without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore rootedness via rites) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sundial discovery/deepening priest encounter, forcing communal crystallization; agency in rebuilding/reburial forecloses isolation path with visible cost (interrupted returns reconfigured). Moral calculus (faith as roots/bones vs. superstition) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (interruptions as transformations, life/death weaving) emerges organically from particulars like root-bone marriage and sundial inversion; final image offers non-literal resonant answer ("Faith didn't need to be what it was—it needed to grow"), reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in priest's whisper charges without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (sacred logic in grotesque); diction/rhythm modulate from exploratory ("purposeful wandering") to poised closure. Priest dialogue natural/subtextual ("roots and bones"); no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short epiphanic sentences peak at sundial script pulse, longer meditative in wandering). Propulsion weaves sensory/action without overwriting; opening anchors stakes, final recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sundial inversion (above-to-below time) synthesizes catacomb orchard ingeniously, transforming tropes (ancestral rites, returnee) via roots/bones logic; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
