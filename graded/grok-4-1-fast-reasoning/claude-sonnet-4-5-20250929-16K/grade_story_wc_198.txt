<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and micro-choices, like trembling hands on keys yielding to playing pauses, earn the endurance of new duty; contradictory fear and resolve act simultaneously without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via whisper emergence to resonant reconfiguration at "some silences...constant tending"; cost legible in foreclosed harbor routine and heavy saxophone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist, prism facets, and wet stone constrain sound/play and charge closure image; sensory hierarchy musical and mist-bound, mirroring internal hush without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to hush prophecy escalates accumulatively as whispers press gaps, forcing agency in "playing the pauses"; cost in ongoing duty reweights options unmistakably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of tended silence emerges from particulars like negative space notes, culminating in non-literal resonant answer via final walk; ambiguity lingers in vested power without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Musical perceptual signature ("notes that outlined emptiness") and rhythmic control modulate intensity seamlessly; stable close third-person with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and zero loops; "silence musical, gave it rhythm" passes read-aloud with purposeful figurative coherence in peak play beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical negative space hushing prophecy feels inevitable from prism setup; risk in conceptual hush transforms tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
