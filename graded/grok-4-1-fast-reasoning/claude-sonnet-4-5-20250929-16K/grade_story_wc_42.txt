<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's sage repairer traits drive contradictory impulses—honoring the clock's "escape" over forcing normalcy—culminating in earned restructuring with visible cost to traditional timekeeping. Interiority embodied via loupe, sounds, hands knowing "grammar of springs." Director Chen's pressure reveals her expertise without stereotypes. Final choice forecloses path of resistance, aligning with thematic renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from spinning hand's hum to seismic rhythm pattern, tightening to CR closure where leaf image reweights escape premise with conceptual cost of acceptance. Orientation anchored early (observatory, workbench, Moon). Single scene coherent, no shards. Cost legible in clock's pulsing forsaking steady time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Workbench tools, dome views constrain repair amid tremors rattling cups; clouds "like time itself" and Moon charge final image, mirroring instability. Sensory hierarchy: Mira notices rhythms over visuals. No white-room; spatial coherence in dome-to-window shift. Body/tool (loupes, dampener) enable pivotal restructure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sync clock for transit) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tremor intensification and clock's pattern break, narrowing to instability measurement over capture. Agency in repositioning gears forecloses steady-time option with cost to scientists' goals. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in pulsing hand. One tightening suffices, visible in shouted alarm beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral harnessing vs. acceptance emerges organically from clock's wild spin to pulsing instability, reweighted in final leaf-through-clouds image without moralizing. Subtext in Mira's correction: "measuring instability," contrasting Moon's constancy. Resonance from particulars (grooves, hairspring) avoids platitudes; counter-reading of futile capture lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: sound-biased noticing (hum beneath noise, leaf rhythm). Voice rhythmic, modulates from steady work to luminous final image. Dialogue subtextual—Chen's ache vs. Mira's insight—distinct idioms. No head-hopping; compression purposeful in repair beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "spinning hand moved so fast it hummed, a sound like wind through a paper forest" advances sound motif, atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; read-aloud flows. Figuratives coherent, pattern-taught (oceans, forests evoke flux). Zero scaffold in closure leaf image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clock as instability meter transforms escape velocity trope via repair logic, Moon constancy. Risk in lyric CR ending heightens stakes without gimmick. No templates; particulars (Geneva stops worn grooves) inevitable in hindsight. Bold perceptual bias on sound over sight.</comment>
