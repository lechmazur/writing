<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reverent trait and centuries-honed stillness compel the humming choice at climax, with embodied patience shown in waiting through dust; internal conflict subtle but present in balancing legacy against intervention. Final endurance of immobility forecloses frantic motion, earning the pulse's reconfiguration with her own calcified cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: arrowhead arrival seeds pattern, birds deepen density into hunter's interrupted chase, humming cadence-shifts to RR (Charged Poise) where pulse reconfigures via stillness, cost in her perpetual unmoving state felt in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain appraisal via resonance, charging closure as pulse rides reverberations; sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) reflects POV urgency, dust layers mirroring internal expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release frantic pulse) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via birds' scatter-regroup revealing death-pattern, forcing hummed intervention; agency in matching frequency forecloses loop with her stillness as felt cost, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stillness-as-navigation emerges from particulars (echo-folding prayers, calcified edges, pulse's circle vs expansion), final arrowhead's "quiet in a new way" reweights frantic pursuit non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (resonance over steps, echoes as words) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in humming beat, purposeful compression taught early via canyon reverb pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "hum, a frequency that matched... spread outward"), varied rhythm without loops; figurative consistency (prayers in rounds, resonance finding harmony) propels without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fantasy (consciousness via flint/echo/birds) transforms ghost-trap trope through skimmer's reverent stillness; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via canyon's memory-logic.</comment>
