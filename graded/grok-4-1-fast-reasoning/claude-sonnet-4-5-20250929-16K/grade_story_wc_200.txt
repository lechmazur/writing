<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation from daughter's loss compels micro-choices like wielding the tooth amid imperfect harp notes; contradictory fearlessness acts in descent and confrontation, earning endurance with cost of ongoing labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as distorted notes build density to ghost's release (RR/Charged Poise); closure cost legible in "dozens more souls" and fading echo, with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gorge's acoustics trap confessions, constraining pursuit "deeper into the gorge where shadows pooled"; recurring harp as micro-setting charges final "beautiful, broken truth."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake tightens via question evoking laughter, narrowing to tooth's intervention; agency forecloses guilt's loop with cost in integrated "yes, I failed... and yes, we laughed."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection healing emerges implicitly; final image "laughter threaded through tears, wrong notes made right" reweights grief/joy without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in "notes bent and wavering" mirrors emotional texture; rhythmic control heightens climax without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; density peaks in "laughter, sudden and surprised, bubbling up through decades of guilt," propelling via varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tooth's "remind them they once had teeth too" ingeniously transforms soul-collection trope; risk in lyric fantasy synthesis inevitable at ghost's glow.</comment>
