<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation to preserve culture drives micro-choices like inviting the violinist, with embodied dread tightening to lightening weight; violinist applies pressure via shared grief. Internal conflict subtle but consistent in rosewater dread amid practiced warmth. Final spark of purpose earned, foreclosing isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tour builds density of artifacts/memories to Charged Poise closure in bakery reflection, reweighting displacement via rising dough against waterfall roar. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (grotto, refugees). Cost legible in "eternal thunder" and unbroken grief sentences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like bioluminescent fungi and cave-grown grain constrain choices (bread adaptation); emerald lens charges final hope image, mirroring internal states. Sensory hierarchy via Celeste's museum gaze filters setting purposefully. Waterfall roar evolves to frame defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultural preservation signaled early, tightens accumulatively via violinist's thaw/weep narrowing to invitation with relational trade-off. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise, cost felt in shared unfinished grief and foreclosed forgetting. Protagonist agency in teaching offer crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defiant continuity emerges from particulars like initialed bread and aligned lens, reweighted in final dough-rising image against flood without moralizing. Subtext in silences/unfinished sentences invites ambiguity on erasure's edge. Protagonist arc inextricable from preservation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in artifact explanations; voice lyrical yet precise, modulating rhythm with emotional poise. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I haven't tasted such bread since..."), distinguishing violinist via whisper. No head-hopping, diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rosewater dread that perfumed everything now" advances emotion/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Metaphors purposeful (time "pooled like standing water"), coherent without muddle in closure beat. Propulsion aligns with accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh post-flood cultural remnant angle transforms tropes via museum irony and bread defiance; lens/opera glass synthesis particular/memorable. Risk in quiet Charged Poise ending heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates, full premise commitment.</comment>
