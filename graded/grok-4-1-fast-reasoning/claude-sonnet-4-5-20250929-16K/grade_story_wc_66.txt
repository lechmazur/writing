<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to embed stories intensifies through micro-choices like cloaking the radio glow during patrol, revealing contradictory risk-safety impulses. Interiority embodied in hand precision and dust observation under pressure. Final endurance earned with irony of performing for officials.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine copying to patrol tension and dust luminescence as CR closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (alcove, copyist, mist). Cost legible in persistent glow/risk: "its amber glow persisted in her memory like a promise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, dust constrain choices (mist cloaks patrol, dust confirms via glow). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (pen scratching, dial heartbeat). Final dust image charges closure, mirroring internal defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggling stories) signaled early, tightens via patrol approach forcing cloak (agency narrows options under Accumulative lens). Felt cost in leaked glow and ongoing hiding alters tactics to irony-laced compliance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories' persistence emerges organically from embedding lyrics and dust glowing brighter. Final image reconfigures premise: dust teaches mist, non-literal answer with conceptual cost of transformation/hiding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in glows/mist/dust biases. Rhythm modulates tension (short sentences at patrol). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm accelerates at patrol ("boots on cobblestones"). No loops, purposeful figuratives (thistled calm) enhance without muddle. Propulsion clear through action-image integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: story famine encoded in music/dust transforms dystopia tropes via luminous particles and lyric embedding. Risky calm tone heightens inevitability; closure inevitable from prior accumulation.</comment>
