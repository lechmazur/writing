<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's micro-choices like memorizing passenger routines and broadcasting names in sequence compel the climax, rooted in ardent persistence; embodied positivity contrasts three-year failure without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as radio patterns density-build to convergence; on-page DC/RR in timelines collapsing and hourglass filling carries conceptual cost of dispersed time, with one tightening via sand-passenger realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's bioluminescent constellations map routes and pulse to Marcus's broadcast, constraining navigation and charging climax; sensory details like sideways clocks and star-reflecting noon water filter through his deckhand bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reuniting passengers escalates via pattern realization narrowing to precise broadcast under accumulative lens; agency in voice-weaving forecloses failure path with felt three-year endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of dispersion/rewoven patterns emerges implicitly via hourglass and radio harmonies; final image of Marcus turning full hourglass offers non-literal resonant answer to fractured time, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with Marcus's perceptual signature in sensing currents and pattern harmonies; voice modulates rhythmically, diction like "permanently docked yet perpetually in transit" suits resilient lens without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with sentences multi-tasking action/atmosphere, varied rhythm accelerates to shuddering ferry; no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "limestone constellations" enhance without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of ferry as timeline nexus and sand-as-passengers transforms vanishing trope organically; bold risk in pattern-merging via routines feels inevitable, heightening stakes through Marcus's mapping.</comment>
