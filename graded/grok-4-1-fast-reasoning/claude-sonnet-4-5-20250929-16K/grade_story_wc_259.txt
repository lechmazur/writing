<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (anguished joy in trembling hands and tears) act simultaneously during console interaction; final renunciation earned by memory flood without unearned epiphany. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("end of innocence") embodied enough not to flaw climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via memory fragments culminating in CR closure: withdrawal from console reweights preservation premise with innocence cost legible in "her innocence gone but her humanity intact." Orientation anchored in opening lines; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bronze facets and preservation hum constrain interaction (entrance "breath," console coolness) and charge final image as pagoda dims, mirroring thematic impermanence. Sensory hierarchy (refracting colors hurting to witness) reflects historian's biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access forbidden knowledge) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through atom fragments narrowing to renunciation; agency in patternless drift forecloses preservation path with cost in unrecorded exit. Climax realization forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-as-poison emerges implicitly from atom visions (child laughing to archived death); final walking away offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral statement. No tidy binaries, ambiguity in bittersweet close lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (historical lens on "colors that had no names"); rhythmic modulation heightens immersion in memory flood without slippage. Elevated diction fits anguished poetic voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "steadily unpredictable" motif repetition teaching pattern; minor paraphrase in reflection blocks ("preservation itself could be poison") but no loops dulling closure image of dimming pagoda.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-crystals leading to civilizational stasis transforms trope organically; risk in lyric atom visions heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via final non-preservation.</comment>
