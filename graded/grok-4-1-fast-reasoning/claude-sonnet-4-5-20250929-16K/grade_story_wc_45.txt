<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory skepticism and curiosity act simultaneously when she kneels and touches bones, earning her final healing choice with visible cost to old certainty. Thomas's shrewd innocence constrains his plea authentically. Flawless interior embodiment without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens (Hybrid dominant at end) holds: revelations deepen from substitute body to bone map to glowing gate. On-page DC/RR closure as Thomas steps in, reconfiguring worlds with Maren's certainty cost legible in "chasm" image. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden's crystalline flowers and twilight constrain revelation space, mirroring Maren's cleft via bioluminescent stars; charges final blooming image. Sensory hierarchy medical: bones symmetrical, tooth opalescent. Spatial coherence perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve displacements) signaled early, deepens via bone exam narrowing paths; agency in rearranging forecloses skepticism with certainty cost. Lens escalation: density reweights via memories added. One tightening sufficient, charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (mercy in strangeness) emerges from particulars: mistakes as map, final garden bloom reweights premise non-literally as "healing on reality." No moralizing; ambiguity in dual Thomases lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with medical perceptual signature: bones as X-ray. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("fix broken things"); voices distinct (child harmonics vs. careful adult). Rhythmic control under revelation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in bone-arranging ("arranging and rearranging"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful ("egg" crack), no muddle in peak. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope via bone constellations and medical cosmic setting; inevitable hindsight from skeptic's hands. Bold risk in magical bone map heightens stakes organically.</comment>
