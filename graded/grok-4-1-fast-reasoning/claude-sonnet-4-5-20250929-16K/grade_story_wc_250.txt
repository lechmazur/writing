<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's embodied guilt ("half-spoken secret lodged in her throat like a stone") shows contradictory impulses via hesitation amid patterns mirroring her state; confession as micro-choice forecloses silence with relational cost (mother's eyes, brother's rescue). Guardian's silence and gestures reveal traits without exposition. Final commitment to patterns earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirror patterns accumulate density to reconfigure Mara's silence into speech, with CR closure in her placing the mirror and learning patterns—cost legible in overcome fear and new vigil burden. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via stars' emergence narrows options to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt dock's glistening surface and canal constrain light play, charging final image where open shutters make "dark water navigable." Sensory selectivity (light/shadow on water) reflects Mara's perceptual shift from confusion to understanding; recurring pilings/ropes ground spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unvoiced guilt risking family loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via patterns embodying her turmoil, forcing confession that forecloses secrecy with on-page cost (voice fracturing, run to harbor). Agency in speaking coordinates; brother's rescue confirms price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth as guiding stars emerges from light patterns shifting from guilt's angles to constellations, reweighting darkness via Mara's arc; final image of her mirror on dock offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in ongoing vigil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV via Mara's biased noticing ("patterns seemed random until... she felt"); lyrical diction ("cobalt dock glistened... scattered coins") modulates with intensity, distinct from sparse dialogue. Perceptual signature in light-as-language builds to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light and dark danced... silent empathy moved through the geometry"); rhythmic variety in short confession beats vs. flowing patterns, no loops. Minor figural density in opening risks overwrite but patterns pay off cohesively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dental mirror as semaphore for silent empathy transforms guardian trope; shutters-as-constellations reweights light/dark premise organically, with risk in wordless causality heightening stakes to inevitable Mara's inheritance.</comment>
