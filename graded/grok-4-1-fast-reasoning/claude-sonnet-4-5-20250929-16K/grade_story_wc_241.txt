<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in concrete details like notebook scrawls mapping emotions ("Expected Feeling of Aliveness: Incalculable"), revealing contradictory impulses between rebellion and embrace of math; final syllabus draft earns change with felt cost of father's damage. Flawless under pressure, no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via reflective density building to Conceptual Repricing closure: syllabus draft and phone message reweight understanding with undeniable cost of damaged neurons. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (library desk, rain, heart attack); single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain as percussion on skylights and clover prisms charge final image, mirroring internal thaw from rain easing; mica lantern constrains thinking beat by providing "soft, inadequate" light that enables insight. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (watercolor abstraction reflects probabilistic mind).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling contradictions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through notebook interpretation to agency in syllabus draft; cost legible in "rewiring his thoughts through damaged neurons." Minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-behavior gap emerges implicitly via scrawls ("knowing Doesn't Change Behavior") and final image reprices premise: math "might help them understand what needed saving," resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (probabilistic lens: "probability tree branched into... emotions") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from steady rain to "small sad curve," stable close third-person with no leakage. Prose as character reflects analytical mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "messages carved by a prisoner who was simultaneously his own jailer" advances character/theme/action); zero loops, varied rhythm, metaphors coherent and purposeful—no overwriting in peak reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of casino-gambler professor via notebooks as "psychological cartography"; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes on uncertainty without gimmick, inevitable hindsight via scrawl evolution.</comment>
