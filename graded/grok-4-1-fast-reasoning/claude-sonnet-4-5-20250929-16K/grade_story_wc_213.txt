<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses peaking when her hand hovers over the siren switch before rejecting it for the rope. Final renunciation of sirens is earned by prior discoveries, foreclosing mechanical reliability with the cost of personal risk. Flawless single-POV execution under pressure reveals her hierarchy of values through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: microclimate tracking causes rope discovery, causes imminent prediction, causes rope-ringing choice (Decisive Change) averting catastrophe. Closure reconfigures warnings via Charged Poise in final rope touch and priest's concession, with legible cost in storm's fury survived. Orientation anchors by para 2; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cloud-anchored cathedral, arches, and rope constrain choices (e.g., sealing eastern arches from below-storm). Sensory details (rope tremble, air shimmer) filter through Mira's attuned perception, evolving with storm. Micro-setting via rope-as-antenna charges final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (precise zero-hour warning) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven realization of inversion, narrowing to rope vs. siren with trade-off cost (panic risk). Escalation causal under lens culminates in stance crystallization, reweighting options with on-page survival price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from rope vs. siren choice, priest's final line offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Final image reweights mechanical presumption via ancient rhythm's success. Complexity lingers in priest's quiet concession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in vibrational sensitivity; voice modulates rhythmically from hush to fury. Sparse dialogue natural, priest's line goal-driven and subtextual. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits humble tester.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring tension (short pulls in climax); zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Opening anchors stakes, final line recharges rope motif crisply. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating cathedral and rope-antenna premise synthesizes fresh world-logic transforming storm-warning trope. Risky ancient-vs-tech calculus heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via vibration causality. No derivatives; bold synthesis commits fully.</comment>
