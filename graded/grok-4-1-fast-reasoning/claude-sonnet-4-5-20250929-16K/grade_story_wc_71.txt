<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to notice and document intensifies credibly to participatory reverence, with concrete interiority tied to grandmother's shop enabling the orris root recognition; micro-choice of placing the shard reveals values under emerging house pressure. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing ("hushed blaze") borders unearned but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations density-build to CR closure ("creeping memory" reweights premise) with conceptual cost legible in "fire that consumed her old assumptions" line. Orientation anchored early (bay walk, Ashford house); single scene tightens once meaningfully via shard placement triggering house exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (lilac/salt air, singing floorboards, silver water) filter through Maya's perceptual bias toward displacements, constraining her progression room-to-room; orris root as micro-setting charges final image by perfect fit on sill.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding displacements) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern recognition (original 1923 layout) narrowing to house's self-remembrance; agency in shard placement and return decision forecloses observer role with felt cost of assumption loss, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restoration/memory emerges organically from displacements and orris fit, culminating in resonant CR ("some houses... become themselves again") reweighting prior observations without moralizing; final porch image answers "wrong thing" realization non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, with perceptual signature (noticing "imperceptible shifts," object energies) modulating rhythmically; purposeful poetic compression ("bay held its breath") taught early, legible at closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "windows watched her" advances atmosphere/character); figurative pattern consistent/voice-motivated without muddle or loops, though mild density in realization beat ("hushed blaze") nicks propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms haunted-house trope into patient self-archaeology via displacements and orris cure-time parallel; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens conceptual stakes, with house's "grammar" turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
