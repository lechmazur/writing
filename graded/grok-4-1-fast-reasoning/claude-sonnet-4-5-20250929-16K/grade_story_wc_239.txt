<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between detached observation and embodied integration culminates in earned realization at "He had always been walking home"; minor abstraction in embodied emotion prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("the greatest cosmic illusion was separation") charged by dictionary image and felt cost of unified perception; orientation anchored early, pattern taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library's spiral architecture constrains inward/outward journey and charges final translucent walls image; selective sensory hush and stone shelves mirror dissolution without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel illusions) deepens accumulatively via dictionary pivots to foreclose separation stance with conceptual cost legible in final breath; single tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emergent theme of synthesis via spiral unification reweights fragments in closing libraries image without moralizing; resonance from particulars like dictionary placements avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of spiraling syntax and biased noticing (illusions over solidity); rhythmic modulation heightens revelation without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful spiral recurrences propels via varied rhythm; minor paraphrase echoes in reflection beats but no closure touch or loops dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library as consciousness fold transforms simulation/maya tropes through dictionary's precision; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at unified center.</comment>
