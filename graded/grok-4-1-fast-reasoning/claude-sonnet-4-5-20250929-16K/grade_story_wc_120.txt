<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied homesickness via shell imprint and racing exhaustion compelling higher-stakes writing; contradictory impulses surface in productive ache for childhood. Final realization—"chronological homesickness was itself a fortune"—earns change with cost of fleeting dawn. No stock phrasing; flaws like exhaustion drive inevitable limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to CR closure where symmetry dissolves and she rests, reweighting homesickness into hope with exhaustion cost legible in "exhaustion finally hit." Orientation anchored early (spire, lake, dawn). Single scene coherent; no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass spire and frozen lake constrain dawn window and charge final image ("spire stood silent"); mirrored horizon evolves causally from gray-to-gold, mirroring internal suspension. Sensory selection (light prism, shell grooves) POV-biased toward memory. Micro-setting (nautilus drawer) integrates tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fortunes before exhaustion) signaled early, tightens via "racing the exhaustion, racing the sun's full emergence" under accumulative lens, narrowing options with felt cost. Agency in memory-mapping yields output; no reversals needed. Price alters tactics: faster writing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of spiral time and symphonies emerges organically from shell/memories/fortunes; final image ("nautilus...chambered memory") offers resonant CR repricing homesickness as instrument without moral. Subtext in "unheard symphonies" charges closure. No platitudes; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, with perceptual signature (mapping memories precisely: "creak...cardamom...blue"). Rhythm modulates from hush to race; diction purposeful ("honey," "prism"). No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud (short raced sentences peak); high density integrates image/action ("pressed...to her temple"). Minor horizon repetition purposeful pattern; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures touch closure. Propulsion clear to final hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune-writing as memory archaeology in spire transforms tropes; "chronologically homesick" inflects uniquely. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via shell-spire-horizon motif charging closure.</comment>
