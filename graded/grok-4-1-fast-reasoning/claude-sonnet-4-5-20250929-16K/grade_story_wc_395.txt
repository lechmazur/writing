<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brother's patch roots motivation in personal loss, earning the final extraction commitment with embodied fingers-on-patch tactility; contradictory impulses subtle but present in lying vs. preserving role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (disappearances to 2347 coordinates) tightens to null-state discovery and Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "even if it cost her everything" as she opens terminal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cubicle/archive micro-setting and patch object constrain choices (backdoors accessed, patch as map); sensory selection (frayed edges, pulsing numbers) filters through data-keeper bias, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve trapped consciousnesses) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern deepening to extraction agency; on-page cost forecloses safe corporate role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Preservation-vs-erasure theme emerges organically from digital graves and astronaut echoes, resonant CR in final protocol-writing reweighting "forgotten songs finally finding their voice."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (absence-sensing, "brightly attentive" diction) with rhythmic modulation under pressure; purposeful poetic compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propulsion with zero loops or scaffolds; vivid rhythm varies (short punchy sentences at peak: "She began writing"), no figurative muddle in closure beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh digital-purgatory synthesis via archive ghosts and .2347 signals transforms trope of missing persons; risk-taking in accumulative pattern inevitability heightens closure stakes.</comment>
