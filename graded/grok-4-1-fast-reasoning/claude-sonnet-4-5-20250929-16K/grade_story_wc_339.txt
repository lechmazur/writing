<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—comfort in death's shadow versus borrowed-time descents—act simultaneously in micro-choices like precise cylinder collection, earning the final endurance with embodied cost in trembling hands at the log.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density (cylinders to log to globe), culminating in CR closure where Marsh's note ("patterns... our attention") reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of surrender; orientation anchored early in descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Snow globe as recurring micro-setting constrains securement and charges final image (shaken swirl mirroring transformation); selective sensory details like "barnacled spine" and "artificial snow suspended" filter through analytic POV without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmission's physics) tightens accumulatively via log discovery, forcing stance crystallization in globe-shake; cost legible in foreclosed untangling, charging final poise though agency leans observational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final snow-globe image offers non-literal resonant answer to "threads of attachment," reweighting Eleanor's equations through Marsh's transformation insight without moralizing; theme emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of analytic melancholy (e.g., "geometric avalanches"); rhythmic control modulates from precise to swirling introspection, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in lines like "brass cylinders... dropped cigarettes" propels via varied syntax; rhythm breathes with scene, no figurative muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart-era wreck as grief-physics quest transforms tropes; snow-globe payoff risks lyric closure effectively, though historical frame borders familiar without full subversion.</comment>
