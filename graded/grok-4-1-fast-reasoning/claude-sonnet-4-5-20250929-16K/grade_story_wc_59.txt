<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince's motivation rooted in desperation for beauty drives micro-choices like trading sword and weeping over cells; embodied tears and quaking reverie show contradictory hope/despair acting simultaneously; final admission to father earns change with cost of admitting flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from egg handling to day-43 hatching as RR/Charged Poise, reconfiguring world with "heartbeat" at cost of imperfection; orientation anchored early in palace-stalactite climb; single tightening via movement suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via precarious lab and swaying palace mirroring internal fragility; crystal walls frame final image where "cavern's darkness seemed less absolute," charging closure; sensory selection (clicking servants, steam) purposeful and POV-biased toward lost organic life.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to emergence forcing acceptance of flaw; agency in persistent hypothesizing forecloses pure revival; cost legible in "flawed... but dreams" and tasted "salt and hope."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of broken beginnings yielding wonder emerges organically from egg-to-hybrid arc; final image non-literally answers mechanical sterility with singing hybrid, reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity in "flawed" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person voice stable with perceptual signature (hypothesizing lens on organic fragments); diction/rhythm modulates from trembling setup to reverie crescendo; brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden in father's "What have you made?" pursuing judgment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing texture (e.g., "filaments like fiber optics"); varied rhythm propels from setup to peak song; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; closure image crisp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk stasis and biotech resurrection yields inevitable hybrid wonder; risk in flawed genesis transforms trope of mad science into poignant hope; final "salt and hope" inflects uniquely without gimmick.</comment>
