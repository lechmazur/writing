<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scarred hands as "topography of trauma" and final choice to "choose it knowingly" earn internal change with embodied cost; motivation from father's legacy compels endurance without tidy epiphany. Minor therapy-speak in "pain journals" contained and anchored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density tightens to CR closure in box placement and "bargain continues" realization with scar-cost reweighting; orientation anchored early in ridge walk, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge and Douglas fir constrain closure act; scarred fingers on porcelain integrate body/setting to charge final image of scars catching light. Sensory selectivity (silver light on fractures) mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating father's pain signaled early, deepens accumulatively through journal entries to foreclose ignorance with endurance cost in continued firefighting; agency in reflection and writing narrows options legible at ridge end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bargained innocence emerges from father's scapegoat and Marcus's scars without statement; final image of scars as "syntax of survival" reweights sacrifice theme non-literally with grace-cost resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (fire-scarred lens on light/words) with rhythmic modulation; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "lightning frozen in clay" propelling rhythm; minor overwrite in repeated "trading" motifs purposeful but borders loop in reflective beats, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh porcelain pain-language synthesis transforms firefighter trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens scar/grief stakes organically to inevitable CR without derivative hedging.</comment>
