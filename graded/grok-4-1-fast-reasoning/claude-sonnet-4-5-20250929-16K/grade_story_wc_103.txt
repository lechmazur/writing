<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to discover time's texture drives micro-choices like entering the maze, embodied in trembling fingers and intensifying visions; interiority concrete via fractured perceptions. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("retrocognitively trapped") borders therapy abstraction but doesn't flatten peak agency. Final dissolution earned as reverent endurance with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions, fading photos, and geometry builds to CR closure where "Miriam dissolved with it... becoming part of the garden's memory" reweights reality with conceptual cost of dispersal. Orientation anchored early in garden/maze; one tightening via halo find narrows to center confrontation. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic maze constrains choices and charges final image as "lens" restructuring reality; living bridges and hedges tactile, POV-filtered through designer's eye. Sensory hierarchy narrows to heat/pulse in climax. Micro-setting (roots embedding halo) enables discovery without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture discovery) signaled early, escalates texturally via intensifying visions and unbecoming photos, forcing stance crystallization in dispersal. Agency in maze design/entry; cost legible as "her own edges beginning to disintegrate." Single deepening suffices, coherence to CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recursive time emerges organically from geometry/images, final CR image ("doorway between two mirrors") reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of infinite regress. No moralizing; ambiguity in reverence vs. loss lingers purposefully. Resonance from particulars like halo shatter loop.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in geometric idiom ("saddle-point surfaces," "infinite corridors"); diction modulates to compression in climax visions. No head-hopping; elisions (past bleeds) taught early, paid in CR. Prose texture distinct, rhythmic under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pathways that seemed to double back but actually spiraled"); rhythm varies, no loops beyond purposeful "saw... saw" pattern. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("scratched record of catastrophe") but coherent, no muddle at closure flare. Propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, retrocognition, and halo transforms time trope into inevitable CR; risk in dissolution payoff heightens stakes without gimmick. Maze as reality-lens feels non-obvious, organic to designer's traits.</comment>
