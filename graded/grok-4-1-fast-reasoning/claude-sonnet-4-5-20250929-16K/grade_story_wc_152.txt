<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—giggling fool masking wise listener—act in scene via cookie offers and embroidery, earning her final choice to warn the guard with visible cost to her cover. Grandmother's teaching roots her consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes listening. No unearned epiphanies; interiority concrete and embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in "Before the coup" crystallization and new stitching plan, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of acting disguised. Orientation anchored early in observatory. One tightening via pattern connections suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eternal flame constrains choice by revealing reverse pattern when "She held her embroidery up to the eternal flame," charging final image. Sensory details selective via Mira's priorities; autumn observatory vivid, lived-in, mirroring internal threads. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover conspiracy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through connected pieces to coup realization, narrowing options with agency in decision to act subtly. Cost legible in risked cover; one deepening via "synchronize" pattern coheres pressure. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-tightening withholds 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden patterns emerges organically via threads/silences, resonant non-literal answer in final stitching convergence reweighting fool/wise binary without moral. Complexity lingers in adjacent possibilities; irony from scholars' blindness earned. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in embroidery metaphors and thread diction; rhythmic control modulates from calm observation to charged realization. POV stable, close third-limited; no head-hopping or withholding. Prose texture reflects Mira's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies with scene (e.g., short punches in "Before the coup"). Metaphors consistent, purposeful without muddle; propulsion clear in image-driven sentences. Opening/final lines recharge motifs perfectly. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroiderer-spy via "wisdom disguised as foolishness" transforms trope; non-obvious coup via listened fragments feels inevitable. Boldly risks lyric accumulative structure heightening stakes; no derivatives.</comment>
