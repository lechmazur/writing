<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marin's warmly methodical traits compel the rebinding choice with embodied patience, earning the timeline merge; contradictory competence in impossible physics shows through steady fingers amid humming instability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through door manifestation to seal discovery therefore rebinding DC; closure costs felt in blazing rope and merged notebooks, with orientation anchored early in clock tower wait.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Impossible room's curving shelves and flickering boxes constrain careful movement, charging final stabilized documents; clock's tick-tick and warm seal embody POV's archivist priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timeline confusion tightens causally via seal's pattern narrowing to rope reconfiguration; agency in unbraiding forecloses split realities with hot-blazing cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Absence-to-presence theme emerges organically from fables and rope braids, reweighted in merged notebooks without statement; final tea-pouring image answers confusion/clarity non-literally with elegant structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of absence-noticing biases diction; rhythmic modulation peaks in "room hummed...flickering documents stabilized" without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in "fingers worked steadily, unbraiding and rebraiding" propels without loops; varied syntax breathes with scene rhythm, specific verbs over modifiers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Timeline merger via archival rope/seal synthesizes fresh impossibility physics; risk in absence-logic payoff feels inevitable from early door pattern.</comment>
