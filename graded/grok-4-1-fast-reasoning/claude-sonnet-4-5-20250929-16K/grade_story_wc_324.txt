<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's curiosity compels unauthorized record access despite risk, embodying flaw with shaking hands; contradictory drive from idle tracing to urgent intervention earns closure heroism, concretely felt in chest-tightening vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain—pulse to words to visions to records to precise police directive—delivers on-page DC with madness-risk cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single-scene defaults met, lens holds firmly to charged phone confirmation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium with leaning ferns and thickening mist constrains secretive work and mirrors urgency, lifting at closure to recharge living/dead boundary; selective sensory evolution charges final archive image without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trace/protect vulnerable pulse tightens via young voice, suicide flag, frantic signal forcing agency in record hack and pinpoint call; cost legible in shaking hands and skeptical authority, foreclosing passive curiosity path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Incidental heroism emerges organically from curiosity-meets-duty in pulses and photo reprise, reweighting boundaries without moralizing; final mist-lift and archived device offer resonant non-literal answer to protecting echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature biases toward electromagnetic grief signatures, with rhythmic modulation under stress; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in legible closure image, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image-charged rhythm, but minor figurative density in opening mist-breath risks slight overwrites without obscuring peak frantic-pulse beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh electromagnetic heart-tracing via old devices transforms ghost-story trope through specific hospital pulses and carnival photo synthesis; risk in "shouldn't access" records heightens stakes organically to inevitable heroism.</comment>
