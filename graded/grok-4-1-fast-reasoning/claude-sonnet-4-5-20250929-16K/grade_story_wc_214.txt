<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied empathy with falling stars; contradictory impulses (exile as penance vs. discovery) act in scene, earning final renunciation of brokenness. Final choice to carry glow internally shows hierarchy of values with cost of admitting cracks. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("cracks let the light through") avoids 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: meteor density and glass patterns deepen realization; orientation anchored immediately in station and ritual. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in glass insight and final note, reweighting vulnerability with emotional cost ("his own brief, burning journey"). Persistent lantern constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass as micro-setting constrains insight and charges final image; sensory details (amber glow, bubbles like stars) selective via POV bias, mirroring internal states through action. Station's weathered dome evolves with dawn, grounding cosmic scale tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (strength in vulnerability) signaled early, tightens via glass pattern deepening knowledge; attention as agency forecloses isolation path with felt cost in realization. Textural cadence shift with Perseids coheres pressure, but internal focus mutes visceral trade-off for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability's strength emerges organically from glass imperfections shifting meaning; final image ("carrying its glow inside") offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral. Particulars like meteor empathy avoid platitudes; earned via struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (cosmic rhythms, stellar sentences); psychic distance modulates elegantly from ritual to epiphany. Compression in meteor beats taught early, pays off in charged poise; no head-hopping, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "bubbles trapped inside like tiny stars suspended in honey" purposeful, no loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies (short meteor beats to reflective pauses), clear syntax; minor overwrites in descriptive peaks don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor premise transforms solitude trope via glass insight; fresh synthesis of abandonment and awe feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry, but familiar epiphany arc caps at 8.8.</comment>
