<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in embodied phobia (hating enclosed spaces yet climbing trellis) driving micro-choices like securing vines; final realization earned via collection's cost against father's bunkers. Interiority particular (silences' textures) with no stock phrasing. Flawless single-POV execution elevates to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to sprout discovery as tightening, yielding CR closure in doll's warmth reweighting phobia with conceptual cost (openness/enclosure coexist). Orientation anchored early (Lina/trellis/inversion). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (inversion hour) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Trellis constrains choices (securing loops, spilled water enables sprout); doll/body charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (silences over sight). Vivid, selective details (clouds below feet, gold-veined petals) mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gilded hush) signaled early; Accumulative deepening via sprout unfurling narrows options during inversion, forcing collection with felt heaviness cost on descent. Agency in limiting exposure/uncorking. One tightening sufficient, charges poise without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (bunkers vs. trellis/flower); final image (doll's warmth, descent reflection) offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing. Subtext in silences' textures invites ambiguity on compression/beauty. No tidy binaries; counter-reading (father's irony) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (silences as flavors/colors); rhythmic control modulates (short sensory bursts under inversion stress). Lyrical diction purposeful, biased noticing character-specific. No elision issues; prose as mind under textural pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (long reflective opens to punchy inversion beats). Metaphors coherent (hush as honey/light) without muddle, propel via specifics. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence-collection via doll transforms beanstalk/gravity tropes into textural quest; risk in intangibles (gilded hush) heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable flower-sprout turn feels inevitable from prior spill. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
