<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between neutron star "purity" and greenhouse "chaos" act simultaneously through observations; final renunciation of control ("letting gradual change write its patient story on her skin") earned by weeks of dust documentation with visible worldview cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup in dust patterns culminating in Conceptual Repricing closure via butterfly emergence and hand-dust image; felt cost of humility legible in final sentence; orientation anchored early in greenhouse post-flood.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust striations, sprouting tomatoes from joists, and crystallized salt constrain her tactile observations and charge final hand image; sensory details (crunching boots, vivid wing) selectively mirror scientific gaze without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling research control with chaotic transformation signaled early, escalates texturally via accumulated patterns to butterfly deepening that narrows her prior worldview; agency in persistent visits forecloses "preprocessing" path with humility cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of messy transformation over collapse emerges organically from neutron star/greenhouse contrasts; final dust-on-skin image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "purity" premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of pulsar-like pattern scrutiny; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in closing lines; purposeful compression of weeks' visits taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels accumulative texture; no loops or scaffolds; pivotal "teaspoon would weigh a billion tons" line deploys precise diction without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star density and greenhouse rebirth transforms tropes; risk in vignette structure heightens stakes of subtle realization, inevitable in hindsight via dust motif.</comment>
