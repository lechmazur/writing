<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alchemist's motivation to reject wishes and reimagine via memory feels rooted and intensifies to compel the forehead-pressing climax; interiority concrete through "mind's crucible." Minor lack of contradictory impulses in-scene limits from 9+; resolute endurance earns change with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from study to shattering; closure as CR lands on-page ("bottle began to crack, light seeping") with conceptual cost of transformation over restoration. Orientation anchored early in cove; one tightening via bottle's warmth suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Paper lanterns recur to constrain and charge final bloom image; sensory details (salt-worn air, tide pools) filter through alchemist's priorities, evolving causally. Setting guides choice to square; micro-objects like bottle integrate tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine town) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as memory pours into bottle, narrowing to transformation; agency in refusal and vision forecloses restoration path. Cost felt in solitude and effort legible at shattering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rejecting false comfort for reimagining emerges organically from particulars like town's history transmuted; final lanterns' inscription offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors like "distilled possibility"); rhythmic control modulates from meditative to charged climax. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to her expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "The bottle grew warm" advances plot/foreshadows); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors without muddle. Propulsion peaks cleanly at silent shatter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of djinn leavings into memory-alchemy for civilization seed; risk in abstract "working memory" pays off via concrete release, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
