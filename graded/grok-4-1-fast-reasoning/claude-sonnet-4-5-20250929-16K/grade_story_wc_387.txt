<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through net-mending and whisk study, revealing consistent motivation to see patterns; earned stasis in choosing ordinary effort over glory felt in final net-picking. Minor lack of overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from nets to fireflies to student anticipation; closure as Charged Poise/CR in final lines reconfigures philosophy with endurance cost ("cold stone"). Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via whisk-to-puddle flick suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (slick stone pools, firefly currents) filtered through POV's pattern-seeking bias constrain observation and charge final image; recurring nets/whisk as micro-setting evolve with action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening observations culminating in student prep; agency as endurance forecloses glory path with felt cost in final readiness. Subtle tightening lacks overt option-narrowing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges organically from particulars (nets, fireflies, whisk), reweighted in final image without moralizing; resonant CR answers philosophy-in-work question via "beautiful, hidden architecture of ordinary effort."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature (pattern-mapping gaze); rhythmic prose modulates serenely, compression purposeful for lyric mode, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful figurative language (e.g., "scintillatingly somber pools") taught early for textural lens; minor density of metaphors in reflective beats slightly dulls propulsion but no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending as philosophy, transforming tropes via whisk/firefly patterns; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of unseen labor without gimmickry.</comment>
