<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to defeat numbness roots deeply in embodied vibrations felt in her chest, driving concrete actions like cavern preparation; internal conflict emerges in recognizing her students' mirroring numbness. Students feel generic without distinct micro-choices, slightly diluting crucible pressure. Final endurance as guide earns change with cost of surface disconnection foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from needle discovery to backward playback success, culminating in CR closure where hush reconfigures emotion with breakage cost legible in "things must break apart to reveal what exists in the fracture." Orientation anchors early in cavern descent. One tightening via first vibration suffices; pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern constrains via hush-absorbing fabrics and stone vibrations that enable discovery; recurring needle charges final image as vital fracture. Sensory hierarchy vibration-dominant fits deaf POV bias perfectly. Atmosphere of mirrored hush tensions concept without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defeating numbness signaled early, deepens accumulatively through inverted songs narrowing emotional void; agency in preparation and student sessions forecloses numbness path. Cost felt in chest penetration and breakage metaphor. No reversal needed under lens; pressure coheres to pilgrimage Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emotion in pauses emerges implicitly via hush filament and backward patterns, reweighted in final needle image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like pulsing shadow ties to resurrection. Invites ambiguity of hush as presence, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with vibration-biased perceptual signature; voice modulates lyrically yet precisely, syntax reflecting hush architecture. Signing dialogue natural and goal-pursuing. No head-hopping; elision of sound taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, e.g., varying sentence openings propel from descent to climax without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful in "filament of hush," no muddle in peak playback beat. Propulsion breathes with scene, concrete over generic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf teacher inverting sound via backward phonograph in hush cavern transforms numbness trope into resonant hush-presence. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from needle fracture to pilgrimage.</comment>
