<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in nervousness over the bottle and philosophy of linking absences; endurance of respectfully rebellious role earned with visible cost in ongoing deliveries despite border hush. Micro-choices like pausing for drones reveal values under pressure. Mira applies relational pressure, forcing subtle status shift in shared knowledge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from walk-through to handoff realization; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in "evidence that people don't forget," reweighting borders with conceptual cost of enforced absence legible in bottle's flicker and final walk-on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's blue glass and defunct fountain constrain pauses and center meeting, charging final indigo fade; hush and twilight sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's priorities, mirroring internal tension without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (satchel, bottle) alters tactics via nervousness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver to heal promise) signaled early, tightens at handoff with deepening knowledge of girl's need; agency in endurance forecloses easy compliance, cost felt in father's irremediable absence revoiced through storm. Escalation via lens: pattern break in bottle's live thunder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing promises via linked absences emerges from bottle handoff and dialogue implications, resonant in final image of carrying on; no moralizing, ambiguity in borders' insistence lingers with counter-reading of futile rebellion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in oceanic shadows and hush-noted silences; dialogue natural/subtextual ("He never forgot"), advances stakes via shared weariness. Rhythm modulates from descriptive breath to terse exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short exchanges amid longer textured sentences; high density integrates setting into action, minor paraphrase loop in "brittle hush" (-0.3) but no closure touch. Zero filter stacks, propulsion clear to final blessing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of border mailman with weather-preserved storm transforms smuggling trope; thunderstorm bottle's birth-night specificity risks bold ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight as promise-healer, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
