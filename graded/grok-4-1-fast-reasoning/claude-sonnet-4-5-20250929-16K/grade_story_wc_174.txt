<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus's serenity amid stinging accusations shows contradictory impulses embodied in steady breathing and fluid puppetry; drunk's epiphany forces micro-choice to let show end unresolved, earning realization with relational cost to partner. Drunk applies targeted pressure as secondary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: performance density builds to drunk's pattern-breaking intervention ("the campfire stick somehow in his hands"), yielding CR closure in "Marcus understood then" where assumptions reweight with conceptual cost to prior certainties. Orientation anchored early in dome post-argument; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dome's curved walls echo accusations and enable meteor hush; campfire stick as micro-setting evolves from prop to epiphany catalyst, charging final image of frozen puppets. Sensory hierarchy (half-darkness fragments audience) reflects Marcus's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (validate ethical storytelling post-argument) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via drunk's "half-lit epiphany" narrowing options to unresolved quiet; agency in serene continuation forecloses tidy moral with felt cost in partner rift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of productive uncertainty emerges via puppet's "reverse a moral" question answered non-literally in audience murmurs and final "half-lit epiphanies like candles"; reweights prior partner conflict without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in "meteor hush" and half-darkness; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (drunk's slur-to-clarity advances plot). Rhythmic control modulates from fluid performance to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (stick "walking cane, then a weapon"); varied rhythm avoids loops, though "uncommonly serene" reprises twice purposefully echo trait. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puppet reversal ethics in rust-belt bars transforms trope of artist doubt; risk in drunk's hijacked stick heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
