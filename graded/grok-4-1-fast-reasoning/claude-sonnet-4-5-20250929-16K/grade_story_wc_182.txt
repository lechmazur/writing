<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's expertise as arcane linguist drives concrete choices like consulting the diary and speaking missing prepositions; traveler's recursive forgetting compels higher-stakes renegotiation. Internal conflict subtle in balancing mountain's grammar with rescue. Minor slip: archetypal competence slightly idealized without deeper flaw exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: disturbance accumulates via rift explanation and diary reading to linguistic bridge closure (RR/CR). On-page cost in traveler's forgetting reconfigures eternal seeking. Orientation anchored early in Codex Mountain; one tightening via overlapping visits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain's living shelves constrain navigation and respond to conjugations, charging final whispering image. Sensory details like humming spines and drifting voices mirror symphonic tone. Recurring sections guide choices without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rescue students from traveler's rift; deepening via 17-visit overlaps narrows to renegotiation under Accumulative lens. Agency in Mira's phrases + traveler's reading; cost felt in persistent forgetting charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-through-loss emerges via unlearned library and "remember to forget"; final image of Mira translating whispers reweights cycle non-literally. Subtext in silences and gaps avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with linguistic texture ("temporal prepositions—those strange verbal flowers") stable in Mira's POV; dialogue subtextual and distinct. Rhythm modulates from disturbance to resolution without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful botanical metaphors taught early, no loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels to climax. Minor figurative density in peak but coherent and payoff-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic magic in living mountain transforms time-travel tropes; unlearned library and symphonic gaps risk bold conceptual integrity. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
