<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism-minded trait effectively shown in noticing doodle and aligning symbols at climax, compelling higher-stakes navigation; interiority embodied via "lightness in her bones" and hair as "seaweed," rooting motivation in archive's decline. Minor weakness: minimal contradictory impulses, with singular drive limiting internal conflict depth before planting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of threshold discoveries building to hidden chamber; on-page closure as Resonant Reconfiguration when "she pressed the seeds into stone that had become soil," reweighting combinations with conceptual cost of archive preservation. Serpentine path causal chain tight, orientation anchored early in vault/grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inversion specifics ("water fell upward," "sediment rising like reverse rain") constrain choices and charge final image, with grotto's mist/echoes mirroring internal vigilance motif through tactile navigation. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered via archivist priorities; no white-room, spatial choreography coherent in coiling passages.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding combinations for seeds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via threshold pauses to chamber discovery, narrowing options under inversion pressure; agency in pulling through "second opening" forces trade-off with timing cost. One tightening sufficient, cost legible in effort during 60-minute window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten knowledge blooming via vigilance emerges organically from doodle-path-seeds arc, with final planting offering resonant non-literal answer (blooming in depths) reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like "stone that had become soil" avoid platitudes, embracing complexity of human memory's fade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in prism-like connections ("multiple interpretations collapsing"); stable close-third POV with biased noticing (botanical/symbolic details); rhythmic control modulates with inversion intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful images ("stone tears floated"), varying rhythm accelerates in passages; minor overwrite in metaphor density ("intestines of some ancient beast," "serpents in the mist") slightly muddles peak navigation without harming closure. No loops or scaffolds, strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inversion physics, threshold navigation, and botanical consciousness transforms tropes into inevitable arc; risk in liminal combos heightens stakes, with "reentering" turn grown from doodle pattern feeling ingenious and hindsight-earned.</comment>
