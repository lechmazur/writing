<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—haunted grief versus practical carving—act simultaneously in embodied micro-choices like pausing for tea; final endurance earned by Viktor-taming parallels, with cost of impermanence legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from blank to laugh-figure; Charged Poise closure in "carved meaning from absence" reconfigures grief with undeniable emotional cost on final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ash grain constrain carving strokes and mirror internal transience, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (rain drum, gray light) reflects Mira's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of containing Viktor via crystallized moments deepens accumulatively through carving persistence despite kettle interruptions; cost of loss forecloses containment, felt in ongoing absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from circus backstory to wood gestures; final "harvesting what only grief could teach" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in gestural precision (e.g., "angle of his chin"); rhythmic prose modulates carving intensity without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "first cut... curve of a spine"); varied syntax propels accumulatively, zero loops or scaffolds, metaphors cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystallized-time carving transforms widowhood trope via lion-taming specifics; reflective alchemy risks bold lyricism, inevitable in hindsight with closure payoff.</comment>
