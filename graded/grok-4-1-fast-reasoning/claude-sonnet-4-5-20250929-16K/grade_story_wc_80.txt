<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive interiority embodied in cataloging cracks as erasures and interlacing personal memory ("Sarah wore yellow") with technical notes; final choice to place note earned by prior losses, foreclosing mere measurement with conceptual cost of archival endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to CR closure in note placement and final image of inkwell warm in palm, reweighting surveyor role with undeniable conceptual cost of preserving temporal loss; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion and water constrain choices (wading to fissure) and charge final sacred light image; sensory details (shifting sunlight columns, salt air) filtered through professional bias, mirroring internal absence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve interlaced absence) signaled early, tightens via fissure discovery and note-wrestling that forecloses oblivion with felt physical cost ("wrestled it into the column's crack"); agency in micro-choices under textural lens, cost legible in temporary seal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence woven through pavilion's ruins, defunct programs, and note's contents emerges organically; final image of secured offering reconfigures preservation as quiet archeology with lingering ambiguity of future discovery, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in measuring negative spaces ("absence could be interlaced"); rhythmic diction modulates from stoic to hushed blaze, purposeful compression pays off in charged final palm warmth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("listing like drunken dancers"); zero loops, varied rhythm supports textural accumulation, metaphors coherent and sparse in peak (fissure as wound).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveying as dream archeology transforms trope of grieving widower; risk in interlacing technical notes with memories feels inevitable, heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
