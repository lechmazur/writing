<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation intensely rooted in embodied guilt (weeping hand-trace in kitchen), driving ritual choices with contradictory craft devotion vs. motherhood; final vow/renunciation earned by shimmer revelation, foreclosing recovery path with emotional cost. Minor flaw: one diagnostic label ("aching wisdom") edges toward therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via ritual objects to CR closure where gap shimmers as pooled time, reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost (irrecoverable hours as wisdom) in exact line "time itself, pooling like water." Orientation anchored early (Nadia's ascent); single scene flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Midnight glade vividly sensory (stars "warm her skin," moss "luminescent," branches defying geometry), constraining ritual (flat stone table "placed there for exactly this purpose"); recurring cracked saucer charges final blaze and closure image, mirroring internal fracture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover lost time) signaled early, tightens via shimmer reversal (can't recover, only vow future), forcing renunciation with legible cost (leaves card as "offering, a promise"); under Accumulative lens, density reweights motherhood trade-offs without agency slip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of accumulated lost time emerges organically from hand-gap image shifting to future potential, resonant non-literal CR in "daughter's hand, still small enough to fit inside her own"; avoids morals via charged ambiguity of partial repentance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (willing confusion as "doorway to deeper sight"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from choked beauty to released breath, consistent under ritual pressure; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "cards scattered like leaves, forming... 'time's true shape'"); varied rhythm passes ear test, but minor overwriting in glade opener ("choking—so exquisite it squeezed her chest") risks figurative density without peak payoff, slightly dulling entry propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of cartomancy ritual and time-as-negative-space transforms motherhood guilt trope; cloud glade/hand-gap premise feels inevitable, with bold risk in surreal ascent paying off at shimmer CR without gimmick.</comment>
