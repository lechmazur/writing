<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blindness flaw drives competent micro-choices (basin positioning, debris sweep); heartfelt traits shown through precise, prayer-like handling; earned stasis in final calm reveals values hierarchy without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds repair stages to Charged Poise closure ("magnetic calm... small miracles commonplace"); orientation anchored early; conceptual cost of indirect sight repriced in final hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Basin water constrains diagnosis choices across angles, charges repair image; depot/harbor sensory hierarchy (vibrations over sight) mirrors internal mastery; ship blocks sun, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Repair stake dominant, signaled early; accumulative density tightens via motor debris reversal, narrowing failure options; agency in tactical shifts (welder to brush) with felt precision cost, legible in basin checks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual translation emerges via refraction patterns and ship parallel; final image ("world moved... she ready") non-literally reweights blindness premise with resonant cost of isolation-as-strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with vibration/heat perceptual signature; rhythmic syntax modulates repair intensity; purposeful compression in tool access enhances bias without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propulsion, zero loops/artifacts; varied rhythm accelerates through fixes (e.g., "dripped a single drop... listened"); specifics like "finer than an eyelash" replace generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind water-refraction repair transforms artisan trope into fresh perceptual frame; ship's cadence risks parallel closure payoff, synthesizing disability as ingenuity without retreat.</comment>
