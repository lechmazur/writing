<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in practiced craft, with micro-choices like arranging hair in the weaver's favored style revealing values under thin-breath pressure; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly through density build to Charged Poise closure in "You are seen. You are known. You are released," with legible cost in the spark carried into "whatever darkness or light awaited" and stone table descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurora light and consecrated winds constrain choices (e.g., open ceiling glows chip, thin heights contract time) and charge final vigil image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific, selective via professional gaze on calluses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture spark signaled early and deepens texturally as patterns emerge in static, narrowing to transfiguration with chip's clouding as felt cost; one tightening sufficient, agency in ritual endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honoring life's radiance before oblivion emerges organically from infused body and released descent, with final "vast, waiting dark" reweighting particulars without moral; resonant non-literal answer in ongoing vigil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature ("seeing everything, missing nothing") and rhythmic modulation (short amid static, breathing in aurora hush); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from setup to peak transfiguration without loops or scaffolds; minor register elevation in "gossamer-thin" fits voice but borders purple in high-pressure chip-glow beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beautician-mortician channeling static patterns via emerald chip transforms death-ritual trope; risk in skyborne aurora vigil heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
