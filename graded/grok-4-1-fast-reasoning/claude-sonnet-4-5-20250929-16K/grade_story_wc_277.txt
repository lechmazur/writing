<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in observatory reflection ("protecting a dead man's reputation") drives earned shift to truth-seeking; micro-choices like whispering assumptions reveal values under pressure. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("proof by contradiction") borders therapy abstraction but embodies via echo amplification without flattening peak decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journalist call triggers reflection therefore descent/meeting therefore DC closure ("Call her... Harrington papers will run"). On-page cost legible in Chen's warning and her reply; orientation anchored early via observatory/perched above clouds; two-shard structure tightens to single reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echoing dome constrains reflection ("echo of her reasoning bounced... overlapping waves") and charges final image (words "circle the observatory dome"); clouds/stars mirror internal orbits, selective sensory hierarchy (acoustic chaos, light on nib) filters through devoted gaze. Recurrent observatory as micro-setting guides descent choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. legacy) signaled early, tightens via photo analysis narrowing options; agency in "I need to intervene" forecloses protection path with felt cost (family credibility). Chen's warning tests commitment; one decisive deepening suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orbits motif emerges organically from reflection to closure repricing (breaking orbit "by falling back to earth deliberately"); final star image resonates non-literally without moralizing. Articulated contradiction ("Legacy without truth is just mythology") verges on thematic echo but ties to prior philosophy method.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (celestial bias: "orbits of regret"); dialogue subtextual (Chen warns, she counters with method). Rhythm modulates from solemn echoes to lightness; no head-hopping, diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action ("clouds shifted like half-remembered lies"); varied rhythm in echo motif without loops. Minor celestial metaphor density ("predictable paths, unlike human hearts") risks overwriting but supports voice without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy/philosophy transforms inheritance trope via contradiction method and nib talisman; risk in overt philosophizing pays off in deliberate fall image. Non-obvious orbits frame feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
