<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—narrating dark knife thoughts while whittling to reduce mass—act simultaneously, earning the silent bouquet dissolution as a character-specific renunciation with embodied cost (voice crack).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whittling peels density to translucency ("nearly translucent"), culminating in CR closure via disintegrating bouquet without narration, reweighting hush with conceptual cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turbines and bouquet constrain choices (groan masks feeling, petals as grief physicalized) and charge final image ("petals falling like manufactured snow"); micro-setting knife/wood integrates tactilely into whittling pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (lightness via hush) signaled early tightens texturally through whittling cadence matching turbines ("slice, turn, slice"), forcing silent endurance at bouquet touch with felt cost (crack, emptiness).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final non-narrated dissolution ("She didn't narrate this") resonates as answer to hush theme, reweighting Mandate void through particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in flat, dramatic narration ("She lifts the plate... as mandated") biases toward performed void; rhythmic control heightens to crack without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., "petals brown and brittle" advances grief/flowers); varied rhythm propels to closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Mandate void, turbines masking emotion, whittling as grief-reduction transforms dystopian trope via specific, inevitable lightness arc.</comment>
