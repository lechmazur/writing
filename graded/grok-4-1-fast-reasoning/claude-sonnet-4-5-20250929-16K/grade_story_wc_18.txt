<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in craft heritage; embodied grounding contrasts with boundary erosion during attunement, earning the capture choice with felt cost. Micro-choices like mirror adjustments reveal values under pressure. Final endurance restores her firm reality, foreclosing dream-merger path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dream escape → workshop prep → outdoor setup → synchronized capture (DC) with on-page cost in eroded boundaries ("The dream shuddered, recognizing itself"). Orientation anchored early (workshop, fog district). Single-scene scope with tightening via recreation insight; closure reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fog and mirrors constrain tactics (reflect intention/memory); sextant as tool enables structure-viewing. Twilight frost evolves causally, charging "stars...within it" revelation. Sensory filter (crystalline breath, refracted light) biases via POV craft; final workshop image mirrors internal restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent dream-materialization) signaled early, tightens causally via attunement reversal (boundaries erode, forcing precise breathing). Agency in recreation forecloses destruction path; cost legible in "feel the boundary eroding." Escalation narrows options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries emerges via Gregor's longing vs. Eliane's grounding, reweighted in stars-within-fog CR (non-literal answer: hidden skies connect through reflection). Recurring glass/fog shifts from danger to preservation. Ambiguity lingers in restored boundaries' fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (glass/fog geometries); diction/rhythm modulates (short breaths in climax). No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge (understands via mirrors). Prose reflects grounded mind amid textural intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "breathe in rhythm...attune herself to reflection"). Varied rhythm accelerates in climax; no loops, muddled metaphors, or scaffolds. Final image propels with "sharp and beautiful as glass mountains dissolving."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mirrors reflect dreams/intentions in fog-world, transforming tropes via breathing recreation. Risky conceptual pivot (stars in mist) inevitable from particulars; bold single-stake fantasy ingenuity heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
