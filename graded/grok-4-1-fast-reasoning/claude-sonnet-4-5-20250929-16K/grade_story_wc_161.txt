<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete embodiment (hands shake on package) and contradictory impulses (hiding vs. confession); final truth-telling earned by recording cue and prior flinches at Yuki, foreclosing invented life with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: package/recording arrival tightens emotional density toward RR closure ("I need to tell you something"); cost legible in "words hurt like new growth"; orientation anchored early in attic/pigeons.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting (skylight dust motes, crossbeam) constrains rituals and charges final image ("dust motes swirled to the rhythm of dead voices"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific, purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hide truth vs. reveal) signaled early, deepens via recording playback narrowing options; protagonist agency in confession crystallizes stance under lens with reopening-wound cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. reinvention emerges organically via pigeons/dust/choir voices; final image ("dust motes, still dancing. 'Now we see who comes back'") reweights prior lies with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (dust-pattern naming); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're hiding"/"I'm working"); rhythm modulates pressure without head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent/purposeful ("blooming with possibility and withering with guilt"); rhythm propels via varied syntax, climax vivid without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeon post, dust mapping, meteorite in attic confessional; transforms guilt trope via analog rituals, risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
