<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in master's legacy and kingdom's future intensifies through reconsidered refusal to completion; contradictory impulses act in recalled council scene and brush-lifting. Interiority concrete via thorn blood and brush discipline; final change earned with fidelity to deeper truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections on sanctuary, aurora patterns, and drips builds to CR closure—forgery as transformation reweights premise with treason's conceptual cost in "calibrated treason so carefully that it served a greater loyalty." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary, stalactites, aurora constrain patience and charge final image of embedded thorn; sensory hierarchy (drips' rhythm, shifting lights) reflects calligrapher's priorities. Details tactile and purposeful, mirroring internal shift from illusion of permanence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—treasonous forgery vs. freeing kingdoms—tightens accumulatively via weeks of dripping reconsideration to brush-lifting agency; cost legible in moral trade-off crystallized at dawn completion. One deepening forecloses initial refusal with felt loyalty price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from particulars (stone worn by drips, unfinished decree completed); final image of dulled thorn reconfigures forgery as authentic truth without moralizing. Resonance in "keys open locks we didn't know existed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via calligraphic lens ("measured in brushstrokes," "unlink her own desire"); rhythmic prose modulates from tension to charged poise. Stable third-limited POV with no leakage; diction biased to art's transformative power.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (drips motif varies openings); minor paraphrase loops in aurora/stalactite repeats dull momentum slightly in middle but tie to closure image. No artifacts in peak completion beat; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy forgery as calibrated treason transforms trope of betrayal; rose thorn ink and sanctuary's enduring stone create memorable, organic angle. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
