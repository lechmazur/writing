<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between hiding and mission act in scene via snow-reading choice and response composition; final renunciation of ghost-life earned by accumulating realizations with embodied cost in "something uncurl in her chest." Character-particular interiority shines in weather-observer lens on drifts; Marcus applies relational pressure without flattening Claire's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: snow messages and reflections build density to Charged Poise closure in "When do we leave?" with legible cost of abandoning safe station life. Orientation anchored early at Zephyr Bluff; backstory shards tilt present micro-choices without exceeding BRR. Single-POV shard structure fits defaults, pattern taught implicitly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow drifts as micro-setting constrain communication method and charge final image of "silver hush... like permission"; zephyr winds and mist evolve causally, mirroring internal thaw. Sensory hierarchy (readable shapes in powder) reflects Claire's priorities; setting guides choice via ephemeral codes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair mission vs. hide) signaled early via pillbox, tightens accumulatively through snow revelations to stance crystallization; agency in photographing/response forces trade-off of safety. Cost visible in "disappearing wasn't... healing"; pressure coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repairing world over self emerges from snow-pattern accumulation and pillbox reinterpretation; final image reweights "fix what's broken" non-literally via spring defeat of winter. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; protagonist arc inextricable from conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in wind/snow metaphors; dialogue natural/subtextual ("All of them") advances reunion without exposition. Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity; no head-hopping, voice biased toward observer precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., snow-code reveal advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no major loops though "silver hush" echoes purposeful. Minor figurative density in reflections ("patient as snowfall") nears overwrite but ties to closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Snow-as-code medium transforms spy tropes via weather logic; prudently daring survival and barometric response feel inevitable from particulars. Fresh synthesis of observation station as crucible; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
