<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic traits drive contradictory impulses from doubt ("affection and doubt in equal measure") to hopeful transcription, earning final endurance as translator with grief-cost integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density from tile discovery to visions to transcription; CR closure lands in final image of shifting tile under fingers, reweighting skepticism with undeniable conceptual cost of persistent grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower's crumbling walls and whale-song resonance constrain isolation/reflection, charging tile as micro-setting that mirrors internal states; final transcription amid autumn migration evolves environment tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of skepticism vs. whale-memory belief deepens accumulatively through palm-to-tile visions revealing shared grief, forcing stance shift to transcription with foreclosed guarded-heart option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of kindness/memory as resonance emerges organically from tile particulars, final image reweighting patients as "notes in a larger composition" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature filters science through poetic bias ("dead light safer than living flesh"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in vision sequence without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated sensory images; no loops, coherent metaphors like "sound into wax" avoid muddle even in reflective peaks.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square encoding whale consciousness transforms isolation trope, with tile visions risking bold conceptual entanglement that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
