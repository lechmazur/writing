<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and embodied motivation in seed-sorting textures and heart hammering at moonstone; micro-choices like prodding reveal hierarchy of obsessive watching. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene prevents 9+; steady pursuit dominates without shown friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from seed sorting to moonstone prods and monument climax. CR closure lands on-page in "Understanding bloomed within her like flowers from ash," reweighting years of watching with conceptual cost of reconfiguration; orientation anchored early in arbor work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "mossy delight" and upward-falling seeds filter through Miren's sorter bias, constraining choices via sorting table and twigs. Arbor setting charges final blooming image, evolving causally from gray to shimmering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode leaves signaled early, tightens via moonstone discovery narrowing interpretive options under accumulative lens. Agency in repeated prods forces deepening with moss patterns; cost felt in patient years reconfigured at "translator of possibility."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of eternal emergence arises organically from transforming leaves/seeds/moss, culminating in resonant CR: "Nothing stayed fixed. Everything was always emerging." Final arbor blooming reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of possibilities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in obsessive pattern-noticing (ridged ember-seeds, spiral windwhispers). Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, compression purposeful in hush-time elisions paid off at transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moss sprouted—actual living moss, verdant and impossible"); rhythm varies read-aloud without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening descriptions purposeful under accumulative lens, no muddle at peak moss/monument beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skyborne arbor folklore and mineral impossibility transforms tropes via lived sorting; moonstone prod turns feel inevitable from established patterns. Bold risk in upward physics and emergent prophecy heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
