<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's prosopagnosia creates contradictory impulses—face-blind yet reads "architecture of gesture"—driving her insight into the killer's loneliness; final sketch choice earned via ribbon examination with shaking hands as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations density-build to CR closure: Vera's sketch of "negative space" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of unseen creator's ache, legible in "hollow ache of their hands."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry's "mist-wrapped" descent and "ancient chisel marks" constrain movement and mirror internal fog-clearing; final "stone and shadow" charges image, with sensory narrowing under realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken killer's empathy) signaled early tightens via ribbon insight narrowing options to paint absence; protagonist agency in reconstruction, cost felt in hands shaking before Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges implicitly from mask insight to final portrait of "artist and destroyer"; resonant non-literal answer in sketch reweights blindness/empathy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("grammar of posture"); rhythmic control modulates to lyrical intensity at "Vera began to draw," no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in lines like "topology of murder" propels without loops; figurative language purposeful and coherent, though dense in realization beat slightly risks overwrite but supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist intuiting mask-maker killer via non-facial cues; risk-taking in CR portrait of absence feels inevitable, transforming cold case trope organically.</comment>
