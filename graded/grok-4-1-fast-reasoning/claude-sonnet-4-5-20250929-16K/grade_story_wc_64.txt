<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's blithe competence shines in systematic decoding, earning the final rose-planting renunciation with felt emotional cost; micro-choices like floorboard search reveal values under solitary pressure, though contradictory impulses act subtly rather than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as thread-decoding density builds to "beneath silo" discovery and letters; CR closure reconfigures echoes as lost love with undeniable conceptual cost in final letter's image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt silo and stars constrain solitary decoding and charge final "cobalt silence" image; selective sensory details (star-lanced darkness, curved ceiling) mirror internal discovery without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode note tightens via emerging pattern narrowing to floor search; agency in untangling forecloses ignorance with realization cost legible in letters' press to heart.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-tending emerges from particulars like frayed threads and rose decision, reweighting uncharted echoes without moralizing; final image offers resonant non-literal answer to intentions' shape.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with perceptual signature (beauty in decay) modulates rhythmically; poetic diction like "velveteen gloom" remains character-bound and legible under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density weaves action and image without loops; purposeful metaphors (moth wings, starlight-drinking silo) cohere, though minor overwriting in opening slightly dulls propulsion before peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thread-cipher decoding transforms inheritance trope into fresh code-of-loss synthesis; risk in tapestry mechanic feels inevitable, heightening emotional stakes organically.</comment>
