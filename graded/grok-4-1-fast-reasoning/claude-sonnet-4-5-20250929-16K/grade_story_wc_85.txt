<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in Maren's resistance to truth versus her search, earning the final confession with embodied release ("something loosen in her chest"); flaws complicate without hedging; voice particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via search density to watch hand discovery and Clara's revelation; CR closure lands on-page ("Maren finally did") with conceptual cost of misquelled protection reweighted; orientation anchored early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and driftwood shore constrain choices via sifting and wind threading hair; watch hand as micro-setting charges final image in Clara's hand; sensory hierarchy POV-specific; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via carved hand recognition forcing confession; agency in endurance then release; cost legible in relational exposure; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of protection-from-hope emerges organically via Iris's fear revealed in Clara's words, reweighting Maren's premise without moralizing; final image resonates non-literally; ambiguity lingers in complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias (heavy driftwood); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("What did my mother want me never to know?"); rhythmic control modulates regret; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion weaves reflection into action (e.g., "Sift through his work"); final line recharges cobalt sky motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood penance and twin watch hand synthesize fresh angle on historical forgery facing personal lie; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight without template echoes.</comment>
