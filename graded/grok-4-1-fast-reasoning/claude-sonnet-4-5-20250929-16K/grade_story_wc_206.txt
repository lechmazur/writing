<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority and embodied truth-affliction drive motivation, with micro-choice to steady breath against scattering risk revealing values; minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak weave keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from single box to chorus, landing Charged Poise RR in final braiding image where covenant reconfirms against decay's cost; orientation anchored early, lens clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Resonance chamber as violin-curved amplifier constrains and enables hum-weave tactic while charging closure chorus; sensory selection (ticks to cathedral song) perfectly mirrors stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant covenant-restoration stake signaled early tightens accumulatively box-by-box under self-deception risk, with agency in tethering foreclosing scatter-failure path; felt cost legible in "one false note" balance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of covenant over stasis emerges organically from reweaving particulars, with final singing boxes as non-literal answer reweighting decay premise; no moralizing, ambiguity in imperishability lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with distinct perceptual signature in musical biases; rhythmic modulation heightens weave pressure without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied musical syntax, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak "reweave" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh philosopher-chip/covenant synthesis transforms repair trope into covenant metaphysics, with risk-taking in abstract-tactile weave inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
