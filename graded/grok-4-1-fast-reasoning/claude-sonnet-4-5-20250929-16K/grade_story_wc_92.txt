<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's calmly inventive nature drives consistent micro-choices like encoding messages under Voss's footsteps, revealing interior contradiction between guardianship facade and revolutionary drive. Embodied tension peaks in stillness during the patrol, with motivation intensifying via the 72-hour deadline. Competence dominates without deep flaws complicating the peak, but endurance feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from coded sundial to 17 confirmations, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("the spark had caught") with felt risk cost in Voss's near-discovery and ticking deadline. Single scene anchors early; one tightening via message exchange narrows revolutionary options purposefully. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial's textured angles constrain Mira's encoding choices and charge the final memory-trace, evolving from eyesore to revolutionary hub. Sensory details (trailing fingers in blackness, chiming keys) filter through lock sentinel bias, mirroring internal spark amid blackout. Luminous walls reconfigure at dawn image, integrating setting into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spark revolution) signaled early, escalates via textural density of network responses and Voss pressure, forcing micro-renunciation of visibility. One tightening (quill holder exchange) reweights with 72-hour cost, charging final poise. Agency in patient encoding drives under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden resistance emerges from sundial codes and whispers, reweighted in dawn image contrasting surface brilliance with subsurface ignition. Subtext in "winking hush" invites ambiguity on revolution's cost without moralizing. Final reconfiguration answers guardianship-vs-rebellion implicitly through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: inventive noticing of angles/textures amid stress. Rhythmic modulation accelerates in Voss beat ("remained perfectly still"), diction hushed and biased. No head-hopping; voice distinct without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "cradle of sparks" embeds theme/action); varied rhythm breathes with tension, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful and coherent, clarity peaks in tactile encoding. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious sundial codes transform spy trope into patient revolution, with fresh "angles" synthesis inevitable from inventive traits. Risky hush-tone heightens stakes; no derivative echoes, full premise commitment charges poise closure.</comment>
