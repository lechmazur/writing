<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Miranda's receptivity to signs motivates planting the seed immediately after arrival, earning her pivot to plant-integrated puzzles; interiority concrete via research obsession. Minor slip: final mentor reveal feels slightly unearned without prior hints of relationship, but endurance of independence lands with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as plant growth density reweights stakes from threat to innovation; orientation anchors early (escape room by brook). Closure as CR via mentor reveal and final brook image reconfigures protection premise with felt independence cost on "keep Labyrinth's End independent."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brook's "quiet murmur" and "moonlight through willows" constrain nocturnal puzzles and charge final image beside "bloom and the brook." Sensory evolution from "storm-born silence" to "hush of this particular dawn" mirrors transformation perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard business) signaled via buyouts tightens accumulatively as plant draws visitors, forcing innovation in "new escape rooms around the garden." Agency in designing "The Corpse Flower Mystery" forecloses chain path with legible independence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unique innovation via mysteries emerges organically from seed-to-bloom arc; final "hush... like permission" offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in scent as "part of the story" embraces decay's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in synchronicities ("answer to a question she'd been asking"); professor quote natural. Rhythmic control modulates from lyrical openings to punchy bloom reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "leaves unfurling like dark secrets" advancing atmosphere and momentum; no loops. Minor overwriting in "heavy with possibility" but purposeful for voice, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower as puzzle element transforms buyout trope via botanical impossibility; mentor seed legacy risks bold payoff without gimmick.</comment>
