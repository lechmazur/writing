<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker's motivation rooted in grief compels micro-choices like dowsing and absorbing notes, with embodied contradiction peaking at "breath caught, but she did not stop." Final stasis earned through prior tactile mapping, revealing hierarchy of determination over chaos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: note density builds melody, tightening to silence in clearing for Charged Poise RR. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in "nothing needed to be mapped because nothing needed to be escaped." Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and platinum ring constrain path and charge final image, with tactile details like "leaves whistled at pitches that shattered glass" filtered through blind POV. Moss and earth ground climax kneel without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find stillpoint signaled early; melody recognition deepens pressure under Accumulative lens, narrowing to urgent forward pull. Agency in persistent dowsing forecloses escape with emotional cost felt in completed song.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unmappable grief emerges through particulars like wife's melody trail; final image reconfigures love/grief coordinates without moralizing. Resonance from intertwined forest/melody languages avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd tactile signature with rhythmic modulation: short sentences accelerate at "notes came faster now." Perceptual bias toward skin/vibration distinct and consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("syntax of sorrow, grammar of waiting") risks coherence without peak harm. Closure lines propel cleanly without loops; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skin-absorbed ultrasound and emotional cartography transforms grief trope; stillpoint realization feels inevitable from ring-led trail. Bold blind navigator risks pay off in tactile ingenuity.</comment>
