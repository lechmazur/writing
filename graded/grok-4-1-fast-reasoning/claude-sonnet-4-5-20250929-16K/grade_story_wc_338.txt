<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elena's methodical curiosity roots motivation in map-restorer traits, yielding earned change via her surprising recommendation. Interiority particularized through map analogies, with embodied focus on footage thresholds. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in-scene caps just below peak; final micro-choice reveals values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footage comparison accumulates density to spiral grass discovery, tightening to foundations reveal and CR closure in dawn realization/submitted report. Orientation anchored early in workshop/henge. Cost legible in "shielded openness" protecting unprovable, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresco vault and henge (via footage) constrain solitary analysis, mirroring absence theme; dawn light through frescoes charges final image. Sensory selection POV-biased toward interpretive silences, grass spiral purposeful. Workshop enables night work, evolves with rain cessation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret silence for Trust) signaled early, deepens via identical visitor gestures → grass/foundations, forcing empathetic recommendation under accumulative lens. Agency in frame-enhancement/cross-referencing forecloses tidy stability proof. Visible cost in self-surprising exposure of "wound"; tight but single decisive intensification fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silence/absence theme emerges from footage silences, map gaps, spiral growth; final "map of human longing" CR reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, with ambiguity in unprovable protected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with map-framer perceptual signature (thresholds, white space). Voice lyrical yet precise, modulating from methodical to revelatory; syntax reflects interpretive poise under sustained attention-pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "grass... growing in a subtle spiral"); varied rhythm propels from comparison to dawn cadence. No loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (framing absence), purposeful elevation fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: map-restorer interprets henge silences via footage spirals/foundations, transforming ancient-site trope into absence-faith CR. Risk in quiet, conceptual closure heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
