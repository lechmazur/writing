<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of stellar doubt and quiet enthusiasm act simultaneously in coin casts and receiver adjustments; final purpose realization earned by accumulating prophecies with felt cost of persistent uncertainty. Interiority concrete via coin textures and chest-harmonizing bursts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via two coin casts tightening prophecy alignment to Charged Poise closure ("Kael understood then why she'd survived"), reweighting purpose with undeniable conceptual cost of doubt-endurance; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring coins and amber glow constrain choices (casts dictate frequencies) and charge final image ("coins glinted in the amber light"); sensory bursts evolve purposefully, mirroring internal harmonizing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose-alignment escalates accumulatively: first prophecy permits proceeding, second deepens chest harmony forcing realization; agency in casts forecloses prediction/control path with legible doubt-cost charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of decision-making over outcomes emerges organically from prophecy fragments and casts; final image of tender coin-gathering offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting backwards wisdom without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward coin patterns and burst melodies; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity ("static bursts came faster now"), heightening pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated sensory action; minor repetition of eye-closing avoided escalation penalty as it anchors ritual without loop; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse coin-oracles and backwards prophecies transforms divination tropes into inevitable purpose-witnessing; risk-taking in temporal lyric heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
