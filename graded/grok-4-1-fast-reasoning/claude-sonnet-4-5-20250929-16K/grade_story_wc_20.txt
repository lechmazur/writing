<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's balanced nature creates contradiction—equilibrium vs. guilt-driven risk—embodied in sacrificing her ring; final redemption earned via prior failure. Kael's return reveals deepened identity without unearned epiphany. Interiority particular, flaws (poor answer to Kael) drive ritual choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflection densities to ritual spin, yielding RR closure (Kael's return reconfigures names/balance) with cost (ring sacrifice, golden scars). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-washed foundry, slick floors, warm coin constrain ritual (gold powder tracing vanishes lines); sensory hierarchy (dripping rafters, glowing coin) mirrors regret, charges final kneeling image. Micro-setting (anvils, workbench) guides precise actions without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem failure/understand names) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via kintsugi ritual narrowing options (embrace fracture vs. erase). Agency in measured invocation; cost legible in shimmering regret, scars—forecloses tidy recovery path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Names-as-vessels theme emerges from coin spiral, Cassian whisper, scars; final image (rain washing scars untouched) reweights balance premise non-literally with ambiguity (all names held). No moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited; perceptual signature (alchemical precision in noticing angles, tongues) biased by Mira's craft. Lyrical diction modulates to peak ("luminous regret"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I found it... All of them").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to spin/return; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in climax ("gold light filled fractures"). Minor overwriting in opening reflection ("factually mystical") but purposeful, woven into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical kintsugi + zodiac names transforms disappearance trope; risk in "factually mystical" ritual pays off in scars image. Inevitable hindsight from coin setup; bold premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
