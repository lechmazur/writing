<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's intrepid skill and family motivation drive consistent micro-choices like threading the maze, with embodied stress ("stomach lurched") under Turning pressure. Internal conflict is light, shown more in competence than contradictory impulses. Final canister grasp earns her change without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Turning tremors → maze flight → echo chamber → grandmother's voice → First Orchard dig → canister DC with time cost ("racing the final moments"). Orientation anchors early (Verdansk, skiff, orchards). Closure reconfigures knowledge/options with legible proof cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches and water streams constrain maze choices and charge final dig amid falling fruit. Sensory hierarchy (water "script," engines whine) filters via pilot bias. Setting evolves causally with inversion, mirroring internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience source) tightens causally via echo revelation narrowing to 30-min race, forcing trade-off flight. Protagonist agency in water navigation and dig pays visible cost (chaos, hands digging). Escalation coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stolen resilience emerges via echoes preserving truth, culminating in non-literal CR: "echoes remember everything" reweights family history without moralizing. Particulars (crossed ledger) avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in council confrontation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with pilot perceptual signature (water as "script," arches rotating). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity ("whined, adjusting thrust"). No head-hopping or withholding; elisions absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "water from canals rose in shimmering columns"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. No figurative muddle or register drift in peak Turning beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity-inverting orchards + acoustic echoes transform discovery trope via causal world logic. Risky Turning flight heightens stakes organically; no derivative templates.</comment>
