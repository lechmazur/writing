<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in hesitation before playing the flute despite fear, earning the closure realization; interiority particular via guilt-replay tied to micro-choices like marker placement. Flaw of obsessive failure-hoarding drives stakes without safety-hedging. Final acceptance feels character-bound with embodied relief "crashing through her."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: markers build density to shimmer reveal, yielding CR closure where "failure belonged to time itself" reweights premise with entropy's cost. Orientation anchors early (Mira in canyon post-guardianship). No lens ambiguity; constraint of fading flute shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "pockets of absolute silence" guiding markers and stone tests, charging closure when she "touched the canyon wall, feeling how silence pooled." Sensory hierarchy (sound-deadening prioritized) reflects POV urgency. Amphitheater integrates tactilely without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest failure insights) signaled early tightens via shimmer-deepening, forcing agency in continued playing despite erosion; cost legible as "reeds...dying, slowly losing their connection." Lens escalation via density reweights to acceptance, foreclosing restoration path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "graceful collapse" emerges organically from markers/flute/shimmer, final image ("wisdom in witnessing...without looking away") offering non-literal repricing without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like fading artifact reweights self-blame. Counter-reading (world thrives sans her) adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in silence-as-texture noticing ("silence had texture, almost tangible"); rhythm modulates with intensity (short sentences at shimmer). POV stable, no elision debt; compression taught early via canyon entry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "sound stretched, attenuating into something else—a bridge" doing triple duty (action/atmosphere/causality); no loops, metaphors coherent (snowpack to avalanche quiet). Propulsion peaks clean at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of liminal entropy via fading reeds transforms portal trope; risk in quiet CR ending heightens via "document...architecture of endings." Inevitable hindsight from marker path to wall-touch.</comment>
