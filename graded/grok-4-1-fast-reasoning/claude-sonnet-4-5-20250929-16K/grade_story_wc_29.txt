<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with stress degrading vision and bones vibrating during climax; cautious hope drives micro-adjustments under risk, earning the final documentation. Contradictory impulses surface in her awareness of potential failure amid steady hands. No safety-hedging; flaws like isolation amplify her competence-struggle balance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: preparation because signals changed, therefore broadcast initiates DC when signals stop with her physical strain as cost. Orientation anchors in first paragraph; single scene tightens via generator hum to silence. Closure legible in "cosmic signals stopped" and footsteps uniting factions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Basement studio's dust-ozone and charts constrain choices, with oscilloscope waveforms charging climax; sensory hierarchy narrows to vibrations and colors under crisis. Final chart-marking recharges setting as victory anchor. POV bias filters via astronomical lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—counter tricksters—tightens causally via adaptation probes, forcing frequency adjustments with embodied cost (vision swims). Agency peaks in sequence initiation, foreclosing amplification risk. Cost unmistakable in trembling charts and thickened air.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of regaining autonomy emerges via signal writhing to silence, reweighting discord as manipulation without moralizing. Final dawn and marked charts resonate non-literally on human thinking. Particulars like armbands avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in cosmic patterns and waveforms; diction modulates from analytical to urgent ("pitch climbed higher"). Rhythmic control heightens pressure in battle beats. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, every line propels via integrated sensory-action. Propulsion peaks in "waveforms danced and merged," vivid without overwriting. Zero figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic signals as playful manipulators countered by subsonic interference transforms alien contact trope. Risk in untested math heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from charts to victory marking.</comment>
