<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dye master's watchful traits drive concrete micro-choices like holding the wing and startling at observation; interiority particular via light/hue bias and embodied heart rhythm; final acceptance earned by prior confessions and revelation, confronting flaw of isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from post-heart confessions to proprietor's reveal tightening to CR closure; orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "weight of carrying their truths" and final placement of wing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sun trails and morpho wing as micro-setting constrain perception and charge final blazing image; sensory details (mist, steam, mossy chains) selective via dye master's bias; floating tea house guides quiet revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why post-heart magnetism) signaled early, deepens via proprietor tying wing to prior owner; agency in listening/accepting forecloses isolation; cost felt in "iridescent caution" responsibility, reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of prisms revealing truths emerges via wing/light motifs shifting meaning; final image non-literally answers "why" with resonance; subtext in proprietor's words avoids statement, complexity in gift/burden ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (light trails, hue shifts); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (proprietor prompts confession); rhythmic prose modulates from watchful calm to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "steam rose like valley mist"); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (light-bending wing); no loops or artifacts, propulsion peaks in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye mastery, donor heart inheritance, and story-magnetism via iridescent structures; wing transforms caution trope into prism gift; risk in quiet CR closure heightens emotional specificity.</comment>
