<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's motivation to restore from ruin intensifies through embodied persistence, culminating in earned voice break during halo polishing and cranking; contradictory silence vs. emerging hum acts simultaneously in the work scene, with final softer singing as visible cost of fuller silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (silence, chimes, gleam) building to Charged Poise closure in carousel's turning and echo-held silence; wrong turn discovery anchors orientation early, with cost legible in leaving mechanism spinning as possibility reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wind bells and willow ring constrain discovery and mark time via chimes, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (clinking tools, dust motes in golden bars) filters through carpenter's restorative gaze, evolving causally with no spatial slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silence-as-possibility tightens accumulatively via discovery-deepening to singing/cranking reversal, narrowing to endurance of restored motion; cost felt in halting song amid fuller silence, agency in persistent hands forcing mechanism surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as question answered by wrong-turn possibility emerges organically from restoration beats, resonant in final carousel echo without moralizing; halo's multiplied crescents reweight prior ruin motifs non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-limited perceptual signature (curved bones, dulled brass) biases toward restorative detail, rhythmic modulation peaks in singing harmony with bells; stable distance, purposeful lyric compression taught early via mist threading cattails.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in lines like "humming became singing—not words, but pure sound" propels without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm breathes with scene (slow work to spinning crescendo), no figurative muddle in peak crank beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abandoned circus salvage into silence-song possibility via halo-carousel oasis; risk in lyric accumulative drive transforms trope ruins without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight from persistent wrong turn.</comment>
