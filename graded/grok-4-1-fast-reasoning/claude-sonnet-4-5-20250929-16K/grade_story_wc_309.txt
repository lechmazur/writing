<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy and exam failures drives climb and placement; interiority embodied in "muscles burning" and chest shift. Contradictory impulses between old persistence and Academy pressure act in mist walking and keystone lift. Final renunciation of automatist validation earned via prior struggle, but epiphany phrasing borders on overt at "passed the only examination that mattered."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from climb through mist to keystone fit; orientation anchored early ("strapped the garden folly keystone to her back"). Closure as Conceptual Repricing in "light that refused to forget" reweights premise with effort cost (climb, slow magic). Persistent constraint of keystone's weightlessness shapes all tactics; no ambiguity, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist, ice fractals, and keystone vines constrain choices (mist walking enables ascent, ice reveals patterns); recurring keystone charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: luminance glow over automated clarity. Details evolve causally (mist accepts weight, light chases fractals), mirroring internal wonder without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore old magic, self-validation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via mist walk deepening and keystone placement narrowing options to physical limit. Agency in unstrapping/placing forecloses failure path with felt cost ("muscles burning"). Escalation coherent under Textural lens; Academy threat complicates but does not resolve. Minor abstractness in stakes ("sacred lived in simple stone") visible only late.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty/impossibility vs. efficiency emerges organically from keystone motifs shifting to "light remembered itself." Final image ("gentle heartbeat in stone") offers non-literal resonant answer to automation premise, reweighting prior failures. Subtext in grandmother cues and spire glow embraces ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in "impossibilities" and "brilliant dimness" diction; syntax modulates rhythm for ascent (short steps in mist) to lyrical close. Voice texture distinct: vine patterns, lingering light as biased noticing. No dialogue; purposeful compression in reflections legible under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short mist steps to flowing light spread); high density in "light chasing itself through frozen fractals." Minor paraphrase loop in luminance descriptions ("glow that persisted," "light remembered") dulls one peak beat slightly. Zero scaffold; propulsion clear to closure image, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated magic era with "follies" as highest purpose transforms mage failure trope; keystone/mist walking turns feel inevitable from vine patterns and grandmother anchor. Bold Textural risk in lyric ascent heightens stakes without obscurity; no derivative echoes.</comment>
