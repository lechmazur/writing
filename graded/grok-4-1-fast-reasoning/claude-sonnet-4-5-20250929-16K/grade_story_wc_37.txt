<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's scattered embodiment creates contradictory impulses in her humming amid drifting fragments; final dissolution earned as sacrificial wholeness with visible cost in thinning self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: songs densify fragments/dawns/communities to CR closure in "her final fragment dissolved as the first true sunrise broke"; cost legible in orchard sunrise image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shards-as-memory-keeper synthesizing mirror inversion and dissolution-as-wholeness feels inevitable; bold reverse-world premise transformed through song-dawn weaving.</comment>
