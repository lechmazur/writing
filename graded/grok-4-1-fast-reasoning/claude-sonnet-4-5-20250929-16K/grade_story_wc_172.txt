<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve echo tightens via release amid thunder's approach, foreclosing map's permanence; agency in placing egg forces trade-off with erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of dove singing to thunder reweights destroyed water as beauty's cost, emerging from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
