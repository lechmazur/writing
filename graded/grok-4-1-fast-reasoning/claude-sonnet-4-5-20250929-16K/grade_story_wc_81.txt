<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's tranquilly perceptive trait enables methodical indexing turning into urgent photographing under footsteps pressure, with embodied shift ("anger and determination flickering") earning the pocketed stamp choice; no major unearned epiphanies, but interiority occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction over raw contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through discovery chain (letters → hypothesis → archive → portfolio → stamp realization), with on-page CR closure in escape and proof secured, cost legible in blackout's end ("lights flickered back on two hours later") forcing return to indexing guise; orientation anchored early, single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library's glass walls, creaks, and water-damaged drawers constrain choices (memory navigation in dark, ajar door), charging final ocean image; sensory details (headlamp, pressure-groan) filter through Marcus's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover sabotage proof) signaled early, tightens causally via footsteps reversal forcing faster agency and escape; cost visible in risked detection and foreclosed open pursuit, though security remains off-page voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved truths emerges organically from stamp's reweighting (grandmother's silenced fight), final image resonantly answering displacement origins without moralizing; particulars like portfolio predate flood avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (light metaphors suit underwater library), rhythmic control modulates tension; no dialogue, but diction purposeful without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "photographing faster, prioritizing"), varied rhythm propels; minor metaphor pile-up in reflective lines ("light through deep water") borders overwriting but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken-city conspiracy via ink stamp links personal history freshly; transforms archival trope through blackout access and quiet resistance ending, with risk in pocketed proof.</comment>
