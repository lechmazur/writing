<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority in translating lamp hum to fictional girl's emotions, rooted in studious traits; micro-choices like recording shifts reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—no genuine internal struggle or flaw complicating the serene routine. Earned endurance in discipline fits single-POV baseline, but harmony limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: density builds from charting hum to completing invented history to placing it in labyrinth for Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation anchored immediately (workshop, lamp, labyrinth). Final image of history weathering carries felt cost of isolation, reconfiguring invention as preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (hum oscillations, blossom perfume, refracted light) filtered through her textural priorities; bonsai labyrinth as micro-setting constrains and mirrors her compressed histories. Recurring lamp/notepad charge choices and final image. Pivotal: cherry blossoms falling like pink snow evolve with her work, guiding placement act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting/preserving time textures) signaled early; accumulative tightening via hum shift deepening fictional girl's vertigo realization narrows to placement choice. Minimal opposition, but endurance forecloses return to town's words with isolation cost legible in final discipline affirmation. Agency in routine sustains coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of invention's textural truth emerges organically from particulars (compressed bonsai as infinite worlds, gilded histories aging real); final image reweights premise without moralizing—"luminous architecture of things that never were" resonates as non-literal answer. Subtext in silence enabling granularity avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature: textural bias in "gilded script...hover above the page," syntax/rhythm modulating from precise charting to lyrical expansion. No head-hopping or withholding; voice coheres as studious lyricism under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm—no loops, scaffold, or muddled metaphors; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "pink snow") taught early, propels accumulative texture. Propulsion peaks in "pressed gold leaf onto final page," concise and sensory. Minor density in opening metaphors doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal stationer, hum-data histories, bonsai compression transforms silence trope into generative discipline; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes of invention's reality. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from lamp-notepad-labyrinth pattern, no derivative echoes.</comment>
