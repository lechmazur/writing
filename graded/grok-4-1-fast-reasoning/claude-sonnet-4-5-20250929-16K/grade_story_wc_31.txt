<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied synesthetic fragments (foghorn crimson) root motivation concretely; trembling hands and throat-tightening reveal contradictory grief/quest impulses acting in dive; final lamp-lighting reverence earns stasis from causal buildup without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density from dive entry to journal entry; CR closure in surfacing vision ("ribbon of gold-green-violet") reconfigures quest into witnessing with legible grief-cost ambiguity; orientation anchored early in pier/harbor setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library's brine-suspended cases constrain handling choices and charge final escaping-ribbon image; synesthetic sensory hierarchy (headlamp sweep, hull groan vibration) filters via POV urgency; sky lanterns evolve to mirror visions purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (journals for mother's spectrum) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through last-entry revelation narrowing to vows-failure ambiguity; vision forecloses full discovery with felt uncertainty cost; minor abstractness in pre-dive stakes tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emergent theme of witnessing over solving reweights via amber bell toll final image, non-literal answer to color/sound premise; subtext in vows-as-chromatic binds complexity without moralizing; particulars (journal labels) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("foghorn blasts sparked crimson") biases noticing consistently under dive stress; rhythmic modulation accelerates in descent, breathes in revelation; stable limited-POV with no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., key tag as mnemonic pulls to case); zero loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere in synesthesia without muddle; varied syntax/paragraphs build read-aloud cadence to charged poise close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthete lamplighter's wreck-dive for chromatic vows transforms ghost-ship trope via sensory fusion; fresh "color of sound" premise inevitable in hindsight from inherited fragments; risk in lyric vision heightens stakes organically.</comment>
