<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via wood-grain reading and inherited persistence; contradictory child-self (protected vs. transformed) acts in scene through assembly and step; final renunciation earned by causal discoveries with irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from memory fragments to logbook reveal; CR closure lands on "stepped through" with terrace dissolution as undeniable conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and oak planks constrain choice (creaks, panels shift, drift away forces step); selective tactile details (grain whorls, whispering pages) charge final dissolution image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshold mystery) signaled early, deepens via grain/logbook under Accumulative lens; agency in analysis forecloses circling-back option with felt irreversibility at "did not look back."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Necessary distances theme emerges organically from maze/logbook/partners' geometries; resonant CR ending reweights irreversibility without moralizing, via "sacred meant not divine but irreversible."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern-intuiting bias); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed reflection to charged step; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "grain swirled around a knot like water around a stone" advances revelation/atmosphere); no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies for propulsion to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze/pilot geometries in prism-memory space; bold lyric risk (drifting dissolution) heightens stakes, feels inevitable via grain-revelation turn.</comment>
