<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in visions and scars compels micro-choices like holding the clipping and leading the maze recreation, with embodied anxious elation; secondary characters apply immediate pressure via emergence and linking. Internal conflict subtle in trapped body vs. expanded mind. Minor archetypal flattening in group ("woman with no eyes," etc.) prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions and gatherings density-build to CR closure in maze crystallization and realization ("guide others through it"), reweighting premise with scar-cost legible in "network of shared pain." Single continuous scene, orientation anchored early ("cobalt glade," post-Acceleration). One tightening via linking touch and group assembly narrows to collective purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and dusk constrain choreography (wheelchair, emerging from shadows) and charge final image (darkness claims as maze shapes). Sensory selective (luminescence, blue-barked trees, glowing scars); wheelchair/body as micro-setting mirrors root-bound state. No spatial drift despite group arrival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find/recreate intersection) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density (Chen's arrival → group emergence → scar-linking → maze-building), forcing collective stance crystallization. Agency in holding clipping and directing work; cost felt in "shared pain" foreclosing isolation. Enters 8+ via trade-off of broken bodies for purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of broken guiding future emerges from scar-linking and maze-of-possibility, resonant in final CR without moralizing; topiary shifts from fragment to pattern anchor. Subtext in "eclipsed covenant" implies cost of ignored warnings. Borders thematic echo in last lines but stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable, perceptual signature in visionary bias (shadows as fingers, visions branching); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You came," "eclipsed covenant") advances via recognition. No head-hopping despite group.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows), no loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent ("time in eddies," "crystallized possibility"). Minor overwriting in opening ("impossible luminescence," "shadows like fingers") but purposeful for tone. Propulsion strong to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Acceleration-rupture, scar-networks, and possibility-maze transforms post-apocalypse trope; risk in group emergence coheres under visionary lens. Final reconfiguration ("living intersection") inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes via conceptual boldness.</comment>
