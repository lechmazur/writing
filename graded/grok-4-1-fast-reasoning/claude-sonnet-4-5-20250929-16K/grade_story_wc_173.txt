<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the resisting threads scene, compelling her to pull against expectations; final autonomy earned with the cost of prior chaste distance reconfigured. Interiority concrete via embodied gestures tying to grandmother's stance. No safety-hedging in her defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of gestures builds to sanctuary emergence; closure as Charged Poise in "threads she had untangled would never knot the same way again," with legible cost of foreclosed conformity. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/snow. Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow and geometric patterns constrain her steps, charging the ritual; body as micro-setting in spine curving and dancer's stance mirrors internal shift. Sensory hierarchy sharpens to prismatic light under crisis. Final dawn evolution recharges setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to access truth tightens accumulatively as threads resist then yield, narrowing to echo-harvest with deepening knowledge of resistance. Agency in micro-choices like tracing patterns forecloses safe performance. Cost felt in transformed body/resolve charging end image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of autonomy beneath performance emerges organically from echoes (mother's defiance, founder's weeping), reweighting premise in final true smile without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in bodily-poetic noticing (tilted head, extended palm) biases toward invisible threads; rhythmic control modulates with serenity build. Stable close-third POV, no leakage. Voice texture purposeful and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with lines like "space between sigh and smile" advancing multiple layers; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops. Minor figurative density in peak ritual taught as pattern without muddle. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan ritual unlocking echo-harvest transforms autonomy trope through dance-threads; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early courtyard to dawn guards. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
