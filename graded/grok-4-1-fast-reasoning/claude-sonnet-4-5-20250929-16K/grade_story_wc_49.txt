<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maera's interiority shines in embodied sensations like the tendril warming and pulsing in her grasp, rooting motivation in tinkering traits; micro-choices like selecting supple tendril and persisting despite cracked voice reveal values. Minor slip: lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, but endurance earns closure change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: songs accumulate harmony, hush deepens to sacred sigh; on-page RR closure in "vine tendrils glowed briefly, gold as the stories... land remembered" with felt cost of incomplete restoration ("seasons, years, generations"). Orientation anchored early; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Verdant arbor sensory-rich (dew-weighted leaves, thrum in bark, arbor's green twilight), filtered via Maera's tinkerer hands; constrains via attuned tendrils and charges final glow/sigh image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore via songs at alignment) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via easier songs, humming harmony, faster pace as moon fades, narrowing to outpouring with ongoing-work cost legible in final reflection. Agency in persistent singing despite vocal limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection via "golden stories" emerges organically from pieced lullabies/songs threading to roots; resonant CR in unnamed magic ("hearts felt suddenly fuller") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in tinkerer noticing ("precise place where old magic thrummed"); rhythmic control modulates hush to sigh, diction purposeful for whimsical magic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short hesitant sentences build to pouring song); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (e.g., tendrils as instruments) propel without overwriting peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer using clockwork mindset on living vines/songs transforms restoration trope; bold subtle magic risks quiet closure effectively.</comment>
