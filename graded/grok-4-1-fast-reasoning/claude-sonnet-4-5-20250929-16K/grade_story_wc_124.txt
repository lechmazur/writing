<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied grief (chest ache, tears only for old vial) reveal contradictory impulses of caution vs. pursuit; lantern broker traits ground micro-choices like UV verification, earning closure realization with felt cost. Dr. Miren's pressure sharpens stakes without overshadowing. Final permission to "carry it" feels character-particular and compelled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from vial setup to blooming climax, landing Conceptual Repricing closure: identical scents but disparate tears reconfigure memory's "shape," with legible emotional cost in "he wept only for the old one." Orientation anchored early (greenhouse, Dalton's profession). One tightening via three-day wait suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse's sterile "mausoleum of extinct blooms" constrains waiting and charges final sunset shadows across glass; UV lamps and pod integrate tactilely via actions (vial glow). Sensory absence (no smells) mirrors loss, filtered through broker's light-shadow bias. Micro-setting vial/glass evolves to hold closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scent-memory link) signaled early, deepens via identical scents' reversal: knowledge shift forecloses literal match, forcing realization with on-page tears/cost. Agency in uncorking test crystallizes under accumulative pressure. Persistent vial constraint shapes tactics to poignant trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of contextual memory emerges organically from scent test to "shape where memory could live," reweighting premise without statement; final vial vs. bloom offers resonant answer via irreplaceable "context: her hands, that morning." Subtext in Miren's tissue gesture layers complexity. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with broker's perceptual signature (light-shadow grammar, scent unmaking); voice modulates rhythmically from quiet reflection to charged closure. Dialogue subtextual (Miren's "trying to understand why you grieve" vs. correction). No head-hopping, diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation; metaphors cohere (lantern glass for memory vessel) without muddle, propelling to closure image of "crystal shadows dance." No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; integrated sensory propulsion via absence/smell bloom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct botany, broker's UV craft, and scent-memory science transforms grief into conceptual lantern; risky accumulative lyricism heightens stakes via identical scents' ironic reversal. Irreplaceable particulars like sterile blooms avoid tropes.</comment>
