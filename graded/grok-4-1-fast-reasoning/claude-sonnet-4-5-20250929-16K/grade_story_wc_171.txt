<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirena's motivation rooted in clipboard ritual compels high-stakes choices like greeting Kordas; contradictory impulses embodied in acknowledging enemies' pain while carving their dead. Final promise earned by prior micro-choices under pressure. Voice distinction clear in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ritual, moons, soils builds to Charged Poise closure in Kordas's promise and Mirena's final addition to clipboard, with cost of "fragile beginning" legible. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ancient terrace, urns, and valleywood seeds constrain ritual choices and charge final image of tending trees. Moons' alignment narrows timing via celestial pressure. Sensory details (silver light, dirt under nails) selective through Mirena's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ritual peace signaled early; accumulative deepening via skepticism ("symbolic gardening") to planting narrows options, forcing stance crystallization in shared kneel. Cost visible in ongoing "tend what we've planted." Agency drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Price of redemption emerges from particulars like mixed soils and carved names, reweighting failures into practice; final image of added date offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Mirena's perceptual signature (ritual as meaning); dialogue subtextual ("muster your humanity") pursues goals distinctly. Rhythm modulates with moons' alignment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel to closure; minor reflection paraphrase ("price of redemption") early but anchors present choices without loop in peak ritual beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual planting transforms war trope; clipboard sketches and soil-mixing inflections grow organically from Mirena's motivation, risking quiet Charged Poise over treaty drama.</comment>
