<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Karim's embodied shift—"something shift inside her chest"—during the sound layering reveals contradictory impulses (protest vs. nod), earning her collaborative choice; bell ringer's traits emerge via precise adjustments without labels dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as corrupted fragments layer into emotional landscape, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing at "first true artificial pilgrimage" with felt cost of overnight reworking and isolation broken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Miner's lens pulses and casts shadows that evolve with sounds, constraining synthesis and charging final image where shadows "dance with the resurrected sounds."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (corruption as loss vs. discovery) tightens texturally via demo's deepening density, forcing Karim's stance shift with visible cost in sustained night work; agency clear in her nod and rebuilding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection via absence emerges organically from sound fragments and lens shadows, resonating in final "reaching hands" without moralizing, though "texture of connection" borders direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Karim with perceptual bias toward sounds; dialogue carries subtext ("What if it was a discovery?") and distinct voices; rhythmic prose modulates from surprise to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in sound descriptions; minor overwriting in metaphors ("water reshaping stone") but no loops dulling closure; variance in sentence length propels to humming lab.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct sounds into "testimony" pilgrimage transforms loss into geography, with lens and bell ringer risking poetic conceit that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
