<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yael's motivation rooted in "balancedly curious" traits compels her surface decision with embodied contradiction (wonder vs. rigor felt in chain link's weight). Interiority concrete via chain handling; Reeves applies relational pressure confirming assignment. Minor label-speak ("somber marvel") slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chain reflection to dialogue tightening resolve, landing CR closure in "navigate when all horizons are unfolding" with conceptual cost of deep-surface divide. Orientation anchored early (dome, Thalassa, Visitors); no lens ambiguity. Final image reweights premise undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chain link as micro-setting constrains reflections and charges closure reprise; dome's "amber light" on rust pits filters through Yael's tactile priorities. Sensory hierarchy vivid (weight, darkness vs. imagined stars); setting subtly guides choice (deep stability vs. surface reconnection). Evolves causally to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (starlight bridge to Visitors' nav) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Reeves dialogue narrowing options (request confirmed). Agency in Yael's endurance of deep "forgetting" for 6-month cost; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconnecting ancestral wisdom emerges organically from chain motif shifting to "unfolded horizons"; final ocean-stars image offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue silences (Reeves' understanding dawns); complexity lingers in humans' "forgotten" maps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (boundaries, light's memory); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to resolute. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're requesting surface assignment"), advances stakes; diction biased to navigation lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "rust-pitted surface caught the dome's amber light" advances setting/character/action). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion breathes with reflective cadence to crisp closure image. Zero scaffold obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: abyssal aliens' "edge geometry" vs. human starlight transforms contact trope via chain's anchor metaphor. Risk in benthic-star pivot heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, voice commits to premise fully.</comment>
