<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist shines in contradictory impulses: obsessive proofs versus balanced endurance, culminating in earned final climb after "rupture" realization with fractured hope as visible cost. Interiority concrete via dice bias and embodied equations; motivation intensifies through missed opportunity haunting choices. Flawless micro-choices reveal values hierarchy without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density of rolls/proofs builds to on-page CR closure where "she could never leave because leaving would break the system" reconfigures options with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early (staircase, mathematician); single scene coherent, no shards. Persistent dice constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains every choice (roll on stone, trace walls, temp shifts dictate predictions) and charges final image of "perpetual and determined" climb. Sensory hierarchy mathematical/POV-specific (chipped edge, point-seven degrees); lived-in via tactile navigation. No white-room; purposeful economy mirrors internal patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove perpetual motion for escape/understanding) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening proofs/rolls narrowing to rupture realization; agency in endurance forecloses escape with "crushing understanding" cost. Pressure coheres texturally, reweighting hope into grim poise. One decisive tightening suffices, legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of regret/prison as perpetual loop emerges organically from dice imperfections and proofs; final CR image ("make each cycle count") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting missed opportunity without moralizing. Subtext in pattern shifts (randomness to conservation); complexity lingers in optimist endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with mathematical perceptual signature (probability cascades, harmonic frequencies); diction/rhythm modulates intensity, compressing under realization stress. Voice distinct, syntax reflects analytical mind; no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels accumulatively; purposeful "perfect" recurrences teach pattern without loops. Minor paraphrase in reflections (e.g., "missed opportunity") doesn't dull closure; read-aloud ear clean, no artifacts in peak "rupture" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math proofs/dice in infinite loop transforms trap trope into conceptual prison; risk in quiet CR climax inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes without gimmickry. Bold non-obvious angle on regret via perpetual motion.</comment>
