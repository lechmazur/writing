<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's contradictory impulses—mourning lost music versus discovering new rhythms—embody in tears and bold gestures, earning her final movement as transformation with visible cost; Celeste's pressure via signing refines Marina's stakes without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds coherently from harbor observation to CR closure in Marina's dance, reconfiguring silence-as-music with emotional cost legible in "joyful sorrow"; orientation anchored early, single scene holds without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harbor's luminous ripples and plank vibrations constrain choices, mirroring internal rhythms and charging final image; selective sensory filter (vibrations felt, wind seen) reflects Marina's Deaf perception without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence to music) signaled early tightens accumulatively via wave mapping to renunciation of past, with agency in camera handling and tears as felt cost; no reversals needed, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence's rhythms emerges from particulars like interfering waves, answered non-literally in final dance reweighting Marina's premise without moralizing; subtext in signing's poetry avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic signing descriptions and visual metaphors; prose rhythm modulates to emotional peaks, signing "dialogue" natural/subtextual, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; metaphors (ripples as interference) coherent and purposeful, peak beats vivid via embodied images like "tears catching moonlight."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Deaf choreography, filmless camera-as-instrument, and silence-as-symphony transforms disability trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via harbor rhythms.</comment>
