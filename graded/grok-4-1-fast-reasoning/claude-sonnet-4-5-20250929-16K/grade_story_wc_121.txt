<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene—searching timelines while hope corrodes—earning the final renunciation; embodied inversion and palm-press reveal character under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: timeline density builds to CR closure ("labyrinth is not conquered but inhabited") with legible cost in "hope corroding"; orientation anchored immediately in inverted viaduct moment, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Viaduct's glow darkening surroundings and periodic manifestation constrain choices (43-day limit pressures decision); final fade charges closure image, sensory hierarchy (rain dripping upward) reflects inverted POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquer self-labyrinth) signaled early, deepens via realization turn narrowing options to acceptance; agency in yielding to gravity forecloses endless retracing with felt cost in fractured completeness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from timeline particulars to resonant CR ("She was it, and it was her"); final image reweights infinite recursion without moralizing, ambiguity lingers in periodic return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in inverted observations ("rainwater dripping upward") and timeline flickers; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, stable close-third POV enhances surreal immersion without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; opening ("rainwater dripping upward") and final line ("wouldn't need to retrace") recharge motifs propulsively, purposeful compression suits lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural timelines and inverted viaduct transforms multiverse trope into self-labyrinth; bold surreal commitment (falling upward) heightens stakes inevitably toward CR without gimmickry.</comment>
