<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in shaking hands while cutting wires compel the release; final transformation earned via progressive micro-choices with identity cost. Interiority particular via circuitous speech orbiting truths, shown not told. Mrs. Chen's comment forces clarifying correction, revealing growth even in directness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm pattern break initiates density increase in observations/releases, culminating in CR closure with nursery's wild flourishing reweighting control premise; cost legible in "shedding skin he wasn't sure he could live without." Two shards (post-storm release to weeks of change) transition legibly; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and linden branches constrain release action, evolve from rigid pain to gentle chaos charging final image; selective sensory detail (droplets, lacework edge) mirrors internal flexibility. Wild back-corner plants contrast ordered rows purposefully. Recurrent rain/trellis post-storm ties to sustaining transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. surrender) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via storm survivors' observation narrowing to wire-cutting; agency in releases forecloses old identity path with unruly nursery cost. Mrs. Chen pressures sprawl, forcing stance clarification under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of growth-through-surrender emerges via storm-wild plants motif shifting from threat to model, resonant in final nursery partnership image reweighting premise without moral. Imperfect leaf reprise concretizes acceptance of chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: plant behaviors filtered obsessively yet yielding to wonder. Voice texture mirrors circuitous sincerity in narration ("his words taking the long route"); dialogue subtextual—correction to Mrs. Chen advances arc. Rhythmic modulation breathes with reluctant shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/reflection without loops; varied syntax propels from post-storm poise to weeks' cadence shift. Minor synonym churn in "control" references contained, not obscuring closure. Final line recharges trellis image crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nursery as identity crucible transforms control trope via plant agency (wild survivors dictate shift). Risk in quiet, storm-seasoned arc heightens stakes organically; linden's pained beauty to chaos feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
