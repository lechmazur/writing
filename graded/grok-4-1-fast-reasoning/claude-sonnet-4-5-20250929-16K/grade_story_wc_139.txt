<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—father's ink pot as talisman against forgery yet prompting nuanced action—act simultaneously in her refusal to forge then decision to wait, earning the closure choice with visible ethical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as waiting density reconfigures honesty via SD card discovery; CR closure lands in Mira documenting truth ("one brother reclaiming his sister's final testimony"), with cost legible in Pavel's fear and her rigid shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prep room's drainage during "routine examination" constrains discovery, charging final image; ink pot recurs as micro-setting mirroring Mira's internal liquidity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Pavel's asylum via swallowed evidence) tightens via Mira's agency in active waiting and truthful documentation, forcing ethical trade-off with felt cost in "uncomfortable mathematics."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of ink pot, Elena's vitality, and city "seeking asylum" offers resonant non-literal answer to honesty-necessity convergence, reweighting math metaphors without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mira's forgery lens ("manipulate truth like clay") and rhythmic modulation under waiting pressure; dialogue subtext-laden (Pavel's "How do I repay this?") advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives ("liquefied under prison's harsh chemistry") propels without loops; varied rhythm peaks in discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embalming routine and swallowed microSD transforms con artist inheritance into ethical nuance, with risk-taking in quiet CR closure heightening stakes.</comment>
