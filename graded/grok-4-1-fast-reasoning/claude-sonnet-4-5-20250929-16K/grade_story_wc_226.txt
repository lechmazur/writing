<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Defiant artist's motivation rooted in traits intensifies through poetry micro-choices under judgment pressure, with internal conflict embodied in verse vs. exhaustion; final acceptance earned by prior failed refractions, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density builds to CR closure ("the canyon had not scattered her truth. It had amplified it"), with legible cost in undivided truth's weight; single scene oriented early, one tightening via dawn realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain poetry tactic and charge final spire image, with sensory details (smooth ivory, reverberating whispers) filtered through artist's defiant gaze; setting evolves causally from mist-shrouded to revealed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy via refraction) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through layered verses to deepening realization narrowing options; agency in poetry forecloses evasion path, but cost legibility peaks slightly abstract in final hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of singular truth vs. multiplicity emerges organically from poetry refractions amplifying core guilt, with final image ("Mira walked toward it") offering resonant CR answer without moralizing; complexity in art's intention/consequence lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in artistic noticing (towers as "broken fingers"); rhythmic prose modulates from tentative verse to forged hush, apt for lyric accumulative drive; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short echo fragments vs. longer realizations), no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in opening ("accumulated guilt") purposeful but risks slight overwrite without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo canyon as judgment instrument transforms artist-defiance trope, with poetry refraction turning inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in acoustic motif heightens stakes organically.</comment>
