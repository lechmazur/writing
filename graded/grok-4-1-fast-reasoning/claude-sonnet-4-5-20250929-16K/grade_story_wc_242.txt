<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Iris's motivation to facilitate reconnections is concrete and consistent, shown through micro-choices like noting details and dialing one digit off; interiority emerges via grandmother's heirloom anchoring her work. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses or flawed struggle under pressure, reading as competent idealism without embodied crisis. No pivotal micro-choice reveals value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of calls taught in first call ("Three years was a long silence") builds density to her interventions on seventh night, yielding CR closure in "The loop was endless... copper thread of hello" with conceptual cost of endless delicate labor. Orientation anchors early (phone booth in tunnel). No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel and glass disc constrain choices (keeps it "running," wet finger traces rim) and charge final image ("tunnel sang"); sensory details (prismatic shadows, hum of streetlamps) selective via Iris's priorities. Micro-setting (disc as tool) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent in single location.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate/resolve estrangements) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via call density to her agency in dialing ("one digit off"), narrowing to "never force" with felt cost of bootleg bills and risk. One tightening sufficient; closure crystallizes stance. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-interventions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of estrangement as transformable loop emerges from particulars (gardens, plumber, pizzeria); final image ("Someone, somewhere, dialed... waited") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting "goodbye" premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and wrong numbers; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (music "travels through cracks"); stable third-person close, no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual ("Wrong number... Right place"). Rhythm modulates with intensity, prose as character in haunted melody texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy lines at calls, flowing descriptions); intentional loop motif purposeful, no paraphrase churn. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("melodically haunted notes through... veins") near closure but doesn't obscure. Propulsion clear, read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obsolete phone booth, glass harmonica, and wrong-number reconnections transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens endless-loop stakes. Premise inevitable in hindsight via grandmother cue; no derivatives.</comment>
