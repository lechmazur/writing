<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied contradiction like "familiar bite of jealousy reading it," driving micro-choices to chronicle despite haunting past selves; final endurance of writing earns closure with visible cost of eternal fragmentation. Minor diagnostic label "jaded wonder" slightly abstracts peak emotion without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of time impossibilities tightening to CR closure in "She picked up another strip of bark," reweighting chaos as chronicle-worthy with undeniable cost of shattered linearity; orientation anchors early in cabin/scroll without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Birch bark and cabin sap/smoke constrain chronicling choices tactilely; lamp's paradoxical "burned on, or had already burned out" charges final image, mirroring internal chaos through selective sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to distill chaos signaled in opening scroll, deepens accumulatively through examples like grave memory narrowing options to persistence; cost legible in "exhaustion that comes from being amazed by horror," charging poised endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of narrative need amid time chaos emerges organically from particulars like shuffled scrolls; final ghost/awe image resonantly reweights feral nostalgia without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of eternal present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature of time metaphors ("tangled fishing line"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in cramped notation beats without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in "Theory 47" block; purposeful time loops like "dawn or dusk" teach pattern without artifacts, though minor metaphor density ("origami," "fishing line") risks slight overload pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of personal chronology via grave-as-memory transforms time trope organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, culminating in awe/ghost reconfiguration inevitable from prior density.</comment>
