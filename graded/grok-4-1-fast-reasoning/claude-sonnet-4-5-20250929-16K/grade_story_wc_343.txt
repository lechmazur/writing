<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's diligently curious trait drives concrete micro-choices like compass placement and symbol-matching, earning reversal act; embodied isolation in "sociable isolation" reveal particularizes without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from hopscotch spacing to phrasebook match to boot reversal delivers on-page Decisive Change; ship's shudder as cost legible in "deck tilt," lens holds firmly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brass hull, planking nail holes, and starling shadows constrain pattern discovery and charge final descent image; sensory hierarchy cartographer-specific, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant escape stake tightens via pattern hypothesis forcing unpermitted action; causal agency peaks in reversal with visceral shudder cost narrowing stasis option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sociable isolation theme emerges organically from crew proximity amid pattern obsession, reweighted in journal notation without moral; final image answers discovery via charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Maren-limited POV with perceptual signature in geometric noticing; Captain's "knee joints popping" dialogue distinct, subtext presses hypothesis naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in reversal beat ("dragged her boot backward through the chalk, scraping from eight to one"); varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffolds propel to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-map transforms stranded-ship trope via polyglot symbols into geometric release; reversal payoff inevitable from early patterns, bold yet coherent risk.</comment>
