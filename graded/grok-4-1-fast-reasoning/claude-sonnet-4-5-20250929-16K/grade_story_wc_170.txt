<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via borrowed heartbeat pulsing purpose, driving micro-choices in songs; final reconfiguration earned through embodied longing cracking voice yet persisting, with contradictory calm/ferocity acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions tightens to RR/CR closure in smallest mirror's vision dissolving after three heartbeats, reconfiguring grief with felt exhaustion cost on wet stone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism parapet gleams post-rain, splitting light into ribbons that constrain mirror ritual and charge visions; tactile wet flagstones, echoing terrace integrate purposefully, mirroring internal prismatic hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mirror persuasion for possibilities) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intensifying coded songs/visions narrowing to final shimmer-then-dissolve; agency in persistent singing forecloses grief path with legible exhaustion price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of possibilities over grief emerges organically from visions/mirrors; final studio image offers resonant non-literal answer to "what if" questions, reweighting borrowed heartbeat without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature painterly/musical (prism ribbons dancing, notes as caress/command); rhythmic modulation heightens hush-before-bells pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax/rhythm; minor figurative density (indigo/amber ribbons) purposeful and pattern-taught via light motif, no loops, clear propulsion to final wrapping.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coded lullabies/mirrors for what-ifs transforms grief trope; risk-taking in ritual causality/lyric closure feels inevitable, heightened by heartbeat constraint on tactics.</comment>
