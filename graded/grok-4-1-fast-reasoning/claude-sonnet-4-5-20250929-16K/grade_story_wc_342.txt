<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia as blind spot drives parallel to monk's fractal failure, with micro-choices like measuring canvas and photographing coin revealing hierarchy of values; earned endurance in final portrait decision shows contradiction between blindness and faith without tidy epiphany. Interiority particular and embodied from opening fingertips on canvas.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: letter cues discovery chain to coin, culminating in CR closure via coin warming and wrecking ball swing reweighting infinite approximation with conceptual cost of noble futility; no orientation debt, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tree library's sap-weeping alcoves and external demolition equipment constrain time-bound discovery and charge final image as wrecking ball swings; sensory details (sap, diesel cough) filter through artist's precise gaze, mirroring fractal theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher hidden infinite before dawn) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through coin's layers narrowing to asymptotic realization; cost legible in tree's fall foreclosing guild's walls yet persistence reconfigures stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of finite mirroring infinite emerges from particulars like prosopagnosia paintings and fractal coin, resonant non-literal answer in coin's warmth repricing attempts as transformative without moralizing; no thematic echo despite journal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of component-measuring (e.g., "eyes here, mouth there"); rhythmic prose modulates from precise observation to charged poise at "wrecking ball took its first swing," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax (e.g., short predawn stillness sentences build to longer fractal realizations); no loops or artifacts, metaphors consistent (asymptotic curves) without muddle in peak ending beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prosopagnosia artist decoding fractal coin transforms trope of doomed quest into noble futility; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes via demolition countdown without gimmick.</comment>
