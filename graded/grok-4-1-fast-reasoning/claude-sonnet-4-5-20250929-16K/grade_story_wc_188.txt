<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to defy hopelessness roots consistently in traits like chanting and ambient awareness, compelling higher-stakes fireworks launch; interiority concrete via "ambient awareness" sensing sickness. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; competence dominates without deep blind-spot mistakes compounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mosaic discovery to sky messages stirring fortress, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("fortress had changed... cracked, letting light seep through") with felt cost of partial transformation. Orientation anchored early at dusk arrival; single scene progression coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonflowers and mosaic constrain choices (drooping blossoms signal sickness, mosaic reveals message driving launch); final reprise of moonflowers closing as fortress "truly bloomed" charges closure image. Sensory details selective via POV (moonflowers "crawled," "white faces"), mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via commander's doubt then sky-stirring bursts narrowing to partial victory; agency in launches forecloses total transformation path with legible cost. Single decisive intensification sufficient, but lacks persistent constraint visibly altering multiple tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of manufactured hope emerges organically from mosaic note ("make your own") to sky poetry resolving central question non-literally; final image reweights particulars (phoenixes, blooming) without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like "serious playfulness" enriches without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (chant-filtered awareness); voice rhythmic and biased toward light motifs. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Pretty words"—commander tests stakes); minor register elevation in descriptions but consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., launch sequence varies rhythm); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak fireworks beat. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly; figurative language purposeful, not overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fireworks writing messages transforms trope of light-in-darkness via mosaic priming and ambient filtering; risk in sky-as-mosaic synthesis feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically (+0.3 for bold reconfiguration).</comment>
