<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "instincts screamed at her to surface" vs. acting, earning the closure choice with embodied tremble and calculation; Thalia's gestures pressure without dominating. Minor slip in Marina's swift expertise feels lightly convenient but doesn't touch pivotal override. Final micro-choice reveals values hierarchy with temple cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds from signal to vial transfer ("aligned the probe... triggered") causing DC closure with legible cost ("free you or kill you"); single scene anchors orientation early ("descended into the trench"). No shards or ambiguity; lens causal throughout to temple collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Submersible tools ("manipulator arms", "energy probe") constrain choices and charge vial's "facets catching lights"; sensory hierarchy narrows to "fading patterns" under crisis. Temple "coral-encrusted pillars" mirrors isolation, evolving to rubble payoff. Micro-object vial as setting recharges final ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free Thalia pre-failure) tightens via memories' urgency, forcing agency in override and trigger; causal escalation narrows to "precise moment when weakest." Cost visible in risk dialogue and collapse; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserved memory emerges via vial's "sunlight on the city... final hope," reweighting isolation in final "refused to be forgotten" without statement. Vial shifts from key to heart-held resonance; counter-reading (loss of temple) adds complexity. CR lands non-literal in ascent to stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in technical "trajectories, power ratios"; rhythm modulates from wonder ("chest ache") to urgency. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Please"); no head-hopping, diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in climax ("energy coruscated... spirals of blue and gold") propels without loops or muddle; rhythm varies (short gasps vs. flowing ascent). No scaffolds, strong verbs dominate; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi preservation and ancient temple via vial's "captured time"; transforms lost-city trope through temporal transfer risk. Bold underwater ascent reconfigures lonesome isolation organically, no hedging.</comment>
