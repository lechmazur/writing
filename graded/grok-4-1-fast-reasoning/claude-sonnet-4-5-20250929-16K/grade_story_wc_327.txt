<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in obsession versus inevitable solitude act through her refinements; final endurance of encoding despite no decoder earned by prior isolation cues like brother's death. Copper veins and articulate precision embodied consistently. No safety-hedging in her flawed acceptance of sanity's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from diamond test to bird insight to encoding library, culminating in CR closure where final press reconfigures language's death into tactile endurance with legible sanity cost ("paid a fair price"). Orientation anchored early in tower/canyon. One tightening via birds narrows to control.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bone towers and canyon echoes constrain choices as encoding surfaces and mirror theme; recurring diamond/flock charge final image of press against bone. Sensory tactile focus (ridges/pores) reflects linguistic POV bias. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (encode dying language) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bird-pattern deepening that alters tactics to complex encoding. Cost legible in sanity/solitude; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in smile/press. Protagonist agency drives without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation (sound to texture) emerges from particulars like "nethara" harmonic; final image offers resonant CR repricing of death as endurance without moral. Subtext in echoes/textures lingers with ambiguity of undecoded future. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in textural/linguistic noticing (e.g., "microscopic ridges and pores"). Rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure; purposeful compression taught early via diamond mechanics. No leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "flaw was not a weakness but a tunnel" advances concept/character); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Propulsion aligns with reflective escalation; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic preservation via flawed diamond/bird patterns feels inevitable; bold textural encoding transforms dying-language trope. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
