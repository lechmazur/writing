<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's wistful yet strategically creative nature drives concrete micro-choices like threading the reel and playing his hidden composition, earning the final renunciation of crowd-pleasers with embodied resolve. Internal conflict between invisibility and determination shows in "refusing to collapse into sentimentality" during the climax play. Minor label-speak in "wistful by nature, always imagining" slightly abstracts early traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from reel projection to arbor play, culminating in Charged Poise RR via the clock ticking to 11:48, reconfiguring time/invisibility with felt cost of prior overlooked years. Orientation anchors pianist at Grand Central by para 1; two-shard structure (station-arbor-station) fits scope with legible transitions. Closure cost legible in "he felt different now, solid somehow, as though the music had welded his scattered pieces together."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal arbor's sideways trees and silver leaves constrain climax timing/play, charging final image; clock as recurring micro-setting evolves from frozen to ticking. Sensory details like "branches wept silver leaves that dissolved into mist" filter through Marcus's musical perception. Station compasses subtly guide choice to wall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping invisibility tightens accumulatively as compasses/reel pull him through, deepening in arbor play where islands sync to rhythm, forcing stance crystallization before sunset. Cost felt in liminal refuge's fade and "grinding disappointment"; agency in entering/playing forecloses passive life. Minor abstractness in declared stakes early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of surprising fate emerges organically from clock/motifs shifting to affirm self-creation, resonant in final "Tomorrow, he would play only his own compositions" reweighting invisibility without moralizing. Compasses recharging as "fixed point" ties particulars to earned defiance. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in "encore enough" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in musical metaphors like "frozen in their circular dance"; diction/rhythm modulates from station bustle to arbor lyricism under sunset pressure. No head-hopping; elision of arbor mechanics taught via reel/projection. Voice distinct, biasing toward steely precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "His music filled the arbor with steely longing, each note precise and determined" propelling via varied rhythm/syntax; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in arbor descriptors ("floating islands of earth that rose and fell like breathing") risks figurative density but stays coherent/voice-motivated. Propulsion peaks cleanly at clock tick.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of station pianist trope via film-reel portals to tidal arbor piano transforms invisibility into magical self-assertion; risk-taking in arbor surrealism heightens stakes organically. Final compasses-follow-home inflects ingenuity, feeling inevitable from reel/compass setup without gimmickry.</comment>
