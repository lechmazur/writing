<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's luminous skepticism and realistic imagination drive contradictory impulses, culminating in patient shard placement that earns her glow's fade as visible cost at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as shard discoveries build pattern-key for box; RR closure lands on-page with Mara's fading glow as cost in "The box dissolved in her hands."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fountains constrain via shard locations and constellation map, charging final image as water flows; selective details like "stone basins collecting only leaves" filter through Mara's dawn glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to free trapped emotions deepens via accumulating shards narrowing to sidereal puzzle; agency in placement forces trade-off, cost legible in glow's fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient bridging via doubt emerges implicitly; final "singing fountains" and geese honk reweight premise of frozen pause without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of "realistic imagination"; rhythm modulates in "deliberate slowness that celestial bodies teach" under climax pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High-density propulsion with zero loops; climax lines like "from within poured the stolen emotions" multi-task image, release, and thematic recharge without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geese-pause anomaly and emotion-trapping via forgetting transform quest trope; sidereal shard puzzle risks bold conceptual synthesis, inevitable in closure.</comment>
