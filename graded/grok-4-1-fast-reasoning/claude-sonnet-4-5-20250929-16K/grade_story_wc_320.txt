<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in persistent search intensifies to compel tuning shift; interiority concrete in skin-charge sensation and breath-catch at hush bloom. Crystallization earned by prior months' contrast, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via signal density to hush bloom; CR closure in "understanding crystallized" reconfigures prior interference with conceptual cost of discarded assumptions legible in final recording intent. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via valley-tuning suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower sway and gorge shadow constrain isolated listening; fragment and moonlight selectively sharpen cosmic focus, charging final dawn fade into morning noise image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode hush signaled early, deepens accumulatively via assumption-discard to knowledge reweight; agency in re-tuning forecloses prior methods with felt cost in transformed perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Endings-as-beginnings emerges implicitly from hush overriding noise; final frequency-shift image offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature biases toward cosmic whispers and stellar facets; syntax rhythmically modulates from setup hum to inverse-symphony peak without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in fragment-pulse sequence; minor repetition of ending-phrase echoes purposeful but borders loop in reflective blocks, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh celestial-iron salvage and hush-as-message synthesis feels inevitable; bold lyric solo-POV risks heighten cosmic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
