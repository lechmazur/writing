<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Solid interiority through embodied serenity and micro-choices like tilting shutters precisely; motivation consistent and intensifies via ongoing commitment. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure—no visible internal struggle in pivotal pattern-weaving beats. Endurance at end feels earned but serene without raw cost exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns builds to RR closure in lingering images and gentler whispers, with perpetual task as felt cost ("work...never truly be finished"). Single scene anchored early (dock, Lira by ~50 words). No orientation debt; lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shutters and mirror as micro-setting constrain choices (tilted for light) and charge final image (patterns linger). Sensory details selective via POV (ripples, glimmers); wet planks tactile, rain-slick cobalt dock mirrors calm. Environment evolves causally with actions, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soothe canal tension) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shifting patterns as "hour grew late." Agency in weaving light forecloses void's dominance with ongoing cost legible. Pressure low-key situational; fisherman and cat complicate mildly but no sharp option-narrowing reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy/light in darkness emerges organically via refracted patterns and canal's softening, reweighting premise in final lingering image without statement. Subtext in silence as "bridge" and cat's understanding adds resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity in perpetual return invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: calm, pattern-focused noticing (ripples, glimmers). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, diction biased to serenity (ivy, lullaby). Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("What are you doing?"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in pattern dance, longer reflections); high density integrates action/image. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("bruise on glass") coherent but elevated; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dental mirror/shutters weave light for canal's "stars," transforming guardian trope into poetic ritual. Risk in abstract stakes paid via concrete tools; feels inevitable in hindsight, no derivative echoes.</comment>
