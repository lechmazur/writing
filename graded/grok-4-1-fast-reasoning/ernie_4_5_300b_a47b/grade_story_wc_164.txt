<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of cheerful gloom act in scene via humming amid sighs and pressing seeds despite regret's weight; final realization earned by shard-seed interplay with visible conceptual cost of release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard transliteration to pool images forming CR closure; "Lira’s breath caught. She saw the truth now" delivers on-page repricing with undeniable conceptual cost of painful release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode's pulsing walls and liquid light pool constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details like bioluminescent glow and dew-glistening seeds mirror internal states through goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover path disappearance tightens accumulatively via seed-shard fusion narrowing to pool revelation; agency in conjecturing aloud forces stance crystallization with felt cost of acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of releasing painful paths emerges organically from dissolving shard-seeds yielding non-literal final images; resonant reconfiguration reweights "unremembered" premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (tide-washed perceptions, prismatic whispers); rhythmic control heightens insight at pool without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density (e.g., "molasses left too long in the sun") borders overwriting in early beats without obscuring closure; no loops dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recollectionist geode-world with seed-map mechanics transforms memory tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive to CR feels inevitable in pool dissolution.</comment>
