<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied curiosity drives micro-choices like pressing the hearing aid to the photo, with motivation rooted in protecting voices; internal conflict mild as no strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the climax sync moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to Charged Poise closure in the mist parting and final beep; cost legible in the man's relieved pulse steadying and woman's tear after delivery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist and atrium labyrinth constrain path through west wing, charging final exhale image; sensory selection (damp moss, violet light, pulse thrum) selective via Lila's priorities, evolves causally with mist parting at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing/assuring the heart tightens via unusual pulse through photo to sync; agency in following pulse forecloses inaction with felt emotional cost in throat tightening and final silent pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges organically from pulse-tracking to delivery, resonating in non-literal final realization "stories weren’t meant to end. They were meant to echo" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in mist/filtered details; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, dialogue sparse but natural/subtextual in "But he meant it."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (mist like spectral cats) integrated into action; minor overwriting in stacked images around piano/vase slightly slows but no loops or artifacts touch closure beep.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of supernatural detection via hearing aid pulses transforms ghost story into quiet heroism; risk in poetic mist-agency heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via photo clue payoff.</comment>
