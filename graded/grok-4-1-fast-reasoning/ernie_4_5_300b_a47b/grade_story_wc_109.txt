<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's obsession drives consistent micro-choices like ignoring the groaning walls and persisting through aching fingers, earning the final completion. Interiority embodied in tactile details (tracing cracks, quill strokes). Minor slip in abstract epiphany ("Let the map be imperfect") borders unearned but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of summarized silences builds to CR closure as map glows post-star extinction, with cost in shedding flakes legible at "gold flakes began to shed." Orientation anchored early (Mara at fort, post-storm). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fort's crumbling archway and gusts constrain choices (crouches in lee, pebbles skitter), charging final image as map light seeps into cracks. Sensory hierarchy fits oracle bias (hushes over visuals). Micro-setting (quill, vial) tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (draw endless night map) signaled early, escalates via deepening hush and resistance (paper resists, walls groan), narrowing to final flourish. Agency in endurance forecloses perfection path with flake-shedding cost. Lens-appropriate density reweights void as illuminable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as palimpsest emerges organically via ink strokes peeling layers, resonant CR in glowing map reweighting absence as presence without moral. Final image ("light seeping into the cracks") non-literal answer to mapping void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature oracle-specific (hushes as language). Rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences in gust interruption). Purposeful elision of backstory taught early, paid in scroll roll-up.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "lines emerged hesitantly, as if the paper itself resisted"). Rhythmic variety, no loops despite hush recurrence (pattern-taught). Minor mixed metaphors ("marbled hush," "ambered hush") coherent in voice, don't muddle closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: oracle maps stellar labyrinth via silence summaries, transforming absence trope into illuminator. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens conceptual stakes. No derivative echoes.</comment>
