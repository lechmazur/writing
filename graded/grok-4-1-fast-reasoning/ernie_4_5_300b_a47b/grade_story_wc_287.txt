<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's wistfully pragmatic motivation roots deeply in his gardener identity and intensifies through concrete actions like tapping the gauge and opening the window; Mara's wariness-to-softening arc earns closure via their finger-brush and her letting light in. Internal conflict emerges subtly in his resolve against harbor darkness without alternating summaries. Minor flaw: brief stock phrasing like "hearts that had forgotten how to soften" dilutes particularity but doesn't touch pivotal shop moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from fire escape reflection to dock tapping to shop humming, culminating in Charged Poise RR as Mara closes eyes to light with felt relational cost. Orientation anchors Elias/harbor immediately. One meaningful tightening: shift from solitary rhythm to shared hum with Mara forecloses isolation. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor and bait shop constrain choices—dock for rhythmic tapping, shuttered window opened to flood light, charging final image. Sensory details (salt/diesel, chill water, stale air) filter through Elias's gardener POV, mirroring internal light/dark. Micro-setting of gauge on sill guides humming action. Recurring moonlight evolves from cold to flooding, tensing tone purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reflect light into dark) signals early and tightens accumulatively via dock beat then shop entry, narrowing to Mara's stance crystallization with vulnerability cost. Agency in Elias's persistent offering forces her trade-off, legible in hesitation-to-step-aside. Pressure coheres texturally without reversal overload; cost felt in her years-dimmed shop breached.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of persistence post-loss emerges organically from petal-drop frame, gauge-as-light-measure, and final hum reweighting gloom to potential bloom. Subtext in silences/gestures (finger-brush, eyes closed) invites ambiguity without sermonizing. Final harbor-mist image offers non-literal resonance to "water the stem" question. No Thematic Echo despite direct motivation line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with lyrical perceptual signature (jasmine leaves, wave whispers) modulates rhythmically under resolve; no head-hopping. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual—Mara's rough "Why?" pursues evasion before yielding. Prose texture distinct in syntax variety, fitting wistful pragmatism. Psychic distance tightens aptly at shop climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tapping the gauge against the sill" advances rhythm/action/character); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion breathes with scene. Minor paraphrase loop in "rhythm" phrasing (-0.3) but purposeful pattern taught early. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors in peak shop beat; clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms mundane lockpick tool into light-measuring talisman, ingeniously paralleling gardener precision with emotional persistence. Tropes of quiet redemption personalized via harbor micro-world and oar-rhythm method. Risky lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative templates, feels inevitable hindsight via rosebush frame.</comment>
