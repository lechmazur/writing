<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied emotions peak concretely in "breath caught" and "pulse quickened" during heat-mapper activation, driving micro-choices; motivation to voice the unknown compels higher-stakes touch of fossil. Final reconfiguration earned via spore absorption mirroring her journey. Minor slip in smooth emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tracing fossil to holographic journey to spore cloud, yielding CR closure in "fossil crumbled to dust" with conceptual cost of fulfilled purpose reweighting her role. Orientation anchored immediately in cave chamber. One tightening via floating leaf suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coastal cave constrains via tides "carved secrets" and "guarded it," charging final climb; bioluminescent algae and damp sand tactilely mirror internal wonder. Sensory hierarchy reflects mapper's bias toward emotional residues. Recurring fossil as micro-setting recharges ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decipher fossil signaled early, tightens accumulatively at floating dissolution narrowing to personal absorption with felt cost in crumbling artifact. Agency in tool activation and algae touch forecloses inert mapping for translation. Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of persistent stories emerges organically via leaf's palimpsest vision mirroring Lira's shift, reweighted non-literally in golden spores seeping "sharp and clarifying." Avoids moralizing; resonance from particulars like emotional gradients. Final image answers "voice of unknown" with charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via sensory tools like "crimson where fear pooled"; rhythm modulates from descriptive to urgent in white light blur. No head-hopping; diction purposeful without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/atmosphere as in hologram projection; rhythm varies without loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphor density at spore swirl purposeful for textural lens, not muddling closure. No artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation emotional cartography transforms fossil trope via heat-mapping into portal; risk in "factually mystical" aura pays off in spore reconfiguration. Premise commits without retreat, hindsight inevitable.</comment>
