<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's blindness enables unique touch-based perception, embodied in "traced the colors with her fingertips," driving micro-choices like basin submersion; Marlow applies pressure via diagnosis. Internal endurance of her method against logic feels earned. Minor smoothness in emotional progression prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: malfunction → basin diagnosis → patch → test success → ship launch as Charged Poise closure with ongoing work cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in depot/ship context. One tightening at servo revelation narrows options cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Basin as micro-setting constrains diagnosis ("ripples distorted the light") and charges final image ("water’s surface catching the faint glow of dawn"). Mist, chains, skylight filter through Lira's tactile bias, evolve causally. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under repair urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix drone pre-launch) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at "feedback loop’s corrupted," forcing recalibration with felt time cost in dawn whir. Agency in patch endures visible trade-off. No live option foreclosed sharply enough for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of alternative "seeing" emerges via water light, hummingbirds, ending in Marlow's "listening’s a kind of seeing" as resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in her shrug invites reflection. Particulars like basin whispers avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited with blind perceptual signature ("feel the drone’s balance"); voice modulates rhythm in hum/melody beat. Dialogue distinct—Marlow's grunts vs. Lira's murmur—carries subtext. Minor filter in "watched through the mist" unneeded but voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; basin submersion integrates action/image seamlessly. Slight paraphrase loop in repair steps ("submerged...removed, dried") and mist motifs (-0.3), but no closure touch. Read-aloud propulsion strong in launch whir.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: blind artisan's water-refraction for hummingbird drones transforms repair trope organically. Risk in tactile sci-fi world logic heightens stakes without gimmick. Final basin reprise feels inevitable.</comment>
