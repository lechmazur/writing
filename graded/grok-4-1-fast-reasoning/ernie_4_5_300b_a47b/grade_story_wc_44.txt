<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving patient study to breakthrough, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the pivotal insertion moment; competence dominates without genuine flaws complicating the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with studies therefore theory therefore alignment therefore insertion yielding CR closure; cost legible in "gateway to a realm where time flowed backward" reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory's shifting constellations and dais slot constrain alignment choice; floating isle's thinning veil and shadow direction charge final revelation image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens via approaching alignment window narrowing options; protagonist agency in adjusting telescopes and inserting key forecloses prior uncertainty with felt rush cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden cycles emerges organically from key gears mirroring stars to closing loop; final image of condensed shadows offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting shadows' mystery without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with scholarly perceptual bias in "gears polished to a mirror sheen" and rune-focused noticing; rhythmic control modulates from deliberate buildup to humming climax without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates setting into action (e.g., "hurried to adjust the telescopes"); varied rhythm propels to whirring gears, minor paraphrase in study summaries ("months... three nights") dings propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spoons catalyst, celestial key, and noon shadows into inevitable loop-closing revelation; risk in backward-time gateway heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
