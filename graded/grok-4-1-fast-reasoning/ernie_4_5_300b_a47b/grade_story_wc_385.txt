<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via frayed song to purpose realization; interiority embodied in breath catching and melancholy swelling. Final endurance to sing heavy stories earned by causal ascent. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more stated than acted in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from shell hum to stone voice to summit images, yielding CR closure where canyon answers Kael's song with felt purpose cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening at fissure revelation narrows knowledge. Cost legible in "stories too heavy, too painful, to fade."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (hum, wind whispers, stone fissures) filters through Kael's perceptual bias, constraining ascent and charging summit circle. Environment mirrors internal fray via "torn hole in fabric"; choreography coherent. Recurring stones/shell constrain final revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn echo origins) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shell-guided revelations forcing realization trade-off. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in singing back; agency in ascent/presses. Cost unmistakable in flashing painful images and heavy stories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of echoes as trapped memories emerges organically via shell/stone events, images, and figure's reveal, reweighting premise in final canyon answer without moralizing. Subtext in lingering ripples vs. silence invites ambiguity. Resonant non-literal close: "canyon sing back—not in echo, but in answer."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (canyon secrets, symbol deciphering); poetic diction/rhythm modulates from melancholy ascent to summit intensity. Dialogue natural/subtextual, advances revelation. No head-hopping; voice distinct in "reed-blown melancholy."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, syntax purposeful in poetic texture without monotony. Minor overwriting in metaphor density (serpentine coils, webs) purposeful for accumulative tone, not obscuring closure. No loops/artifacts; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo folklore with perceptual shell/singing in living nexus transforms fantasy tropes via grounded ascent/revelation. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: shell ascent yields memory-proof CR.</comment>
