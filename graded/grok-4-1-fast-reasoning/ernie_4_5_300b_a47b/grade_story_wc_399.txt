<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—serenity amid scars, honest laugh disarming the prophet—act in the mask-falling beat, earning her endurance as line walker with visible relational cost in his recoil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prophet's arrival seeds density of hums/glows/shudders building to "clearings stabilized" RR closure with sweat and exposure as felt cost in final consecration beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet constrains choices by shuddering/responding/glowing/rising in consecration, charging final settled pattern image; sensory integration (hum, smoke-voices) mirrors internal states without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echo) signaled early tightens via prophet amplification and mask fall, forcing trade-off in exposure; cost legible in sweat and recoiled reaction during parapet surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honest endurance walking unseen lines emerges from mask fall and stabilized clearings; final "line would endure" reweights prior consecration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Mara with perceptual bias (peripheral clearings); dialogue subtextual ("Your honesty is disarming") advances goals; rhythmic diction modulates from hum to silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory propulsion; minor −0.4 for parapet "shuddered" loop (opening/ending) and synonym churn on dunes/pavilion hums dulling slight momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of peripheral conjurings and kinetic response transforms mystic tropes; risk in "strangely honest" mask reveal heightens personal stakes organically.</comment>
