<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's sentinel role and motivation to nurture understanding drive gentle nudges like sharing the letter, earning Lila's shift from numbness; Lila's block shows embodied (hunched shoulders, abandoned easel) with contradictory engagement. Minor slip in tidy epiphany ("small, wry thing, but genuine") lacks deeper embodied cost. Voice distinction clear in dialogue idioms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from isolation to walk/dialogue tightening Lila's stake, closing in Charged Poise RR ("imperfect dance") with felt cost of accepting mismatch over harmony. Orientation anchored early (pavilion, vineyard, post-bus). Single scene/shard fits defaults; letter prop links causally without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vineyard's acidic soil/rain/frost parallel theme, constraining walk and charging raindrop closure image; sensory hierarchy (grape tang, leaf crunch) filters via Elias's watchful bias. Weather evolves to patter/laughter, mirroring internal thaw. No generic placeholders; micro-setting (oak, pavilion) guides choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lila's numbness vs. feeling via imbalance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via letter-sharing and fragments to stance crystallization (smiles, laughs); agency in Lila's abrupt stand/walk forecloses perfect-match pursuit with relational cost. One tightening sufficient; cost legible in "forgotten" easel and lighter steps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mismatch beauty emerges organically from sun/moon letter, vineyard thriving in imbalance, to final "imperfect dance" reweighting harmony pursuit without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures (traces edges, tucks letter); resonant image answers central question non-literally. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV (Elias-dominant, clean Lila focalization in walk) with perceptual signature (reflective, watchful); dialogue natural/subtextual ("chasing ghosts" vs. "chasing harmony"), advances via persuasion. Prose texture modulates rhythm to pressure (short fragments in Lila's speech). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "lacquered wood glowing like trapped sunlight" sets atmosphere/voice); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opener metaphors doesn't muddle closure; strong verbs/specific nouns propel. Clean mechanics, no filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentinel-mentor trope via burned letter talisman and mismatch philosophy transforms autumn vineyard epiphany; "sun to my moon" callback feels earned, not clichéd. Bold quiet risk in dialogue-driven accumulation heightens subtlety without gimmickry.</comment>
