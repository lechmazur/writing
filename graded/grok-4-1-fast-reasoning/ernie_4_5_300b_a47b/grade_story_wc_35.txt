<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in pavilion risks versus memory-tempering drive, embodied in numbing fingers and guilt surge; final dilution earned via prior tasting causality. Interiority particular to chef's sensory lens avoids stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to pool surge and dilution RR closure; cost legible in "He’d subsumed the founder’s guilt... to dilute it." Orientation anchored early in fortress/rain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavilion's arctic air and shifting tides constrain entry/immersion, charging submersion beat; sensory filter (taste of salt/iron) mirrors chef priorities. Desert rain evolves causally, pressuring wall-licking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (temper remorse) signaled early tightens via deeper submersion and contagious surge, narrowing to dilution trade-off; agency in tasting forecloses entanglement path with felt cost in gasp/vision clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Remorse-as-water motif emerges organically, reweighted in cooking finale ("bitterness softened by... forgiveness") without moralizing; invites ambiguity on carrying versus erasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sensory-biased noticing ("tongue could taste memories"); rhythmic prose modulates from wandering to unsteady legs under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "tidal formations pulsed, their patterns mirroring... guilt"); figurative consistency (water/spice motifs) taught early avoids muddle, though minor density dip in reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory chef in remorse vault transforms memory tropes; risk in contagious premise heightens stakes organically to dilution close.</comment>
