<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like mapping and prying the cap, with embodied age (aching knees) and endurance at tide's rise earning final stasis; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of observations to CR closure ("fairy ring wasn’t a portal—it was a mirror") with legible conceptual cost in aligned past/present and locket's weight easing amid rising tide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and wrecks constrain choices (wading to Luminara's line, prying cap) and charge final image of sitting by ring as tide rises; sensory details (salt-crust, brine air) filtered through folklorist's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering memories signaled early via dream tightens accumulatively through pattern detection and locket find, forcing endurance with physical cost (boots sinking, tide) legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of eternal curiosity bridging past/present emerges organically from particulars like broken constellations and locket vision; final image reconfigures "habits break" into resonant Charged Poise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV with folklorist perceptual signature (constellations in fungi, thresholds); rhythmic modulation under rising pressure, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, interiority without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels to closure, minor overwriting in opening descriptions doesn't touch peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy ring as memory-mirror via broken constellations transforms folklore tropes; risk in quiet CR ending heightens inevitability of eternal curiosity.</comment>
