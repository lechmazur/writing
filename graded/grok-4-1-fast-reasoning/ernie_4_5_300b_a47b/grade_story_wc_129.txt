<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in "luminescent ache" and micro-choices like tracing tags under pressure; Kael's sympathy enables Lira encounter but borders on label-told; earned relational shift at revelation forecloses isolation with shared cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with tag studies to Lira clue to revelation tightening; on-page closure as RR (Charged Poise under arbor) reconfigures loneliness with legible emotional cost in final shared laugh; orientation anchored early in orchard/crater.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass trees' prismatic sap and interlocking branches constrain search tactics via "light bends"; final arbor image charges closure; sensory selection (rainbows, pulsing colors) POV-filtered through sculptor's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (combat loneliness via Veyra search) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to revelation narrowing options; agency in persistent tracing despite dwindling visitors; cost of prior isolation felt in "luminescent ache" reprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kinship theme emerges organically from tags' merging hands to arbor's constellations approving union; final image non-literally answers isolation via shared thread without moralizing; resonant reprise avoids platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of light refraction and threads; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("test" line pursues goal); rhythmic modulation fits lyric fantasy without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., tags "pulsing like a heartbeat"); purposeful figurative pattern taught early pays off at closure; minor overwriting in opening orchard description slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass orchard/tags as kinship webs transforms artist-quest trope; Lira=Veyra twist earned via arbor clue; bold crystalline world logic commits without retreat.</comment>
