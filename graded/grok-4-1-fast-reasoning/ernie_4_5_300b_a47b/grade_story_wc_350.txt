<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's multilingual coaxing and vigorous tenderness reveal particular traits under resistance, earning the final swing; minor label ("empathetically decisive") slightly undercuts shown depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of sounds softening to chorus climax—"The cuckoo burst forth, not in its usual mechanical squawk, but in a chorus of voices"—delivering RR closure with legible metaphorical cost of healed rift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tower acoustics amplify song while candle and starlight constrain repair, charging weight's glow; selective sounds (groans to lullaby) mirror internal shift without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate to bridge silos) tightens accumulatively from inert resistance to glowing arc, forcing endurance with felt cost in "vigorous tenderness"; agency coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared stories/languages emerges organically from repair but Elara's speech—"stories, like grain, must flow freely to nourish"—articulates thesis overtly in final paragraph, diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias to sonic metaphors (groans as language) stable in single POV; purposeful compression in language lists taught early, modulating with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High figurative density ("shadows that danced like restless spirits") patterns as lyric mode without muddle, but language list risks paraphrase loop; strong propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of multilingual repair transforming clock/elevator into symphony of reconciliation feels inevitable; risks bold metaphor without gimmick.</comment>
