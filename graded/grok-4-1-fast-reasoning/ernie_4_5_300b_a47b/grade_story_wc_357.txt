<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-choices like dipping into water sphere and inserting arrow tip reveal embodied curiosity and shift to guardianship, rooted in pilot traits; minimal simultaneous internal contradiction limits higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from warming arrow tip to pedestal insertion triggers light eruption and CR realization of symbiosis over machine, with legible conceptual cost of protection in final flight home.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain glider navigation and cavern entry, while inverting gravity and pulsing vines charge climax; final golden leaves mirror adaptive resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant discovery stake tightens via tip vibration and inversion during insertion, forcing renunciation of exploitation with felt guardianship cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbiosis theme emerges implicitly from pedestal fusion and echoing archives, reweighting premise in "symphony... learned to listen" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with pilot-specific perceptions like "water flow" and "vine-woven glider" sustains rhythmic texture through tension peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Varied syntax propels from "propellers hummed" to eruption thud; purposeful metaphors like "serpents" avoid muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gravity-inverting orchards and arrow-key symbiosis transform eco-discovery premise into inevitable, risk-taking world logic charging protective closure.</comment>
