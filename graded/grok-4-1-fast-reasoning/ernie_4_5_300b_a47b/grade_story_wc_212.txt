<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in generational fury/tranquility compels ritual choices with embodied paradox; internal conflict acts in scattering seeds amid chaos. Final laugh earns change via prior causality. "Furiously tranquil" mindset constrains precision under vortex pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: egg crack accumulates to seeds sprouting then vortex dive, tightening density toward CR closure in sapling image. Orientation anchored early in atrium/egg. Cost legible in "diving into a frozen lake" sensation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atrium's ice constrains roots/melting pivotal to rebirth, charging final image; starlight hues filter through POV to mirror wild serenity. Sensory cold "seeps into the soul" integrates with action. Recurrent frost evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen path) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening from ritual to vortex negotiation narrowing options. Agency in palm press forecloses stability with felt cost. Creature hiss adds pressure without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Paradox of decay/rebirth emerges organically from entropy method, resolved non-literally in "gritty, like sand... smooth, like water" texture discovery. Final sapling reweights inheritance without moralizing. Voices chorus builds resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (entropy shifts, time texture); rhythmic prose modulates to short, punchy vortex lines. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You are the keeper"). Lyrical diction fits fantasy idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload in peak vortex beat ("sea of borrowed moments... threads") muddles slightly (-0.4). No loops; propulsion strong to laughing close. Minor metaphor mix in "green flames."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh entropy paradox transforms relic/egg tropes via seed decay logic; non-obvious "decrease entropy" synthesis inevitable in sapling payoff. Bold textural discovery avoids generic fantasy.</comment>
