<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Heartbroken reaper's motivation intensifies compellingly to climax choice, with Lira's flashed face anchoring internal conflict during prism flare; embodied tremble and whisper reveal contradictory resolve under resistance. Minor backstory tilt stays under BRR, but lacks deeper blind-spot complication in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: page discovery → echo amplification → light refraction narrows to flare DC with CR closure ("echo of sacrifice... giving shape"); orientation anchored early, cost legible in absorbed mist and lingering ache. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dusk light and prism constrain ritual choice, observatory gears/cylinders supply echoes via tactile discovery; final stars charge CR image. Sensory narrowing (thick air, cold prism) mirrors urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears) signaled early, escalates via density increase (whispers to hum to single phrase) under accumulative lens, forcing endurance with embodied cost (tremble); agency in prism adjustment forecloses path, legible price in monsters' return promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of naming/shaping sacrifice emerges organically from ritual failure-risk to CR realization ("shape to the shapeless"), reweighting fears without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer, resonant via particulars like mist absorption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (traces monsters fearfully); rhythmic prose modulates to intensity at flare ("shimmer... solidified"), distinct texture in biased noticing (echoes as wind, Lira's laughter). No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short flare sentences accelerate); minor overwriting in "iridescent scales, silent roars" risks muddle but stays coherent, no loops or scaffolds dulling climax image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper ritualizing sea-monster atlas via light/echoes transforms tropes; non-obvious naming pact feels inevitable from prior particulars, bold CR risk heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
