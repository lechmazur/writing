<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in necessity, shown via trembling fingers and feverish writing during signal chase; micro-choices like tuning dial reveal values under fading pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+; resolute endurance earns closure without deep internal split.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments build density to Charged Poise closure in final image of Lira stepping out with internalized stories, cost felt in persistent signal chase despite fade. Orientation anchored early in alcove/radio setup; single scene causality intact, no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ember alcove, moss glow, and mist selectively constrain and charge actions, culminating in halo merge of radio/moss light that reconfigures sanctuary as internalized voice. Sensory hierarchy (iron taste, crackle, fogged glass) filters through Lira's priorities; vivid, purposeful integration elevates to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of story resurrection signaled early tightens accumulatively via signal shifts and deciphering, narrowing to endurance cost in unnoticed cloak slip and dimming dial. Quiet internal pressure coheres but lacks visceral external reversal, keeping under 8.8 gate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting voices from quiet fragments emerges organically via broadcast phrases and final "dust itself would stir," reweighting premise without statement. Resonant counter-reading in necessity vs. nobility lingers; charged image answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature in musical/misty diction (e.g., "lyrics encoded with fragments"); rhythmic control heightens under dirge shift without slippage. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated images, but minor mist-swirl/moss-glow loops across para create subtle paraphrase drag without obscuring closure. No heavy artifacts in peak scribbling beat; read-aloud ear strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of story famine, ghost bards, and dust voices transforms pirate trope via specific lyric-deciphering; risk in lyric Accumulative frame heightens resonance without gimmick. Final "tuning into frequencies of the forgotten" feels inevitable from fragments.</comment>
