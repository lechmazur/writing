<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to harmonize chaos drives micro-choices like grip adjustment after flat strike, embodied in trembling hands and sweat; internal conflict surfaces in hissed "Not yet," balancing competence with struggle. Final lean against trunk earns stasis with physical cost, revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sound layers densify from flat plank strike to full euphony incorporating screech and apples, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration via silence and mosaic order. Orientation anchored early in floating orchard at blue hour; cost legible in aching arms and heaving chest at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood circle and lightning-scarred trunk constrain strikes, charging final mosaic image; sensory hierarchy favors sound (gong reverberation, cello cry) filtered through Leeward's prophetic bias. Clouds mirror sketches purposefully, evolving with events without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming past shattered circle—tightens via density surge to crescendo, forcing incorporation of rogue elements like screech; agency in dubbing forecloses chaos path with physical cost. Escalation under accumulative lens reweights via pattern break to charged silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of obstacles-as-instruments emerges organically from mallet dubbing and apple thuds, resonant in final mosaic without moralizing; closing hum ghosts composition, reweighting chaos premise non-literally. Complexity lingers in restless-to-still cadence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in musical noticing ("clouds resembling crescendo"); rhythmic prose modulates urgency, syntax echoing fractal waves without head-hopping. Brief mutterings carry distinct, wind-swallowed idiom fitting solitary prophet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "apples thudding to the deck in time"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image of glistening leaves. Minor figurative density in cloud scrolls coherent and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating orchard and fractal-dubbed mallet synthesize fresh prophet's world, transforming chaos trope via specific resonance sketches; risk in sound-only climax heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at mosaic payoff.</comment>
