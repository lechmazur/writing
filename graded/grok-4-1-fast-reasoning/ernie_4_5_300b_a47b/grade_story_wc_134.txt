<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity overriding caution and hesitation before gripping the pearl reveal contradictory impulses under pressure, earning her final acceptance with embodied cost (headache, throat tightening). Pilgrim's archetypal mystery slightly undercuts specificity, but micro-choices align with her motivation to magnify magic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (dissonance to fracture) culminates in on-page CR where cave song returns changed with legible cost (shattered crystals, vanished pearl). Single scene anchors early; pilgrim's flicker-arrival motivates entry without teleport.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cave's pulsing quartz/obsidian and crystal chimes constrain choices (flare at approach, shatter on pearl grip) and charge final image (steady hum beneath melody). Sensory hierarchy (thrum in bones, prismatic skin) mirrors Elara's shift from bright harmony to dark edge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unpredictable cave song) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pearl touch fracturing harmony, narrowing Elara's control with visible cost (chaos swirl, dust settle). Agency in hesitation-to-grip forces trade-off, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of light/dark twins emerges via pearl's chaos revealing balance, reweighted in final image (unpredictable hum beneath melody) without moralizing. Pilgrim's "brightness and darkness are twins" line nearly tips into statement but ties to action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (Elara's bone-hum, blurring vision); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity. Dialogue subtextual ("You didn’t see me coming") pursues goals, distinct from narration's poetic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety (short punchy chaos sentences vs. flowing descriptions) propels; high density integrates sensory/setting into action. Minor overwriting in crystal flares ("flared brighter... hues deepening") avoids loops but risks muddle in peak shatter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pearl-symbols and shadow-overlap synthesize fresh fantasy alchemy, transforming clairvoyant trope via tactile key-to-chaos turn. Risky tone-blend (ethereal to jagged) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
