<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elio's contradictory impulses—musing on exile while sketching, pleading grandmother to stay yet descending—earn the final path choice with embodied cost in trembling hand and synced breath; grandmother applies brief pressure revealing shared curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: glimpse density escalates to CR closure in door-step image reweighting confusion, with legible cost in foreclosed hesitation at junction; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Compass rose and frosted glass constrain choices (spins wildly, warms in palm guiding path); dilation field charges final descent image, sensory hierarchy (humming, vibrating) reflects Elio's stretched perception without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to reframe confusion tightens via glimpse reversal, forcing stance crystallization in path choice under accum lens; agency in descent forecloses overanalysis with felt solitude cost, though grandmother's arrival borders coincidence without full complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of quill-ready step non-literally answers "true north" question by reweighting premise—confusion as freedom—emerging from particulars like smudged ink and quivering needle; ambiguity lingers in adriftness without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (warped stars as faulty bulbs, syrup time) modulates rhythm under stress; grandmother's sparse dialogue carries subtext of inheritance, distinct from Elio's interior.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short shudders amid long musings); no loops, zero artifacts dull closure image of golden light spill; rhythm breathes with hum fading to quiet heart.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation solitude and compass as confusion-guide transforms tropes via stretched perception and post-shutdown freedom; risk in nonlinear glimpse pays off in charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
