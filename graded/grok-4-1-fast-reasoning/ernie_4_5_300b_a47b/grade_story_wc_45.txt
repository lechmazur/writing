<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in skepticism tempered by curiosity, with internal conflict embodied in trembling hand at Elias's reveal; final change earned via tooth-setting choice with relational cost. Minor slip in occasional abstract phrasing like "shrewdly innocent" lacks full contradictory impulses in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: entry with tooth → Elias appearance → dual teeth reveal → setting triggers hum/vision/water flow as CR closure with emotional cost legible in "cleft in certainty closed." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (thorns cutting thumb, hedges shuddering) integrated into action; fountain and teeth as micro-setting constrain choice and charge final flowing water image. Mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel magic/prove skepticism) signaled early, tightens causally via Elias's tooth reveal narrowing options to joint sacrifice; agency in pressing teeth together forecloses doubt path with felt relational cost at "garden’s a mirror."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of garden as mirror/forgiveness emerges organically from particulars like dual teeth bridging memories; final image ("path clear... garden itself had decided to forgive") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (testing thorns for "reality"); dialogue natural/subtextual, distinct (Elias's rough "outsmart the garden" vs. Mara's idiomatic "mistakes are just constellations"). Rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to closure; minor figurative density ("frayed at the edges," "tapestry of memories") in opening fits accumulative texture without muddling peak fountain beat. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh psychological twist on changeling trope via bone-setting/identity mirror; "mistakes are just constellations" line transforms skepticism innovatively, with closure reweighting myth through lived memory without gimmickry.</comment>
