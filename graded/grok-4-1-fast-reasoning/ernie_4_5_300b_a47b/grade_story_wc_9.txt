<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via trembling hands and breath hitching under ritual pressure; contradictory impulses in seeking "penance" while smiling at "willingly perplexed"; final laughter as earned reconfiguration forecloses lingering with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cards/saucer to tree vision; CR closure in healed saucer and new handprint reconfigures "repentance" premise with emotional cost legible in "throat tightened" and acceptance laugh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glade's dissolving edges and shuddering tree constrain climbs/fall, charging final moss landing; lilac wind and ozone anchor POV-biased sensory hierarchy, mirroring internal cracks without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map lost time) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via widening crack to mother's revelation forcing stance shift; agency in tracing/climbing yields visible emotional price in vision's "you kept waiting."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repentance as choice emerges via saucer/tree particulars, reweighted non-literally in final handprint without moralizing; resonance from conflicting images (crack/question to straight line) invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in "ash and honey" tastes and constellation cards; rhythmic modulation peaks in choked laugh, elisions taught early via ritual motifs pay off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "unfastened... pooling like ink" advances action/atmosphere); no loops/artifacts, but minor figurative density in glade description risks slight overwrites pre-vision without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy ritual with family relic transforms atonement tropes; "unfasten" motif risks bold ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via crack/tree payoff without gimmickry.</comment>
