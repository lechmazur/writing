<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied doubt surge ("luminous doubt washed over Lira") conflicting with resolve, compelling micro-choice to demand the fracture despite test; earned change to smile of resolve scales to length without unearned epiphany. Minor abstract therapy-like phrasing in "hierarchy of values" undercuts peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation anchors Lira/ridge/task by para 2; dream shard deepens density via mirrors to shattering pool; RR closure in seed-pool merge and reformed mirrors with conceptual cost of confronting shadows legible in "doubt transformed into resolve."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ridge/seed/cavern details tactile and selective (iridescent seed pulse, glass melting to light pool), constraining choices (kneel/press, reach/trail); recurring seed charges final image absent but resonance felt in thrumming air. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward memory dissonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend memory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via doubt test and dual futures in pool narrowing to courage choice; agency in reaching pool forecloses fear path with felt chest-tightening cost charging end under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-compass emerges via fractured mirrors to pool visions reweighting fear/courage without statement; final ridge thrum/resolution offers non-literal answer, resonant with doubt confrontation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with lyrical perceptual signature (violets bleed to golds, mirrors ripple); dream dialogue purposeful/subtextual advances interpretation; rhythm modulates from whimsical to tense without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion (e.g., "mirrors shattered. Glass rained down, but...melted"); varied rhythm, no loops in peak dream beats; minor overwriting in opening color mosaic but purposeful for tone, clarity intact at pool closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-repair fantasy with paradox test transforms memory trope; empirically whimsical ridge dreams feel organic, risk in surreal pool futures inevitable from particulars.</comment>
