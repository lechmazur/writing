<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's eccentricity vividly embodied in beard of "silver and seaweed" and lifelong study of gaps; final pledge to return memories earned via trunk revelation with felt personal cost of "I've carried enough." Woman's hollow eyes and sob add pressure without overshadowing; minor therapy-speak in "isolation isn't just about being alone" edges below peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain solid: boutonnière prompts approach, woman's lead to hatch, trunk unlocks revelation of scuttling and stolen memories, culminating in Elias's on-page commitment with cost of ending his isolation. Single scene anchors orientation by para 2 ("opal dock," "nautical twilight"); closure as Decisive Change reconfigures stakes legibly. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist "clung like cobwebs" and "parts" to reveal woman, constraining reveal and charging progression to dawn glow; dock's slick planks and rusted hatch tactilely guide spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Elias notes lantern halo fraying); nautical twilight narrows urgency without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode boutonnière as confession) signaled early, tightens via trunk's journal ("trade her pain for mine") forcing Elias's renunciation of borrowed burdens; agency in kneeling to open lock and pledging return shows trade-off. Cost legible in "heart heavy" and foreclosed isolation; one reversal sufficient under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unborrowable redemption emerges via particulars: captain's Edelweiss as "confession, a plea," woman's lost daughter, Elias's "carried enough"; final image reweights isolation as "symbol not of loss, but of hope" without moralizing. Subtext in gaps and residue avoids binaries; child's laughter primes oblique CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited Elias voice distinct in perceptual bias ("eyes the color of storm clouds"); dialogue subtext-rich ("You're here for the memories") pursues goals without exposition. Rhythmic modulation peaks in trunk reveal; no head-hopping, perceptual signature holds under revelation stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in integrated images ("petals brittle as moth wings"); varied rhythm propels from dock to hatch without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("gold halo that frayed at the edges," "rasp like sandpaper") during approach slightly dulls peak propulsion but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Borrowed memories" premise fresh synthesis of guilt-erasure taboo with residue gaps, transformed via Edelweiss confession; risk in quiet CR ending ("child's laughter waited to be reclaimed") heightens isolation stakes organically. No template echoes; hindsight inevitability from gaps observation.</comment>
