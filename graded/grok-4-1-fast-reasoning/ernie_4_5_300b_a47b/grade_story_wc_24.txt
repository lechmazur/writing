<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between routine duty and ritualistic listening act in counting beats; final realization earned via key grip and perceptual shifts without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as counting density builds to CR of seabed clock; cost legible in "longing—ache to hold onto moments" reweighting worldview.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fjord's mirrored calm and station hum constrain ritual, evolving to parting water; key's constellations as micro-setting charge final understanding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ritual counting drives textural deepening of stake to understand clocks; cost unmistakable in blurred horizon, shuddering fjord, and internalized ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>CR ending offers resonant answer via "clocks measure longing," reweighting mechanical premise through key and revelation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in clock-synced noticing (gears whirring, ticking fjord); rhythmic control modulates during countdown without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion in counting beats; no loops, varied rhythm avoids monotony, clear cause/effect in rippling lines to gear-unlocking sound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Seabed hydraulic clock synthesizes station/key into inevitable CR; bold lyric risk in backwards counting heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
