<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's reticence yields to warmly observant anticipation through micro-choices like stacking stones, earning a genuine smile that forecloses dismissal with emotional cost. Contradictory impulses (superstition dismissal vs. curiosity) act in scene at note discovery. Minor tidy epiphany at realization softens peak contradiction slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of notes/stones deepens to CR closure in final image of warm sea glass reconfiguring fragility into connection, with legible conceptual cost ("ache remained, but luminescent"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via repeated rituals suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lantern room as micro-setting constrains stacking at eastern window and charges final glass pocket image. Sensory details (brine taste, wind moan, creaking stairs) selectively mirror internal darkness, integrated into action. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fragile safety post-lamp failure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual deepening that narrows dismissal option, crystallizing endurance agency. Cost felt in persistent "heavy darkness" reweighted luminously at close. One cadence shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of enduring connection emerges organically from chain particulars, answered non-literally by glass "song as quiet hymn" recharging prior ache without moralizing. Subtext in ritual gestures invites ambiguity on sea's indifference. Minor platitude risk in "sea’s children endure" but anchored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in sea-attuned noticing (e.g., rust patterns, wind whispers). Prose texture rhythmic, modulating intensity without filter excess. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; rhythm varies (short creak sentences build ascent). Minor overwriting in "haunted... echoes of sailors" reflections, but no loops or artifacts dull closure image. Clean grammar, no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: message-chain transforms lighthouse trope into ritual endurance, with sea glass "hum" evolving originally. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmick. No derivative templates.</comment>
