<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael's trauma-rooted motivation intensifies through micro-choices like heat-mapping capsize memories, earning endurance of silence with embodied cost in trembling hands; Elias applies relational pressure without dominating. Minor label-speak ("silently expressive") slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ellipses build from solo calibration to shared harmony, landing CR in final conservatory image reweighting silence as presence with capsize gratitude as conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via Elias suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory constrains via vibration transmission to plants, charging breakthrough ("leaves into a gentle, rhythmic dance") and final image; sensory details (breath visible, ice refraction) selectively mirror internal stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Elias's observation forcing exposure and breakthrough deepening knowledge of emotion-mapping; cost legible in endured isolation yielding shared marvel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence's expressiveness emerges organically from vibrations felt over heard, resonant in final image reconfiguring trauma without moralizing; lullaby harmony offers non-literal answer to invisibility fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward vibrations/textures; lyrical diction ("forks gleaming like captured starlight") modulates rhythmically, distinct without dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density in images like "vibrations rippling through the winterglass" propels without loops; varied syntax breathes with scene, minor "silence" recurrence purposeful for theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions to silent tuning-fork music transforms trauma trope ingeniously, culminating in plants-dancing closure inevitable from premise; fresh synthesis heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
