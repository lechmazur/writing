<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's affectionate skepticism drives consistent micro-choices like rejecting the vial and mapping markers, with embodied tingling and contradictory hope in tears at the flare; Mara's pressure forces relational shift. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("somatic markers") slightly abstracts peak interiority without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from initial sketch to week-long mapping, culminating in geode flare's alignment (RR/Charged Poise) reweighting pills' failure with conceptual cost of corporate noise vs. natural precision. Orientation anchored early in studio post-shock; single time-jump shard legible, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Studio's ozone-acrylic-neon specificity integrates tactilely (geode hum, rig shock), with geode as micro-setting constraining mapping choices and charging flare's final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward light patterns; world rules consistent via hologram/news.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (devise natural awareness vs. recall) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through failed maps to flare's deepening, narrowing options with visible cost of tears/laughter and foreclosed pill path. Agency in persistent devising; Mara complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of engineered imprecision vs. organic pathways emerges organically via geode-crystal contrast shifting at flare, offering resonant non-literal answer in "fractally, somatically, undeniably real" without moralizing. Subtext in Mara's vial-touch implies relational buy-in.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (fractal logics, tingling breadcrumbs); dialogue subtextual (Mara's "telepathy?" evades corporate distraction). Rhythmic control modulates from sharp skepticism to hopeful cadence; voices distinct in idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., geode-tracing advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels to flare. Minor patterned artifact in "willowglass hope" repeats (3x) borders template without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geode fractals as somatic compass transforms telepathy trope into awareness quest; risk in sci-fi naturalism (neural maps, static unmasking) heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
