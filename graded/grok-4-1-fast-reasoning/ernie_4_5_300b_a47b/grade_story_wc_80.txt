<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in flickering pragmatism amid "thoughts roared," with micro-choices like gripping inkwell and wresting hatch revealing contradiction. Final note placement earns change with felt vulnerability cost. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("I found you") slightly softens raw ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries densify to groan/hatch/chamber tightening, culminating in CR closure where inkwell lightens and smile reconfigures absence premise with conceptual endurance cost. Orientation anchored early in shallows/drawbridge. Lens taught and paid off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains via silt-sinking boots, hidden hatch, and isolating drawbridge, charging final exhale image. Sensory hierarchy (tactile silt, visual amber) reflects surveyor's bias. Algae-veined mosaic mirrors internal voids purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearthing dreams) signaled early, tightens via groan reversal narrowing to personal legacy discovery under accumulative lens. Agency in hatch-wrest and note-placement forecloses isolation with emotional exposure cost. Internal pressure dominates without external antagonist, fitting length but capping peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interlaced absence emerges organically from note-smear, chamber carvings, to final "dreams...waiting" repricing, reweighting ruins without moralizing. Subtext in deliberate ink flaw invites ambiguity on presence/absence. Thematic cost legible in lighter inkwell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: surveyor's precise mapping yields to sensitive "ghostly architecture" lens. Rhythm modulates from hushed description to racing heart compression. Prose texture distinct, diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hushed blaze...gilded edges" advances atmosphere/action); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density ("liquid amber," "exhale") in reflective beats borders overwrite but supports tone without muddling closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor-as-dream-archeologist transforms ruin trope via grandmother chamber link and inkwell thread. Risky quiet CR heightens conceptual stakes organically. No template echoes; pavilion's breath/groan inflects uniquely.</comment>
