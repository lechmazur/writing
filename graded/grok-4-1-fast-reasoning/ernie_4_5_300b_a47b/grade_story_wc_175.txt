<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied details like trembling hands and aching fingers revealing reverence under meticulous pressure; motivation rooted in honoring fragility compels the weaving; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup to monarch's charged poise closure; ephemeral lattice signals felt cost ("dissolve by morning") in final image; orientation anchors instantly in grotto with Lirael and wing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moss sinks knees and fading light pressures timing of weave, constraining action; sensory selectivity (dew taste, spongy moss) mirrors urgency; grotto micro-setting charges final hovering moment without tourist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to honor moth via lattice signaled early, tightens accumulatively to monarch landing reversal narrowing transience options; agency in persistent weaving shows endurance cost (aching fingers, held breath); stakes viscerally felt but softly internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transient reverence emerges organically from weave and fleeting visit, reweighting overlooked deaths without statement; final lattice/monarch touch offers non-literal resonant answer to honoring fragility; ambiguity lingers in dissolving signal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward natural veins/pulses and silk rhythms, stable third-limited distance; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with interrupted breaths mirroring weave, high density in sensory propulsion; overwriting in metaphors ("wings slicing like a hymn," "spun sugar") crowds high-density beats without pattern payoff, dulling peak slightly; minor stillness/lattice loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of esoteric weaving for insect memorials transforms quiet ecology trope via silk lattice and last monarch; risk in verdant-clouds surrealism heightens transient stakes organically; no close famous echoes.</comment>
