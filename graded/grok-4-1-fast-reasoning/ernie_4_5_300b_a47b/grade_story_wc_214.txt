<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zara's interiority embodied in calloused hands and lantern use reveals contradictory duty-spirit impulses under Veyra's chiding; final endurance of unscientific path earned with relational cost as Veyra softens. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "find strength in vulnerability" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of star fragments and walk builds to CR closure in "a single speck of stardust glimmered," reweighting science-spirit divide with Veyra's cracked facade as undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via fractured star suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plateau's obsidian shards and crater constrain Zara's walk, charging final lantern-stardust image; sensory selectivity (velvet sky, pulsing glow) mirrors internal hush without catalog. POV bias filters station as "patient as stone."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empathize to map heart) signaled early, textural escalation via star fracture and descent narrows to endurance choice at crater; agency in kneeling/placing lantern forecloses tidy science with felt vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stillness in motion emerges implicitly via star's "release as liberation," resonant non-literal answer in speck's glimmer recharging lantern motif without moralizing; complexity in Veyra's flicker avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in cosmic whispers and blurred time; diction/rhythm modulate from hush to primal steps, distinct from Veyra's rasping dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with sentence length in walk ("hours passed, or perhaps minutes"); high density integrates image/action, but minor overwriting in "tears from the heavens" risks muddle without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor premise freshened via star-empathy synthesis, transforming trope through lantern-stardust payoff; risk in lyric hush vs. Veyra's arc heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
