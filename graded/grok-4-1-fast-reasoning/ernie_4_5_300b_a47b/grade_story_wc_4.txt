<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied actions like drawing vine arcs and tucking the feather, revealing character-particular worldview on decay-as-art; motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy intensifies via sketches. Minor slip in epiphanic realization ("all of it could be reshaped") bordering on unearned without sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building density of arcs/vines/images to CR closure ("The factory wasn’t dying... evolving, just as she was") with felt cost of accepting incomplete healing; anchors who/where/when by para 2. One tightening via dove interrupting sketch, priming final reconfiguration; next-morning shard legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (lavender scent on breeze, cool metal clasp) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism; recurring vines/factory constrain perception and charge final image ("vines had climbed higher overnight... urging her on"). POV bias filters details purposefully (arcs prioritized).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute grief via art/nature) signaled early, accumulates via sketch/dove/return; tightening in realization forecloses erasure-path with endurance cost. Pressure internal/coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks visceral external test, keeping stakes more felt than viscerally narrowed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilient transmutation emerges organically from vine arcs reclaiming factory, culminating in resonant CR final image ("dove in flight... *enough*") reweighting grief without moralizing. Subtext in dove feather as messenger invites ambiguity; earned via particulars, not platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (arc-curves fixation, meditative rhythm); syntax modulates from lingering description to crisp resolve ("she began to shoot"). Lyrical compression taught early (opening field/factory), legible at charged ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying para lengths; strong verbs/nouns propel meditative pace. Minor paraphrase loop in vine-climbing mentions (−0.3), but no closure harm; no filter stacks or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of factory decay/lavender reclamation via "arcs" motif transforms healing trope through archivist's gaze. Earnest whimsy in dove messenger risks whimsy overload but grounds in tactile specifics; no close famous echoes.</comment>
