<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to rediscover joy roots consistently in her art and intensifies via fragment discovery, compelling the display; embodied reactions like "fingers itch" and "breath catch" reveal character under pressure, with earned shift to "resurrection" via Marla's recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from finding to display climax; closure as Charged Poise in "She’d fight back with light" reconfigures fog's dominance with felt emotional cost in "chest tight" and trembling hands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog recurs to constrain light-painting and mirror Lira's blurred memories, charging final image where it "thins" against joy; sensory details like "moss-choked paths" and "damp walls" integrate purposefully through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of joy vs. fog's silence signaled early, tightens accumulatively at Marla's recognition and crowd growth; agency in display forces emotional trade-off, with cost legible in shift from "requiem" to resurrection stirring "old joy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting joy through preserved fragments emerges organically from events and exposed film metaphor; final "Everything" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting decay into hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias to light/prisms stable in single POV; diction like "stolen sunbeam" and rhythmic modulation heighten accumulative texture without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in light-painting beats; minor overwrite in stacked similes ("fireflies," "amplified by fog") purposeful but risks muddle, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-art in foggy ruins transforms rediscovery trope; fragment's laughter echoing via display feels inevitable, with risk in joyful resurrection amid decay heightening stakes.</comment>
