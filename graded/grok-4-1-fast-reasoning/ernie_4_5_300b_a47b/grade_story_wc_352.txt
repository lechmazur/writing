<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in archival expertise drives intuitive choices like the left fork; embodied sensations (trembling fingers, lurching stomach) ground interiority; transformation to "keeper of thresholds" earned by journey's costs without contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: doodle patterns and glow density build to map reconfiguration post-inversion; Charged Poise closure via key-pocket image crystallizes role with time-cost legibility in "stumbled, catching herself"; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens under urgency (fogged breath, scraping boots); grotto forks and low ceiling constrain path choices; gravity inversion as micro-setting charges movement and final stumble, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find seeds pre-inversion) signaled via watch; agency in tracing doodle triggers flip-deepening to map/alcove; cost visible in narrowed time/options, reweighting via box discovery under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden margins/vigilance emerges via doodle evolution to map/key without statement; final "world full of doors" image resonantly reconfigures premise organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature (kaleidoscope mind, whispered secrets) biases noticing; stable third-limited POV with clean distance; rhythmic syntax modulates inversion peak effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "boots sinking into damp earth" advances setting/action); varied rhythm propels; minor figurative density in opening but purposeful, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Gravity inversion transforms quest trope via symbol accumulation; fresh synthesis of archival mysticism and physics defiance feels inevitable in key's promise, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
