<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to prove rational enchantment drives weaving choices consistently, with embodied reactions like quickened breath under pressure; internal conflict emerges in sanity risk during eruption. Curator applies light relational pressure via cryptic guidance. Minor weakness: epiphanies like "perfect balance of rational enchantment" verge on unearned diagnostic phrasing in post-eruption beat, but do not undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via weaving lattice to eruption pattern-break, reconfiguring space; two-shard structure (gallery to infinite web back via door) transitions legibly. Closure as CR lands on-page with conceptual cost of permanently altered perception in final street-shift image. Orientation anchored early in gallery description; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (warping glass, shifting floor, glowing thread) filter through Clara's architect bias, constraining weaving amid mirrors. Gallery micro-setting charges eruption and door-weaving climax; recurring thread as object mirrors internal shift, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover connection's texture) signaled early, tightens via eruption reversal narrowing options to re-weave in infinite space; agency in door-weaving forecloses prior doubt with felt sanity cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise at revelation; curator's echo complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection as woven patterns emerges organically from thread/mirror interplay, reweighted in CR ending without moralizing; curator's "Memories alter... realistically so" line subtly tensions concept. Final pocket-thread image resonates non-literally, inviting ambiguity on reality's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (lattice of light/shadow); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in eruption ("thousand shimmering strands"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing curator's hum from Clara's resolve; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sinew thread stretched, taut and humming" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in eruption burst. Minor overwriting in fractal/prism metaphors clusters pre-climax without muddling; purposeful "weave" repetition pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architect weaving sinew-reality in illusion gallery transforms logic-vs-magic trope via textural eruptions/doors; surreal shifts feel inevitable from early thread cue. Risky non-causal surrealism heightens stakes coherently, with thread-pocket reprise charging CR without gimmick.</comment>
