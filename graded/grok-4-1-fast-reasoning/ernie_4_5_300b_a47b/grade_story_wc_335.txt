<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied nervous habit and tea-reading ritual; woman's arrival forces micro-choice revealing mentorship drive. Contradictory impulses (avoidance vs. engagement) act in scene, earning final resolve. Minor genericism in visitor flattens relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visitor's arrival and tea annotation build density to Charged Poise closure where woman's nod reconfigures exile stake with felt sacrifice cost. Orientation anchored early (library, Lirael by para 2). Subtle causality in advice linkage earns quiet tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurrent shadow-in-glass constrains perception and charges final image ("shadow stretching, thinning"), mirroring internal reversal. Sensory hierarchy (creak, damp parchment, tea leaves) filters via Lirael's archivist bias, evolving with light shift. Micro-setting (tea cup) enables pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (village exile reversal) signaled via visitor, tightens accumulatively through tea convergence narrowing to "walk backwards" renunciation with on-page cost (confrontation). Agency in Lirael's guidance and woman's resolve drives escalation under lens. No reversal overload; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges organically from tea patterns, backwards walking, and shadow shift, offering resonant non-literal answer in final smile/light path. Subtext in combative tenderness invites ambiguity without moralizing. Particulars (leaves as constellations) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fractured light/shadow observations biases POV stably; rhythmic modulation heightens quiet pressure. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Exile is reversible"), distinguishing voices without convergence. Clean third-limited with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sliver of light slicing...jagged pattern" advances setting/action/theme); rhythm varies for ear. Minor overwrought metaphors ("constellations only she could see") purposeful, not muddling closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea geometry divination and backwards-walking metaphor transforms exile trope into inevitable closure image. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes via light/shadow without gimmickry. Non-obvious archivist frame feels organic/memorable.</comment>
