<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to touch time's texture drives consistent micro-choices, embodied in fragment handling and vision overload; interior conflict surfaces in surging retrocognition vs. clarity gained. Final renunciation earned by causal buildup, with cost in lost visions and inert fragment. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("time wasn’t a texture to be touched, but a story") avoids peak diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via visions, garden shifts, disintegration to CR closure where garden reforms and premise reweights (time as story) with conceptual cost (goal thwarted, visions silenced). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via fragment press suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (pulsing vines, ozone scent, pixelating wood) filters through Elara's geometric bias, constraining choices (paths reveal, bridge arches). Final reform charges image, mirroring internal shift; hyperbolic paths evolve causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vision density and disintegration, narrowing to renunciation with legible cost (fall, biting fragment, silenced visions). Agency in catalyst press forces trade-off; no abstract stakes, pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (time's marks as story) emerges organically from fragment resonance, vision threads, garden fray; final image reconfigures ("design one to remember") without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in lost powers. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (time folds, geometry looms); diction/rhythm modulates from lush to fractured in peak visions, then clear. No head-hopping or filter excess; perceptual bias sharpens under stress.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring frenzy (short shards in visions); no loops, scaffolds, or metaphor muddle in climax (pixelate to fireflies purposeful). Minor density in opening lushness doesn't touch closure; read-aloud rhythm strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living geometry, retrocognition, halo catalyst transforms time-trope into tactile unraveling; risk in hyperbolic collapse pays off in reformed clarity. No derivative templates; bold conceptual pivot feels inevitable.</comment>
