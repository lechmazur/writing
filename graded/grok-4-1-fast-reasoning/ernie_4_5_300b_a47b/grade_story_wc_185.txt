<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mapkeeper's motivation to restore harmony roots in embodied strain (ribs aching, teeth aching), compelling micro-choices like tracing cracks and pressing the stone. Interiority concrete and particular (fingers dancing like Braille). Earned endurance under pressure shows in focus amid escalating noise, with final relief as visible cost paid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from frost ridges to bloom's sigh, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where caves' hush reweights noise as "wind through leaves." Orientation anchored immediately in caves/mapkeeper. Closure cost legible in "ribs no longer aching" and translucent beings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harmonic caves vividly constrain via cracks/spiral guiding stone placement and bloom rooting. Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant, narrowing under crisis (hum clawing mind). Ice fissures as micro-setting evolve causally, mirroring internal shift and charging final imprint trace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet storm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intensifying hum/teeth ache forcing deeper focus. Agency in conjuring narrows to endurance trade-off. Cost unmistakable in physical toll during bloom manifestation, reweighting options to harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sound/silence balance emerges organically from spiral-to-bloom arc, final image ("quiet within it") resonating non-literally as duet of hush/hum. Subtext in fraying static invites ambiguity without morals. Protagonist arc inextricable from finding equilibrium.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature ("sound bent like light"). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compressing under stress (short pulses in climax). Consistent diction/texture reflects mapkeeper's attuned mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate sensory propulsion (cracks "vibrate, edges blurring"). Metaphors coherent (ice melting to sound), varying rhythm without loops. Minor glow repetition purposeful for accumulative texture, no scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fantasy (ripple-mapkeeper, hush bloom) transforms tropes via ice-as-memory fissures. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in silence-seeking ritual. Inevitable hindsight: quiet-in-storm reconfigures premise organically.</comment>
