<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's meticulous traits and thawing mistrust drive micro-choices like fetching the lens and saying "Show me," earning his role change; contradictory hesitation ("throat tightened") embodies internal conflict without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ticket doodles accumulate revelations to CR closure where Elias doodles instead of logging, reweighting silence as language with conceptual cost to his routine; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Slick stones, humming crystals post-rain constrain actions (tracing surfaces, vibrations in chest) and charge final image of gleaming forecourt as promise; sensory details (breath visible, faint glow) filtered through Elias's priorities integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding silence tightens via lens/map revelations narrowing to trust Lira, forcing agency in "Show me"; cost legible in foreclosed verbal logging for doodling under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as honest language emerges via doodles/lens/crystals without statement, resonating in final doodle reweighting words as overrated; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable Elias POV with perceptual bias (noticing stubs' weight, doodles); dialogue subtextual ("You're late," "honesty is the only currency") advances goals; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops, varying rhythm accelerates revelations; purposeful repetition of "hush" builds texture without artifacts, propelling to charged final doodle image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tickets as decoder keys via lens transforms silence trope; risk of non-verbal premise pays off in ingenious CR closure, feeling inevitable from doodles/crystals.</comment>
