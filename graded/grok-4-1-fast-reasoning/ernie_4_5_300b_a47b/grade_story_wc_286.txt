<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong zen interiority and motivation via "breath steadied" micro-choices, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses beyond vision glimpse of "younger, fiercer" self; arc earned yet smooth without raw flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density to CR closure in "Mara understood... choosing which timeline to nurture," cost legible in personal past tie and forward carry of "warm and pulsing" lantern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunflowers recur to constrain sun-pattern discovery and charge closure beacon image; vivid ash-taste, skeletal hives integrate purposefully without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant understanding stake signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lantern-vision link to her past role; agency in placing glass forces deepening with felt memory cost, no reversal overload needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kindness-anchoring theme emerges organically from sunflower/lantern particulars to resonant non-literal CR in final clay-spinning image with glowing promise; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with zen-perceptual signature ("mind like still water"); rhythmic modulation peaks in vision thrumming, clean without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels, varied rhythm passes ear test, but figurative density in vision ("air split... jagged shadows danced like ghosts") risks overwriting without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious phototropic-kindness/timeline/beekeeping synthesis feels inevitable; transforms wasteland tropes via specific oasis memory without derivative hedging.</comment>
