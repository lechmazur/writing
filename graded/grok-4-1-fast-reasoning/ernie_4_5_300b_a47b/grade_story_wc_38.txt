<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's admiration for the scientist's paradox drives mirroring her dance, earning the defiant waltz against drones; embodied pulse quickens and throat tightens reveal contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as dance patterns accumulate to vial reveal and drone defeat; closure CR via final image of vial secure and realization reconfigures vulnerability with felt resolve cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Diving suit fog and dripping cracks constrain movement; shattered tank hides projector that shifts walls via dance, charging spatial pressure into final harbor emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to liberate antidote tightens accumulatively from hologram to drones; agency in defiant waltz forecloses drone threat with sensor chaos cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-strength emerges via dance codes and journal; final "spider had spun its web... without fear" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of lived puzzles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature—"threading silence through drowned corridors"—modulates rhythm under drone stress without slippage; elision of scientist's full past taught early, paid in mimicry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies from patient descent to fast spin against drones; purposeful metaphors like "limbs trace patterns" cohere without muddle in climax, high density propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dance as cipher defeating tech synthesizes code-breaking and vulnerability organically; risk of lyric mode heightens stakes via rhythmic chaos without gimmickry.</comment>
