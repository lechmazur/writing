<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in Lira's childhood sobs echoing firmware's guilt, compelling the tether decision; interior conflict embodied in trembling hands before entry. Minor slip in quick epiphany at "her own childhood echoed," bordering stock phrasing without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with amber pulse → explanation → entry → nursery reading as DC closure; on-page cost legible in cries softening to hum, amber fading. Two clean shards with legible transition; orientation anchored early in lab.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (ozone/regret, amber thrum) filters through Lira's tattooist lens; amber as micro-setting constrains climax palm-press and charges final fade. Spatial choreography coherent across lab-to-corridor shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush dissonance) signaled early, tightens causally via labyrinth entry narrowing to personal confrontation; nursery cries force renunciation of escape with embodied cost in voiced letter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness over silencing emerges organically via letters repricing scientists' guilt; final hum reweights cries motif without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer to dissonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (stars on skin, star maps etched); dialogue subtextual in Elara's taps/explanations advances stakes. Prose texture modulates rhythmically from lab hum to nursery wail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor overwrite in "fractal patterns on the walls" amid pressure, but no loops touching closure. Clean syntax supports causal beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooist, amber key, firmware translating cries transforms sci-fi tropes via personal guilt; risk in digital-past fold pays off at earned closure without gimmickry.</comment>
