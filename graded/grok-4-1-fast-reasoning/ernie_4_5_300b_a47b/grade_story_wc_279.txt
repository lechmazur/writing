<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied (lilac unease tightening chest), with contradictory impulses in hesitation to interject despite the tile's urgency. Micro-choices like drawing the mandala and pressing the tile reveal values under pressure, earning her shift to determination. Minor slip: epiphany at "It’s a language" borders tidy without deeper embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from tile discovery to mandala alignment and holographic projection, culminating in on-page CR ("It’s a language") reweighting unlearning with conceptual cost in the breathing silence. Orientation anchored early (grotto, Mara kneeling by ~100 words). Lens holds cleanly to closure; persistent pattern constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's acoustics and mossy sand constrain choices (whispers tuned by mandala, tile fits depression), charging final holographic image on ceiling. Sensory details selective via POV (lilac glow, resonant hum). Micro-setting (chalk, pouch) integrates tactilely, mirroring internal shift from unease to resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode hush without disrupting it) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when tile urges "Interject" and mandala reveals map, narrowing options with risk to fragile silence. Agency in pressing tile forecloses passive documentation. Cost felt in shuddering grotto and crystallized determination charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning as collaborative truth-making emerges organically from hush-to-language shift, without statements. Final drawing and bell toll offer resonant non-literal answer, reweighting "mess" via particulars. Subtext in patterns avoids moralizing; ambiguity in hush's fragility lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (chalk artist's galaxy patterns, lilac hues). Prose texture modulates rhythmically with intensity (short urgent strokes in drawing beats). Minor poetic elevation fits whimsical voice but risks register drift in "emergent hush" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., tile flake "pulsed... absorbed secrets" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language purposeful (sand "swirling like tiny dancers") without muddle in peak mandala beat. No loops; minor repetition of "whispers" pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk art decoding acoustic mysticism transforms discovery trope via mandala-as-map. Risky Accumulative CR feels inevitable from patterns; no close echoes. Bold voice commits to premise without hedging.</comment>
