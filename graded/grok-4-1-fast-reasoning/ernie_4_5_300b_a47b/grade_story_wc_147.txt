<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene ("instinct was to smash it... overriding the urge"), earning the final release with embodied cost (sound pierces soul); interiority concrete and particular. Minor abstraction in motivation ("harness the ephemeral") shown through actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of scent/memories builds to CR closure ("hush shattered... lesson remained") with conceptual cost legible in final image ("secrets... stay buried"). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Temple's hush and fissure constrain choices (squeeze through, demand patience); vial/scent as micro-setting charges final image (empty but radiant). Sensory hierarchy sharpens under crisis (bioluminescence, lavender/saltwater).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (decode before storm) tightens texturally via vial's revelation/voices; agency in overriding instinct forecloses trapping path with felt cost ("sound pierced... soul"). Entry to 8.8+ met but minor abstractness in storm pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image resonant non-literal answer to "harness ephemeral" (release over trap, hush gone but lesson lingers); emerges organically from particulars without moralizing. 9+ test met, reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (diver's bias: algae-slick stone, suit vents); rhythmic control heightens immersion (short sentences in crisis). No elision issues; voice modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "whispers coiled like eels") in peak beats. Zero scaffold; read-aloud propulsion flawless to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-memory vault in hush-temple transforms lost-city trope; risk in lyric underwater solo heightens stakes (+0.3). Inevitable in hindsight via vial's evolution.</comment>
