<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's skepticism creates contradiction with thrill-seeking, embodied in fraying resolve at the hologram reveal; final renunciation of carrying the truth feels earned via prior valve turns. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "throat tightened" at peak without deeper embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through valve-turn linkages opening shaft and panel; CR closure lands on-page with legible cost in "valve wheel felt heavier now" and abandonment. Orientation anchored early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel and chamber constrain descent and valve use, charging final image of dawn through ivy; recurring valve as micro-setting evolves tactilely from trophy to icy sentinel. Sensory selection (fogged breath, dust rain) mirrors urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swallowed truth) tightens via agency-driven valve turns forcing descent and revelation under causal lens; cost unmistakable in human failure realization foreclosing supernatural pursuit. Hologram complicates without resolving coincidentally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of greed-amplified failure emerges organically from hologram chaos glimpses, resonating in final valve abandonment without moralizing; reweights skepticism premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with skeptical perceptual bias (e.g., "science met superstition"); dialogue sparse but subtextual in "You're late" / "Late for what?" exchange advances reveal naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm in peak shudder; minor scaffold in repeated "fit perfectly" / "fit a missing port" near climax dings slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh machine-hunger ghost twist via valve as cover-up key transforms urban exploration trope; hologram stutter integrates organically without late rules.</comment>
