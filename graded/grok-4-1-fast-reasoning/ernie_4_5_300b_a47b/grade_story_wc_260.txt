<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like trembling hands positioning the scale, earn the final reconstruction; minor diagnostic slips like "fragile convictions" slightly abstract the conflict without flattening it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through reconstruction to CR closure—the dawn tail rippling hues reweights survival with cost; orientation anchors early in workshop/terrarium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty workshop and terrarium tools constrain the solitary reconstruction and charge the final lifted-mist image; sensory details like "iridescent scales catching starlight" filter through Lira's care bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebuilding purpose escalates accumulatively via shedding layers during reconstruction, narrowing to Charged Poise with felt cost in "shed the layers that had made her vulnerable"; agency in meticulous scaling forecloses naivety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of compassion as resilience emerges organically from tail reconstruction, resonating in final rippling hues; slight overtness in ending "compassion wasn’t a liability" borders thematic echo, muting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature—mist as "ghost’s breath," scales as "map of survival"—modulates intensity consistently; stable close-third POV biases toward gentle priorities without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion integrate metaphors like "hinges creaking like a hinge in time" without muddle; minor opening density risks overwrite but supports shimmering texture to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chameleon shedding as human resilience transforms redemption trope; tail's spiral scales enable non-obvious CR without gimmickry.</comment>
