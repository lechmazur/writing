<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied reactions like Elias's "breath caught" and "chill ran down his spine" reveal character under pressure; final micro-choice to speak words earns change with felt cost. Patient traits drive consistent motivation without stock phrasing. Minor weakness: woman's traits lean label-like until action ties them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: note → meeting → revelation → dome ritual → DC closure as library answers with shudder and voice, cost legible in "teeth ache" and dust. Orientation anchored early in rooftop details. Single scene with smooth interior transition; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors like "wisteria vines" and "string lights" filter through Elias's perception; dome's "hum" and "vibration" constrain ritual and charge final shudder image. Meteor shower mirrors stakes as "fleeting" truth, evolving causally. Spatial choreography clear from garden to dome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken building language) signals early, tightens via revelations narrowing to ritual agency; speaking words forecloses doubt with visceral cost in shudder. Causal escalation under lens; no abstract stakes, all dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of lies/truth emerges organically from "agreed upon" fictions to final "lie to the building," reweighted by voice answer without moralizing. Subtext in silences and meteor image offers resonant non-literal close. Complexity in sleeping language avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (buildings as tongues); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., "borrowed sugar" reveal advances plot. Voice texture distinct in syntax like "dialects of stone and timber." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, e.g., short punchy final sentences propel closure. Minor overwriting in "engravings shifting like liquid" but no loops or artifacts dulling peak; strong verbs dominate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dead building languages and guardian architect transforms tropes; seal ritual feels inevitable from established motifs. Risky non-human reveal heightens stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
