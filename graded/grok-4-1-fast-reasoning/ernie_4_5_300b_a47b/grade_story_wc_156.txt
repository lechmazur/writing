<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol's interiority is embodied (pulse quickens, throat tightens) and traits like methodically playful drive micro-choices in experiments; Dr. Lysander applies relevant pressure. Final realization of inheritance feels earned via causal buildup. Minor epiphanic polish at "garden wasn’t just a place—it was a state of mind" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from alignments to mural dance, woman's wink, lullaby—reweighting stake to personal memory. Closure as CR: nickel/lullaby reconfigures premise with emotional cost ("throat tightened"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening (harmonization) suffices; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's hum, nodes, dish constrain choices (angle adjustment scatters harmonics); nickel/mural as micro-settings charge final image (lullaby recognition). Sensory hierarchy (frequencies over visuals) reflects priorities. Final mural detail (etched nickel) recharges earlier motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken secrets) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shimmering cracks to nested reveals, narrowing to personal memory with felt cost (grandfather's lullaby evokes loss). Agency in positioning/whispering; no coincidence resolution. Minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of nested awakenings/curiosity vs. certainty emerges via particulars (mural layers, nickel prism); final image (hum lingering, "dancing to it") offers non-literal resonance. Dr. Lysander's "Certainty is a cage" borders echo but integrates via dialogue. Complexity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (colors as memories, sound as awakening); diction/rhythm modulate (short sentences in reveals). Dialogue distinct (Dr.'s formulaic vs. Marisol's questions), subtext-laden. No head-hopping; voice textured without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "The garden seemed to hold its breath. Then..."); no loops/artifacts dull closure. Figurative language purposeful (sound as key/prism). Minor repetition of "awakened" patterned, not churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hobo nickel as sound prism in wave garden transforms awakening trope via acoustics/memory. Risky conceptual frame (nested frequencies) inevitable in hindsight, heightens closure without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
