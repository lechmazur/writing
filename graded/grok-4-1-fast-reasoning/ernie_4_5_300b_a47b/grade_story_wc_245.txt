<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation through ring vibrations and sensory obedience, with grief driving steady pursuit; interiority particular to blindness via tactile translations. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses acting in scene, e.g., no on-page hesitation before digging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory densities build to Conceptual Repricing at stillpoint reunion; orientation anchored early in Whispering Glade. Closure cost legible in "map trembled... guiding him deeper," reweighting emotional navigation with journey's immersion paid on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest vividly constrains choices via hums, moss, and Silver Vein, charging final image; sensory hierarchy blind-specific (vibrations over sight). Recurring bioluminescent moss and upside-down river mirror internal depths without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach stillpoint) signaled early, tightens texturally through ring intensifications and "Dig" command narrowing options. Escalation driven by agency in wading/digging; cost felt in electric water and silt plunge, though single deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of "feeling becomes seeing" emerges organically from particulars like emotional map converging lines. Final image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing: mother's vibration echoes ring's translations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in vibrational diction; voice modulates poetically under pressure. Mother's brief dialogue natural, subtextual in vibration delivery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; metaphors purposeful (e.g., "time pooled like mercury") without muddle in peak dig/reunion. Minor scaffold in adjacent "hum" repetitions, but propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind sensory fantasy and emotional cartography; ring's language absorption transforms tropes organically. Risky quiet blaze tone heightens stakes in stillpoint CR without gimmick.</comment>
