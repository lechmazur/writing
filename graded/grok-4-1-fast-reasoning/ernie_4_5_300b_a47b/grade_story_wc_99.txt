<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Yorick's motivation rooted in patient wisdom compels lace-stitching choice with embodied calm under Lira's urgency; internal conflict in "fractured" rhythm acts simultaneously with action. Lira's blame layers contradictorily into raw apology at closure. Ghost brief but pressures forgiveness; voice distinction crisp in Yorick's deliberate speech vs. Lira's frayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: compass spin to lace-weaving density break narrows to sea voyage, culminating in RR closure via ghost solidification and calm sea with emotional cost legible in mutual apologies. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (islet, studio, Yorick). One tightening sufficient; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breezy islet's damp tang and wet kelp constrain voyage timing (dawn row); lace and bonsai as micro-settings charge final image, mirroring nurtured roots/wounds. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (Yorick notices thread glow, etchings). Barnacle-encrusted wreck evolves causally with parting water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock memories via unsaid words) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through vibrating compass/sea churn forcing stance crystallization in apologies. Agency in Yorick's weaving/rowing; cost felt in "raw" words and foreclosed blame. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tides/remembrance emerges organically via lace as emotional map, reweighting silence into peace without statement; final bonsai return offers non-literal answer to severance door. Subtext in chain-link forgiveness stitch lingers with ambiguity (ghost solidifies but fades). No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (rhythmic noticing: drip of snow, retreating waves); dialogue subtextual ("Diffuse the tides" implies method) and goal-driven. Rhythmic prose modulates with pressure; no head-hopping, distinct idiolects (Yorick's murmur vs. Lira's hitch).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., stitching advances plot/character/theme); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak stitching beat purposeful under accumulative lens, charging glow on face. Clean mechanics, propulsion matches scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lace-as-language transforms ghost reunion trope via bonsai/tides synthesis; fresh "color of unspoken apologies" inflection inevitable from etched compass setup. Risky cerulean texture heightens stakes without obscurity; no derivatives.</comment>
