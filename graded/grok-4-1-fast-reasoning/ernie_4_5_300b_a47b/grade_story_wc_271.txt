<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied PTSD via trembling hands and flinching to rubble creates contradictory impulses acting in scene; final non-freeze at photo earned by somatic anchors. Minor therapy-speak in Voss's explanation ("somatic markers") feels diagnostic without full embodiment, but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from kneeling/pressing stone to charged poise closure where Lila tucks photo steadily, reconfiguring grief with felt cost (holds absence without crumbling). Orientation anchored early (arboretum cliff, routine); single scene coherent, one deepening via flinch/recovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stone bench constrains anchoring choice and grounds flashback recovery; ocean roar, salt, lavender charge final image of steady heart. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (gravel crunch, gull cries mirror priorities); vivid, integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor stillness) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via flinch (narrows options to somatic recovery) forcing endurance; cost legible in held grief shape. Agency in breathing/micro-choices coheres pressure to closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of realism-anchored optimism emerges via particulars (lavender sprig, Voss's ships journal, photo smoothing); final image resonates non-literally as lens on brokenness. Minor thematic echo in Lila's voiced "anchor optimism in realism" borders statement but ties to prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (rough stone, soft petals bias); dialogue natural/subtextual (Voss's hand on knee pursues encouragement). Rhythmic control modulates intensity; distinct voices (Lila hesitant, Voss grounded).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs in peak flinch beat. Strategic telling efficient (Voss backstory); concrete over generic throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of somatic therapy in cliffside botany transforms grief trope; risk in quiet charged poise pays off via photo/photo non-freeze arc. Organic, non-template via drone survivor particularity.</comment>
