<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lumin's sentimentalism drives concrete micro-choices like adjusting the gear and following sonar, with embodied ache for fire contrasting elder wisdom; internal conflict layers in dreams and trembling hands. Ghost applies relational pressure, forcing reinterpretation. Final renunciation of scars feels earned, though epiphany borders tidy in "generational patterns weren’t chains—they were bridges."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonar pings accumulate density toward ghost revelation and gear placement as CR, reweighting fire as "a quieter kind" with conceptual cost of refining choices. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph's nebula garden and gear. No lens ambiguity; closure image of spinning gear charges premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden vividly selective—petals as "forgotten constellations," sonar vibrating bones—constrains choices via pinging guidance and merges with gear in crystalline tree for final image. Sensory hierarchy fits Lumin's attunement; evolves causally as petals fall faster in approval. Micro-setting (gear, trees) charges closure without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode fire's abandonment for healing light) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via intensified pinging and ghost's "light is fire," narrowing to renunciation; agency in placing gear forecloses hoarding with felt cost of leaving relic. One tightening sufficient; moral calculus between violence and whisper sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns as bridges emerges from particulars—gear's spiral, ghost's warmth, petals' applause—reweighting fire/light duality without statement; final "gentler flame" image offers non-literal resonance to sharing-without-harm question. Subtext in silences and implications avoids moralizing; complexity in elders' scars lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (rhythms as "second heartbeat"); voice poetic yet grounded, modulating rhythm with intensity (short sentences in flare). Dialogue distinct—ghost's echoing wisdom vs. Lumin's whisper; no head-hopping, elision purposeful in ghost's flicker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (long lyrical opens to punchy revelations); purposeful petal repetition as motif without loops. Minor figurative density ("teeth approximating infinity") coherent, no muddle in peak ghost exchange; strategic telling compresses Enclave history efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi generational trauma via fire-as-language in sentient garden; tropes (ghost mentor) transformed by gear's infinity/finitude and sonar cosmos. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; closure's spinning gear heightens stakes organically, no hedging.</comment>
