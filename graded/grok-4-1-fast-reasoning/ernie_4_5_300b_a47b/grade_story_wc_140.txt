<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines in perceptual filter ("colors bled into hues only he saw"), driving micro-choices like following voices; final identity shift earned via accumulated fragments with felt cost of erased past. Minor flaw: occasional diagnostic labels like "void where his memories should be" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density builds to CR closure via locket realization ("He *was* Marcus Hale"), reweighting premise with conspiracy cost; skeleton discovery tightens mosaic coherently. Orientation anchored early (containers, tides); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers constrain navigation/climbing (storm scramble narrows options); tides evolve pressure (high tide swallows tiers), charging final harbor stare. Sensory bias (salt tang, diesel/decay) POV-specific, mirrors internal void.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct identity) signaled early, escalates via density increase (fragments → clues) under Accumulative lens, culminating in agency-driven realization narrowing fear/void options. Cost legible in locket's "trembling" acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges from fragment mosaic, shifting to purposeful narrative without statement; final image ("He had a name. He had a history") offers resonant CR answer to identity void, embracing ambiguity of "why?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual signature ("sounds echoed as half-formed stories"); rhythmic diction modulates urgency (short storm sentences). Brief overheard dialogue natural/subtextual, advances fragment method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels (multi-job lines like ladder climb tying action/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in opener metaphors ("steel mountains") slightly muddles but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic fragment-collection transforms amnesia trope organically; container labyrinth as memory maze feels inevitable, risking bold perceptual lens that heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
