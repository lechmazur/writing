<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara's internal conflict between neat endings and messy vitality drives micro-choices like gripping the shell and deleting the chapter, earning her reconfiguration with felt cost of abandoning resolution. Strength in embodied emotions (shell warms, mist curls ankles). Minor slip: woman's smile as "stranger’s" underused for relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist/shapes density builds to CR closure when Clara deletes chapter, reweighting endings as doors with cost of foreclosed neatness ("its neat resolution crumbling into dust"). Orientation anchored early at dock. One tightening via lantern revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nexus mist and shell constrain choices (shell as key maps path, glows at end) and charge final image on desk. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (lucidly notes dissolving shapes). Evolves causally from curling ankles to parting curtain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (messy vs. clean endings) signaled early, tightens via woman's "endings aren’t walls—they’re doors," forcing renunciation with cost in reopened manuscript. Agency in following/rewriting under lens. Cost unmistakable in deleted chapter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fluid hope emerges organically from shell spiral/current images shifting meaning, resonant non-literal answer in ajar door without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from "collect shapes" question. Final line recharges priors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (lucidly watchful on fleeting shapes); voice rhythmic, modulates from watchful to embracing chaos. Dialogue subtextual ("You’re late"), advances plot. No head-hopping; diction fits novelist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm; mist/whisper patterns purposeful without loops. Minor figurative density ("kelp in a storm") in opener but thins under pressure. Closure image clear, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nexus as hope-collector with shell key transforms writer-block trope via feral logic. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight. Irreplaceable cameo tapestry charges closure.</comment>
