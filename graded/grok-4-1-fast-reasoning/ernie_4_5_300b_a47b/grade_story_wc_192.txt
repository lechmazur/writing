<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (isolation vs. urge to reach out) with micro-choices like knocking and brushing shadow; final grip earned by causal buildup, but "teach suffocating to breathe" edges toward diagnostic phrasing without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from knock to crossing; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "sanctuary shuddered" and "possibility of breath," reconfiguring isolation with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary, cold iron ring, and starlit threshold constrain choices (ring as conduit, threshold crossed) and charge final image of pulsing heartbeat; sensory details (smoke taste, burnt wood scent) mirror internal blur purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hold thresholds vs. suffocation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dialogue confrontation and crossing that forecloses isolation path; cost legible in shudder and risked balance, driven by Elara's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of mended scars vs. isolation emerges organically from knock, link, and hand-grip; final image resonant reweighting ("some bridges were meant to be rebuilt") answers without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in ongoing hold.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (shadows, scars as focus); dialogue natural/subtextual ("burned that bridge"), advances pressure; rhythm modulates from muffled knock to alive silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm, no loops/artifacts dulling propulsion; minor repetition of "fading threshold" taught as motif charging closure pulse, varied syntax supports emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scars-as-links and threshold guardian premise transformed through ring conduit and rebuild motif; risk in metaphorical fantasy feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
