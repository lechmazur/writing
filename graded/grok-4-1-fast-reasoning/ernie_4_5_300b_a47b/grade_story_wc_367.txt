<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied laughter and micro-choices like wick-twisting reveal contradictory light/dark impulses under wind pressure; final readiness earns endurance with felt isolation cost. Minor epiphanic summary in "dawn wasn’t just a time of day" slightly tidies ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wick adjustments build shadow density to alive visions and CR closure in lighthouse image resolving purpose. Orientation anchored by para 1; cost legible in "drowning in the dark" risk amid balcony tilt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse balcony edge and wind constrain tilting choice, charging final raise; ocean roar and glass panels mirror internal chaos purposefully. Recurrent lantern shadows evolve tactilely through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to shape dawn tightens accumulatively as shadows live and cling darkly, forcing stance via tilt agency; cost felt in gasped glimpses and steadying heartbeat pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Light/dark twins emerge organically from shadow mosaic to final lighthouse image reweighting role without moral; resonant choice-answer in "dawn... a choice" avoids platitude via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chimeric shadows and cackling rhythm modulates with flare intensity; stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety accelerates in flare burst ("world... white. Then, shadows burst"); high density weaves sensory action without loops, though light metaphors verge dense in peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prophetic wick-shadows transform routine trope into fresh post-print herald ingenuity; risk-taking lyric fantasy coheres, with dawn-choice reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
