<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clara's discerning eye spots the locket and drives micro-choices like gathering lore, with embodied reactions (trembling hands, tears at letters) earning the emotional payoff; limited internal contradiction prevents higher score, but motivation coheres under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as neighborhood stories build density to the mailbox click-open (DC) and unfinished letter (RR/CR with emotional cost in tears); orientation anchors early, one tightening via photo dates suffices, but summary skips slightly blur causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard's cobblestones and dawn gleam constrain discovery (locket in cracks) and charge final image; sensory details (damp earth, old paper) filter through Clara's priorities, mirroring her awakening curiosity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve mailbox) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through lore to combination dial; agency in listening forecloses force option, emotional cost legible in tears, but lacks deeper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of love's endurance via listening emerges organically from inscription, stories, and letters; final "testament to love’s endurance" resonates non-literally without moralizing, though end summary edges overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (history in overlooked); dialogue natural/subtextual (Mrs. Ruiz's low voice advances lore), rhythmic prose modulates calmly under rising curiosity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (swept near mailbox, noticed locket); varied rhythm propels, minor "one morning" repetition and paraphrase in lore beats dock slightly, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh thrift-lore synthesis transforms lost-love trope via communal stories and inscription twist; "leads through following" turn feels earned, avoids template familiarity without bold risks.</comment>
