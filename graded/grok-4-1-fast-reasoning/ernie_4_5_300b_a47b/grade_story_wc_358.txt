<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Anya's motivation rooted in mentor's death drives embodied micro-choices like pausing sensors and clutching the patch; interiority concrete via heartbeat-sync buzz. Strong earned shift in understanding convergence, but minor label-speak in "rapidly adapting mind" slightly flattens peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wind data to patch vibrations to engineer's revelation, landing CR closure where port becomes "hungry machine" with redesign cost legible in report. Orientation anchored early; single scene causality tight, minor ding for engineer's expository line not fully earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Containers funnel wind into vortices, constraining climb and gust reactions; sodium lights and gravel crunch selective via Anya's debris-reading lens. Final descent recharges labyrinth as awakened machine, environment shaping tactics and image perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map erratic winds for foresight) tightens accumulatively via gust/flicker/climb, narrowing to convergence discovery; agency in documenting under pressure forecloses ignorance with awareness cost. Escalation coherent under lens, but engineer's arrival borders convenient complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical awakening emerges organically from wind amplification and patch buzz; final "some machines...never truly sleep" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual vigilance cost. Subtext in responding wind avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (chaos as "breadcrumbs," wind as "feedback loop") biases via investigator lens; dialogue sparse but subtextual in engineer's "you felt it too." Rhythmic control modulates tension without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "gust slammed...45 mph"); varied rhythm propels to dawn. Minor overwrite in repeated vibration motifs dulls one peak beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological probe into sentient architecture via container vortices; convergence payoff inevitable from early winds/patch, transforming crash trope boldly without gimmick.</comment>
