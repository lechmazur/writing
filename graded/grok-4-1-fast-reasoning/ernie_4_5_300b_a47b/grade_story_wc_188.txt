<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in past failure culminate in earned resilience at the chamber ignition, with contradictory hope amid scars; minor backstory summary slightly abstracts the opening pause at the archway.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and pattern build to on-page CR closure—"shadows weren’t darkness, but the unlit potential"—with felt cost of past failure reconfigured in the blooming lilies' radiance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kerosene knot as micro-setting constrains choices (flares, placed on lily) and charges final image; vivid, selective sensory details (sulfur/rosemary, liquid light) filter through Lira's awareness without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of igniting hidden light tightens accumulatively via note and chamber discovery, narrowing to ignition with protagonist agency; cost legible in raw laugh defying past scars, though one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fire defying hopelessness emerges organically from particulars like mentor's knot and lilies; final image of fortress blooming reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of unlit potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (ambient awareness filtering hum/crackle); rhythmic, lyrical prose modulates intensity, prose-as-character in chant vibrations and flame sizzle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; purposeful fire metaphors cohere without muddle, though minor figurative density in chamber bloom brushes overwriting threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks craft, blooming fortress, and knot relic transforms failure-to-resilience arc; kerosene figure-eight and fire-lily chain reaction feel inevitable and riskily inventive.</comment>
