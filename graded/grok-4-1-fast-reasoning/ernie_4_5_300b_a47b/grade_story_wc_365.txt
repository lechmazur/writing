<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied conflict in shard's "throbbing like a second heartbeat" compel the hurling choice with visible cost (trembling hands); mother's eyes anchor relational pressure. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "weight of the withheld truth" slightly abstracts epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shard pull → portal → confrontation → hurling (DC) with cost in "hollow ache" and lingering ozone legible on final page. Orientation anchored early (visor, bay, shard); two-shard structure tightens via motivated jump.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visor's lattice and shard constrain choices (override caution, hurling); sensory hierarchy sharpens via POV (ozone, emerald light). Bay's evolution (rust to gleam) mirrors internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth via shard) tightens causally at "Not exactly" reversal, narrowing to renunciation with agency in hurling; cost felt in unsteady legs and "weight gone." One decisive escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-knife emerges organically via shard's pull vs. mother's "choice," culminating in final image's "quiet hum of possibility" as non-literal CR reweighting pursuit. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (visor colors, shard warmth); dialogue subtextual ("redirect") advances goal. Voice texture modulates rhythm under stress without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion; varied rhythm avoids loops, with strong verbs in peak ("hurled," "exploded"). Minor overwrite in opening "murmur... dreams" but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of multiverse trope via shard's "cyclically spontaneous" pull and job-specific visor; mother's nod risks emotional cliché but transforms via "not exactly." Bold closure renunciation heightens stakes.</comment>
