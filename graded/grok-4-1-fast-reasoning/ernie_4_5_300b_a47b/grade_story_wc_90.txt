<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pacifist motivation intensifies credibly through embodied fear (hands tremble, lighter when laughing), culminating in earned stitching choice with shadows as crucible. Internal conflict shows simultaneous avoidance and necessity via memories. Minor therapy-speak in AI line ("what if engagement is the only way") borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density breaks avoidance pattern into RR (Charged Poise) as door opens with locket shatter cost legible in "The locket flared... shadows coiled... dissolved." Orientation anchored early in ship decay. Single scene coherent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship and chamber holograms constrain via decay/shudders, charging closure as garden emerges. Sensory selective (humming air, viscous shadows). Object (locket/Tear) reweights final image. POV bias filters post-human familiarity without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save ship via shadow work) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through projected memories narrowing pacifist stance. Agency in "She pressed her palm... began to stitch" forecloses avoidance with fear/joy cost. Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (peace via courageous engagement) emerges organically from pacifist arc and shadow dissolution, resonant in garden invitation reweighting prior denial. Final image answers complexity without moral. Minor directness in AI/closing lines avoided full subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (quantum quirks, stitched reality). Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in climax ("shadows pooled... dissolved"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (AI whispers pressure). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "locket’s glow dimmed to a faint shimmer"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("droplet of liquid light trapped in a locket forged from a collapsed star") in opener, but purposeful and non-closure. No loops/artifacts dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms post-human pacifism/shadow work tropes via quantum DNA and relic synthesis, inevitable in stitching-as-understanding turn. Risky lyric sci-fi fresh, no derivative echoes. Bold conceptual integrity heightens closure stakes.</comment>
