<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority with embodied risk in "hands trembled" and bleeding memories, earning the final smile; contradictory impulses (proceed despite overwhelm) act on-page. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("synaptic plasticity—a method he’d theorized") slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with memory density building to RR closure in transformed mirror; cost legible in "his own memories bleeding into the mirror’s" during process. Single scene anchors orientation early ("moon hung low over the canyon"); no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Canyon and mirror constrain choices (shards as pathways, storm origin) and charge final rippling mosaic; sensory hierarchy (glinting shards, humming glass) reflects engineer's bias. Evolving details (fractures glow/seal) mirror internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (entangle memories via repair) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as alien memories surface then his bleed in, forcing persistence with felt overwhelm cost. Agency in "gritted teeth, adjusting dials" narrows options under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fusing fractured psyches emerges organically from memory mosaic and final "intertwined" voice; resonant non-literal answer in rippling mirror reweights abandonment without moralizing. Particulars like woman's whisper avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractal/rewiring diction); rhythmic control modulates tension in short, punchy process sentences. No head-hopping or elision issues; prose as character via engineer's precise chaos.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overwriting in process ("beam danced... liquid light") crowds peak beats without full pattern payoff, dulling propulsion slightly. No loops or scaffolds; clean syntax supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synaptic plasticity in glass transforms memory trope via canyon relics; risk in blurring selves heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from mirror's evolution.</comment>
