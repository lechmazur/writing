<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete, embodied post-transplant perception ("every shadow, every ripple of light, had taken on a new weight"); contradictory caution versus hunger drives micro-choices like releasing the wing. Final realization earned via prior sensory buildup, foreclosing prior self with felt duality cost. No safety-hedging or label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from wing release to light-tracing to travelers' tale climax; on-page CR closure ("the donor heart had not just given her a second chance... a new lens") reconfigures premise with undeniable integration cost in final image of smiling amid mist-damp patrons. Orientation anchored early; no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via purposeful light trails guiding movement ("followed the light... like a beacon") and charges closure image (mist burning away as tea house becomes "stage"); sensory hierarchy dye-master specific (indigo pigment, obsidian like "wet ink"). Micro-setting (terrace railing, vial) tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand story-magnetizers) signaled early, tightens via wing-flare reversal amid travelers' climax, forcing realization-stance under Accumulative lens; agency in release/following forecloses isolation with conceptual cost legible in "two people" duality. One decisive deepening suffices, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stories as "invisible threads" emerges organically from wing/light particulars, reweighting premise in CR ending without moralizing ("some stories are meant to be shared"); final image resonates as non-literal answer to why some magnetize narratives. Counter-reading (caution's cost) lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (light/pigment as "stolen secret," "tiny, angry star"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in realization beat. Prose texture character-specific, no filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "glowed like a tiny, angry star" advances plot/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm accelerates in wing-flare climax, no loops/artifacts/muddle. Read-aloud propulsion flawless through closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of transplant awakening + mythic wing in floating tea house transforms "second chance" trope into story-magnet inquiry; risk of lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes via iridescent light-map payoff. Inevitable hindsight from early particulars.</comment>
