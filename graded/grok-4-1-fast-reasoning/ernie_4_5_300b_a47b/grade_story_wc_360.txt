<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's arc from analytical detachment to embodied feeling is earned through causal buildup, with contradictory impulses peaking when he inhabits Veyra's loneliness. Micro-choices like reciting the Möbius poem reveal values under pressure. Veyra applies targeted opposition without diluting focus. Minor slip in epiphany speed at "Emotions weren’t variables; they were wildfires" slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: experiment (poem/gibberish) → fragment flare → empathy merge → realization, with legible before/after in CR closure ("rhythms to be felt"; fragment settles). Orientation anchored early ("Topaz Workshop... halo fragment"). One tightening via disorientation narrows options to merger cost. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Halo fragment as micro-setting constrains choices (imprinted page, hover) and charges final image (settles in palm). Sensory details like "burnt sapphire and iron filings" filter via Elias's priorities, evolving causally (flares, hues). Spatial choreography clear amid chaos. Workshop guides proximity for press positioning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mathematize emotion) signaled early, tightens causally via disorientation to merger reversal, narrowing to realization with felt cost (detachment crumbles, tears). Agency in poem/press drives escalation. Veyra's pressure coherent. One micro-turn allowed doesn't dilute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (emotions as felt rhythms, not equations) emerges organically from experiment failure, reweighted in CR ("mathematics... rhythms to be felt"). Final image (fragment in palm, softened scowl) resonates non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in Veyra's "mirror" warning pays off. Particulars like gibberish poem avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (equations, sine waves). Voice modulates rhythmically to climax chaos, diction character-specific (Möbius syntax). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re just making noise"). No head-hopping; elision of fragment defense taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (e.g., "sine waves of joy") without muddle in peak ("kaleidoscope of memories"). Minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Propulsion aligns with causal beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress transposes celestial empathy, transforming alchemical tropes via specific mechanics (gibberish page). Risky ambiguity tactic heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in CR reweighting. No derivative echoes.</comment>
