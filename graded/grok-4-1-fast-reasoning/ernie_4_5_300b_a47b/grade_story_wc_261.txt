<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode scars drives micro-choices like tracing rings, with embodied conflict in aching scar and tears; internal shift from pain to pride earned via visions. Minor slip in generic "stories etched in flesh" phrasing slightly abstracts embodiment at key reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory shards building density to CR closure: sand visions reprice scars as bridges, cost legible in "opened wounds instead" and reliving crash. Tunnel shards taught early (~25% mark), transitions via rings legible; orientation anchored by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coffee-ring mosaic and frosted hourglass constrain descent and charge shattering finale; sensory selectivity (hum in teeth, fogging breath) mirrors raw post-anesthesia state. Scar as micro-setting evolves tactilely, guiding choices without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar-reading for closure) signaled para 1, tightens accumulatively through intensifying visions that force trauma reliving before future glimpse; agency in persistent ring-tracing pays cost in burning scar and gasps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scars-as-maps motif shifts via mother's words to "bridges," emergent from visions without statement; final sand-future image resonantly reweights grief premise obliquely. Avoids moralizing, lingers via plant coda.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature (plants' Morse code, coffee stains as portals) biases toward scar/map obsession; rhythmic modulation accelerates in tunnel shards, compression purposeful under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "tunnel opened beneath her, not of earth but of memory"); zero loops, varied syntax propels to "sand swirled, forming images." No artifacts dull closure shatter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coffee-ring portals and plant telepathy synthesize magical grief realism organically; tunnel visions transform closure trope via scar-future payoff, risk of surreal shards pays off in inevitable epiphany.</comment>
