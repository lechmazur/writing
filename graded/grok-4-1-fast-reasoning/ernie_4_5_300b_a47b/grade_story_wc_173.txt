<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to defy conformity is consistent and intensifies through dance, rooted in refusal of the lullaby shown in reflective memory. Interiority poetic but lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; emotions embodied in breath and movement yet idealized without raw flaws complicating peak choices. Final unburdening feels earned by dance effort but misses visible cost on a flawed character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dance builds density from slow coaxing to urgent sweeps, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration (door opens, echoes freed) with felt cost in physical exertion. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/sanctuary. Single scene coherent; closure image of lighter steps reconfigures defiance with undeniable price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism walls and snow constrain dance choice and charge final image, refracting shadows during unraveling and persisting in testament to defiance. Sensory vivid and selective: crunching snow mirrors heartbeat, frost-kissed glass tactile. Atmosphere purposeful, mirroring internal rebellion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock via dance to harvest echoes) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as threads glow and movements urgent, narrowing to final fling with breath cost. Agency in bodily choices forces climax; defiance deepens under conformity pressure. One tightening sufficient, cost legible in "breath came faster."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of quiet defiance emerges organically from dance rebellion against conformity, resonant in final image of carried symphony shifting world "just slightly." Subtext in ghostly touches and unbroken chorus avoids moralizing; complexity in chaste form's bold expression lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (poetic body as loom/shuttle) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from slow to urgent. Prose texture distinct in refracted imagery, consistent diction fits courtesan's grace. No head-hopping; elision of mechanics taught via dance progression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Density high with multi-job lines, but dense metaphors border overwriting in climax ("threads snapped free, unraveling into a cascade of light"); minor paraphrase loops like repeated "threads" phrasing dull propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion steps with dance urgency. Closure image clear despite figurative load.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaste courtesan dancing poetically to harvest echoes transforms trope into rebellion loom; prism/threads ingenuity inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick; defiance calculus non-obvious yet grounded.</comment>
