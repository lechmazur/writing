<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's pride in knowledge contradicts her need to admit ignorance at the guardian confrontation, earning the closure choice with embodied cost in clutching the diary and offering expertise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore navigation (orchid drop to map find to decode); Charged Poise closure lands on-page as they step inside, reconfiguring her stance with felt ignorance cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shifting sentient shelves constrain choices (sidestepping spider book, decoding velvet spines), charging the final symphony swell; micro-objects like blue orchid and diary evolve tactilely through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reach library tightens via guardian's proof demand, forcing agency in intuitive decoding; cost legible in pride trade-off, narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of ignorance-discovery emerges organically from diary gaps mirroring blind spots, resonating in non-literal final chorus without moralizing; reweights premise via Elara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (linguist notices dialects, grooves); voice modulates rhythmically, distinguishing guardian's parchment voice from Elara's muttered charms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion (humming tune unravels shelf) without loops; minor overwriting in "unheard symphony" metaphors slightly muddles peak guardian beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms maze tropes via cipher gaps and linguist intuition; renegotiate turn feels inevitable from ash note, risking pride for knowledge without gimmickry.</comment>
