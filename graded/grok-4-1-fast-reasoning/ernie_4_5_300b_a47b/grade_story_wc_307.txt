<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's withholding creates internal tension between teaching and letting Lira struggle, earning her nod of approval; backwards aging ties to identity flux shown in "past selves" reflection. Lira's desperation compounds via nightly returns, revealing character through action. Minor slip in stock poetic interiority ("curiosity of youth") but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ripple patterns building to Lira's spiral insight and Elara's nod (CR closure reweighting vanishing as becoming). Montage elision ("Days passed, then weeks") taught early, tightens to one decisive apprentice throw. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; felt cost in earned patience legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto and platform constrain trance and stone throws, charging closure spiral under starlight. Sensory bias (humming stones, bioluminescent moss) reflects Elara's priorities, vivid without stall. Fractal ripples evolve causally, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach vanishing via patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through Lira's desperate questions to her autonomous stone throw narrowing interpretive options. Cost felt in withheld knowledge forcing Lira's self-earned "becoming" realization. Single tightening sufficient, charges final helix image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of delayed revelation emerges via withheld truth and ripple shifts, resonating in Lira's "becoming" without direct statement. Final sentence ("delayed revelation had arrived") echoes thesis overtly, flattening subtext (-0.6); counterbalanced by earned image complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV, perceptual signature poetic/selective ("starlight pooled like liquid mercury"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("What does it mean?"), advances via Elara's cryptic reply. Rhythmic control modulates from meditative hush to insight peak without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peaks ("ripples spread... in fractal patterns, each wave a mirror"), muddling propulsion (-0.6); minor paraphrase loops in descriptions ("withholding... letting it drip"). Rhythm varies but template poeticism ("gleamed like spun silver") jars slightly. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Backwards-aging researcher bending time inward via magnetic fractals transforms trope organically; Lira's helix realization feels inevitable from pattern accumulation. Bold lyric accumulation risks static repetition but heightens stakes via apprentice agency.</comment>
