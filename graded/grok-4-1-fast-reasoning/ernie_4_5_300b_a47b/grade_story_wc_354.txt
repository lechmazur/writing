<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act via chess memory clashing with exile resolve, earning the seed-planting renunciation; interiority concrete in "teeth ache" and palm chill. Final choice forecloses doubt with felt cost of hopeful melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as nexus vibrations and stone glow densify to RR closure in sapling sprout; cost legible in "hopeful melancholy warming his chest." Orientation anchored early at nexus edge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nexus hum aching teeth and warping pull constrain stone placement and charge final seed-planting image; sensory selection (chill seep, roar) mirrors internal silence translation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to correlate covenant tightens accumulatively via glow and visions narrowing to key insertion; agency in pressing palm and planting forecloses forgotten oath path with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sapling as "quiet correlation" reweights queen's constraint theme non-literally, emerging from stone-chess particulars without statement; ambiguity in covenant questions lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters via chess ("silence between moves"); rhythmic control heightens in nexus roar to mage fade, POV stable without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in "dent shifted, edges softening into keyhole"; varied rhythm, no loops or muddle, purposeful metaphors integrate without overwriting peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious chess-constellation board and dent-keyhole synthesis feels inevitable from silence translation; transforms exile trope via stardust seed risk without gimmick.</comment>
