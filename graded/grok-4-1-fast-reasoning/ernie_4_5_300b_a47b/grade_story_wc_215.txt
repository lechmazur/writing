<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel speaking, but internal conflict summarized rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene; final change earned yet lacks embodied contradiction under stress, as in trembling hands before touching box.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to cadence shift at glow and "Speak" message; on-page RR (Charged Poise) lands with legible emotional cost in "heart light for the first time in years"; orientation anchored early in wasteland oasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stained glass box as recurring object constrains gaze/touch choices and charges shattering final image; sensory details (brittle honeycombs, pulsing glass) selectively mirror internal isolation; wasteland subtly pressures solitude without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vs. release unspoken words) signaled early, tightens via ghosts' boldness and "Speak" imperative forcing renunciation; agency in touching/speaking forecloses silence with visible cost (shattered box, fading ghosts).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words' burden emerges organically from box images and speaking act, reweighting silence-to-voice without moralizing; final shards scattering offers resonant non-literal answer, though minor risk of tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of tranquilly perceptive noticing (light through glass, dust crevices); rhythmic modulation builds to peak stress in "voice rough, unused"; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates setting/action; minor paraphrase loop in "spoke of love, of loss, of regret" but doesn't obscure closure; purposeful lyricism avoids artifacts in peak shatter moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic ghosts, beekeeping oasis, and glass-trapped words transforms tropes via perceptual recluse; risk-taking in mute-to-eloquent arc heightens stakes organically to shattering release.</comment>
