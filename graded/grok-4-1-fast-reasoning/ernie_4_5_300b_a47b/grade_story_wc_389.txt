<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and visionary traits drive micro-choices like activating the mirrors; loneliness as flaw compounds isolation without tidy resolution. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract emotional progression before peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of transmissions building to Charged Poise closure; hourglass sand defying gravity ("the sand began to swirl") delivers legible conceptual cost of rewritten time. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt portico and hourglass constrain choices (palm press, mirror activation) and charge final glowing image; storm sensory hierarchy narrows to vibrations under crisis. POV-filtered details like "drowned skies" integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harnessing prophetic storm tightens via radio bursts and prismatic activation under Accumulative lens; agency in mechanism use forecloses isolation path with felt roar cost. Abstract early stakes gain visceral charge late.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-order allegiance emerges organically from particulars like sand reversal and layered voice; final "You are the prism. You are the storm" reconfigures premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of prophetic bias; rhythmic modulation peaks in gritty laugh and chord vibration. Diction controlled, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; purposeful figurative layering fits voice without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in "ancient shadows" motif slightly dull mid-section before payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-prophet and storm-prism transforms isolation trope; risk in gritty-whimsy voice heightens stakes, inevitable in final reconfiguration.</comment>
