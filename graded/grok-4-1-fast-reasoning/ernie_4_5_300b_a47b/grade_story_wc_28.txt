<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (mercy vs. steel) acting in the tessera placement; final endurance earned via retrocognitive visions constraining his resolve. "Aberrant mercy" mantra reveals hierarchy of values under loss pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of past/present flickers builds to CR closure in "tessera’s waves rippling outward," reweighting destruction into rebirth with conceptual cost of unundoable past legible in final sky image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shattered sky and ash/ozone anchor vividly, filtered through Elias's retrocognition; tessera/steppe stone recur as micro-setting constraining the renaming act and charging final ripple image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebirth via mercy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in tessera fit foreclosing erasure path; agency in placement crystallizes stance with felt resignation cost in "he had not stopped the fire."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of scarred transformation emerges organically from tessera/mosaic particulars, final "sky seemed to soften" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (retrocognitive slips like artisan vision); rhythmic lyricism modulates with pressure, diction biased toward paradox (warm coldness).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("stars burned like fractured glass") contained, no loops dulling closure ripple image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition and mosaic renaming transforms post-fire rebirth trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive inevitable in hindsight via chipped patterns payoff.</comment>
