<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between logic and wonder act in scene via playing the cello despite doubt; final renunciation of debunking earned by sync of hums and ache in chest. Reimagining conversations anchors reflection with micro-choices tilting present stakes. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hums/vibrations builds to CR closure in glowing note and worldview shift, with cost legible in "ache in her chest" and foreclosed debunking path. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. Experimental reflection interleaves without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory, shell, and cello constrain choices (shell on bridge triggers hum) and charge final dome/sky image. Sensory details (dust motes, keening hum) selective via Lira's priorities. Micro-setting of control panel dials evolves causally, mirroring internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven hum sync narrowing debunk/feel options under Accumulative lens. One tightening in dials spinning forces realization; cost unmistakable in sound cutoff and chest ache charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmony over decoding emerges organically from cello/shell sync; final hum/sky image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting logic-to-wonder arc. No moralizing until integrated CR; ambiguity lingers in "not meant to be decoded... felt."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in myth-busting lens (stars "out of tune"); rhythmic control heightens hum-building pressure. Voice modulates from muttered logic to grinning wonder without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in peak hum escalation; metaphors purposeful (e.g., "fossilized question") without muddle. Minor lyrical density in opener doesn't obscure causality; zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of music/cosmic riddle via shell/cello feels inevitable; transforms myth-busting trope through grounded empathy. Risky Accumulative lyricism heightens stakes in hummed descent.</comment>
