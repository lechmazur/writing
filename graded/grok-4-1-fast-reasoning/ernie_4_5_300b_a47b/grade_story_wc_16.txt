<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust intensifies through embodied parallels like throat tightening on the love letter translation; contradictory impulses in "carefully reckless" grin balance competence and vulnerability. Final call earned by prior work causality with relational cost. Minor diagnostic lean in "symphony of truth" epiphany at call doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: translation density builds to Charged Poise closure in phone call, reweighting silence with cost legible in "heart a river finally unblocked." One tightening via manuscript handover narrows to sister dialogue; orientation anchored early in archive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass ink well handled early (desk rune-tracing) and reprise charges final image ("clutched in her hand"), constraining packing choice; archive hum (static, mothballs, dust motes) mirrors internal states via POV filter. Sensory selection purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust) signaled early via crumpled invite, deepens accumulatively through translations paralleling silence; agency in call crystallizes stance under lens, foreclosing dammed-river path with vulnerability cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust-as-language emerges implicitly from letter ("Do not dam it with silence") to manuscript ("hearts speak in belonging"), final image resonantly reconfiguring silence without moral statement. Particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with linguistic perceptual signature (e.g., "unsnarled the first knot"); dialogue natural/subtextual, Henrik's "trust enough to be vulnerable?" pursuing goal. Rhythmic control modulates intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels night work; no loops or artifacts dull closure, minor simile density ("labyrinth mind," "gravel voice") coherent in voice-motivated pattern. Propulsion clear in translation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Languages-as-symphonies/promises premise fresh, transforming linguistic trope into trust restoration arc; final reconfiguration via sister manuscript inevitable from particulars, risk in recursive decoding heightens stakes.</comment>
