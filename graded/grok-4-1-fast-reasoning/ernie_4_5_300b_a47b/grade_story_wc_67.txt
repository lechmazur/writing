<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to crystallize emotion roots consistently in traits like using ash for incomplete portraits, with embodied ache "puls[ing] in her chest like a second heart." Internal conflict emerges in contradictory impulses to confront safety's illusion while wearing the mask as armor. Removal of mask at climax earns closure via prior micro-choices under Elias's pressure, foreclosing full revelation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from grinding to sprinkling to touching portrait, culminating in Charged Poise RR where unfinished ash silhouette reconfigures art's temporality with conceptual cost in "shadows swallowing the portrait." Orientation anchors early in gallery and Lira's process; single scene fits defaults with one tightening via Elias's warning narrowing her resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vanishing point gallery vividly pressures choices—art "dissolve[s] if you stare too long," mirroring internal states and constraining Lira's ambition. Mask as micro-setting recurs tactilely, biting skin at end to charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (soot-smudged fingers, echoing footsteps) filters through her biased perception without generic catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to crystallize emotion signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritualistic sprinkling and Elias's wary "You're chasing ghosts," forcing stance crystallization. One deepening narrows options in mask removal, with visible cost of unfinished portrait foreclosing permanence. Pressure coheres texturally to closure without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art's illusory preservation emerges organically from ash incompleteness and gallery's fading works, reweighted in final "ash on her hands glittering like stardust" without moralizing. Subtext in mask's "resin and regret" implies relational voids; ambiguity lingers in "not sure who 'you' is," inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in soot-shadowed details; voice modulates poetically yet legibly under pressure. Dialogue subtextual—"Ghosts are all we have"—pursues goals, distinguishing Elias's wiry caution from Lira's muffled resolve. No head-hopping; diction reflects her conduit mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short ritualistic sentences accelerating to close, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("shadows pool and fade, as though the very architecture resents permanence") risks density in opening. No loops, but paraphrase of impermanence ("nothing lasts, but everything matters") repeats texturally without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash portraits in vanishing gallery transforms impermanence trope via Lira's specific method, with risk-taking in surreal architecture heightening stakes organically. Final reconfiguration of rocking chair/mask feels inevitable from established pattern, avoiding templates.</comment>
