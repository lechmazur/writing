<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kail's jittery traits embodied in frayed nerves and hesitation before planting compel the closure realization; internal conflict via Veyra echoes acts simultaneously with relic hum, earning change without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: vibrations → encounter → planting → sapling CR with cost (pendant stills, absence roots); orientation anchored by ridgeway/aurora in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora colors and frost-cracked stone constrain planting choice, charging final sapling image; sensory hierarchy (hum in palm, misted breath) reflects Kail's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relic purpose) tightens accumulatively via intensifying vibrations and hesitant agency in kneeling/planting; cost legible in trembling stone and stilled pendant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encounters-as-seeds emerges organically from planting and "Kail...had been the soil," reweighting Veyra's absence without statement; final image resonates non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias (pendant "urging" via hum); dialogue subtextual ("You extend brief encounters") pursues goals; rhythm modulates from jittery clauses to poised closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; "Roots erupted, thin and silver" propels climax without loops; minor repetition of Veyra echoes purposeful, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic vibrations germinating memory transforms courier trope; risk in cryptic method pays off in sapling CR without late rules.</comment>
