<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's internal conflict peaks concretely when she hesitates to touch the hellebore, embodying her control flaw; micro-choice to withdraw hand earns her final renunciation with felt cost to her prior methods.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from linden leaf observation to hellebore metamorphosis to vines, delivering CR closure at "I’m going to help them by releasing control," reweighting her nursery vision with conceptual cost of past stifling.</comment>
