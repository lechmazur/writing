<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation rooted in childhood stories and grandmother's negative drives consistent micro-choices like sifting ashes and burning the strip, with embodied reactions ("throat tightened," "fingers trembled") revealing internal conflict over legacy. Final endurance of burden as "the map" earns closure change with visible cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in hesitation before burning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early anchoring of Lira in ivy-veiled passage post-climate shift; density builds via discoveries to CR closure ("You are the map" whisper reconfigures dreams as intertwined). Burning negative provides legible cost in final image; no orientation debt, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage constrains via narrowing, shifting stones ("groan reverberated... stones grinding like teeth"), and parting to reveal alcove, charging final locket image. Sensory details (wet earth/iron smell, moss under boots) filtered through cartographer's perceptual bias integrate purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("discover what walls dream about") signaled early tightens accumulatively via diary revelations and groan, forcing renunciation (burning negative) with felt cost ("legacy’s burden... carry them forward"). Agency in sifting and placing strip forecloses path; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of intertwined dreams/legacy emerges organically from particulars (diaries' "walls hum," burning negative parallels grandmother's relic); final locket photo and whisper offer resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise via "You are the map."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with cartographer's perceptual signature (tremors in palm, textures in fingers); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically ("passage curved like a question mark") without filter excess or head-hopping. Compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short groan sentences build tension); metaphors consistent and voice-motivated ("corridor’s face—a mosaic of cracks"). No loops or scaffolds; minor density in opening descriptions purposeful for atmosphere, not overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living architecture and echo cartography transforms tropes (haunted house to dreaming walls); risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off in inevitable CR ("The corridor’s echo had found its voice"), heightening stakes via perceptual ingenuity.</comment>
