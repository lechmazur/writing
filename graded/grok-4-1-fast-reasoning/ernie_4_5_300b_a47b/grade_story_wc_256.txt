<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to feel connection is concrete and intensifies through embodied actions like tracing symbols, with internal conflict in hesitation at the cave shown via mantra recall. Micro-choices under pressure, like pressing the lens, reveal values with cost. Minor label-speak in "powerfully gentle" mantra slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lens activates hologram, leads to cave discovery, reweighting sound as tangible via scratches-as-grooves. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. CR closure in "connection wasn’t something to be engineered" with conceptual cost of forgotten listening, legible in final bell-ring image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carbide lens as micro-setting constrains choices (fits groove, unlocks cave) and charges final warm-palm hold. Sensory details like damp earth and bone-vibrating hum selective via Lira's priorities. Cave carvings mirror equations, evolving with action without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover texture) signaled early, escalates texturally via hum-to-melody deepening that narrows engineering assumption. Agency in venturing despite grid collapse, cost felt in trembling risk and foreclosed brute-force path. Climax discovery forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of felt connection emerges via particulars like lens grooves encoding song, reweighted in final "symphony of contradictions" without statement. Subtext in cave-as-instrument implies listening cost. Resonant non-literal answer in mountain's hum taking center stage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (sound textures via bell-ringer lens). Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically, e.g., shortening under cave tension. Minimal dialogue natural, subtextual in Voss's awe; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, e.g., "scratches... encoding the mountain’s song" advances plot and theme. Varied rhythm, no loops, though minor overwriting in repeated "golden shadows." Clean syntax propels to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-mining relic unlocking natural instrument transforms trope of lost tech. Risk in artificial pilgrimage paying off via mountain's voice feels inevitable. No derivative templates; voice commits to sonic textures.</comment>
