<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied tension (trembling fingers, racing heart) and micro-choices like embellishing with moonlight reveal dual beautician-mortician traits under pressure, earning the triumphant slump; minor flaw in competent execution without deeper contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density builds to crack fissures then seals via unconventional humming; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "exhausted but triumphant" with felt exhaustion cost and reconfigured peace, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pool's obsidian runes and bioluminescent moss constrain infusion tactics and charge final smooth surface image; sensory selectivity (shimmering air, aurora pulses syncing breath) mirrors urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save Elion's echo) tightens accumulatively via pattern emergence to pool cracks, forcing agency in embellishment; visible cost (grotto collapse risk, exhaustion) charges ending but lacks sharper moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty's endurance emerges organically from embellished preservation against oblivion, resonant in final aurora kiss without moralizing; final image reweights spark-capturing as peace amid impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lush, biased noticing (fraying motes, fractal static) with rhythmic modulation under stress; stable close third-person POV, no dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax in peak crack moment, but minor overwriting in stacked light metaphors ("blinding white," "steady, warm glow") slightly dulls immediacy without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beautician-mortician in cosmic echo-weaving transforms death tropes via patterns-in-static ingenuity; risk-taking in embellishment heightens stakes organically.</comment>
