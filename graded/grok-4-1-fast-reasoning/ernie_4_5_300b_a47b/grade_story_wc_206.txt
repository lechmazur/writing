<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices with tools reveal expertise under moral pressure; Lira's crumpling face and confession embody contradictory regret, earning change with cost, though some creed exposition feels diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tool adjustments therefore prompt confession therefore stone flares with legible emotional cost in widow's admission; single scene oriented early, closure RR via truth-tether reconfigures box.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains repair via amplifying hum and dais; sensory hierarchy (vibrations, thickened air) filters through Elias's tactile focus, charging final chord shake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (moral realignment of box) tightens via confession reversal narrowing to truth admission; agency in Elias's weaving and Lira's reveal forecloses deception path with on-page flare cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth honoring cracks emerges organically via stone mirror and final melody tether; resonant CR in "let them breathe" image reweights shadows without moralizing, though Elias's explanations border echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature in gear-tracing; dialogue subtext advances (Lira's "What truth?" pursues stakes); rhythmic prose modulates from hum to blooming note.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, sound without loops or scaffolds; varied syntax propels from whine to crystalline note, zero figurative muddle in peak confession beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy-repair synthesis via rust covenant and reverse-spinning gears transforms tropes; risk in moral causality heightens closure, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
