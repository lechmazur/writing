<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Withdrawn knight's silence shatters in earned laughter after string-snapping choice, with contradictory dread/euphoria embodied in "shivering bliss" driving micro-choices; interiority particular via alchemist memory surfacing on touch; final renunciation of capture costs stasis-breaking glow and unarmored freedom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (program underline → string snap → descent) builds to CR closure in "The shape of possibility was not a thing to be captured... a dance," with felt cost in dissolving greenhouse and blank pages; orientation anchored early; one tightening via orb shatter reconfigures reality on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse's vines, machinery, and glass constrain choices (pulse on palm press, whir on string tug, rotate to stairs); sensory selectivity (moon-petals scent, crystallized breath) mirrors internal shifts; recurring program charges final blank-page image with irreplaceable tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture possibility) signaled early crystallizes via agency in unsnapping, narrowing to descent with textural escalation (reality warps intensify); cost legible in unarmored glow and crumbling ruins charging poise; no coincidence resolution, pressure coheres accumulatively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of living patterns over capturing emerges organically from alchemist failure to Cedric's dance realization, reweighting program inscription without statement; final wheat-field image resonates with prior vine motifs, embracing ambiguity in "strings were never meant to hold you."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in mystical filters ("reality shifted... like heat haze"); rhythmic diction modulates from foggy breath to roaring allegiance under stress; purposeful compression in shifts taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "strings resisted, then snapped with a sound like breaking bone"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative coherence in "vines pulsed... flaring violet" integrates without muddle in peak snaps and descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms puppet-trope into reality-bending alchemy via program/program shifts; fresh "factually mystical" synthesis risks bold dissolution for earned CR; no template echoes, particulars (mirror-shard eyes, orb moments) feel inevitable hindsight.</comment>
