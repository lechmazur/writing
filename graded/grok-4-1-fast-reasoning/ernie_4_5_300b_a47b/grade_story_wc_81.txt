<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to trace origins intensifies through precise actions like sketching grooves; embodied via throat tightening at journal; minor slip in lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses during door beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with discovery density tightening to CR closure in "truth—raw, unvarnished, and heavy," reweighting city myth with undeniable emotional cost; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bloated shelves, submerged door grooves, and bioluminescent jars constrain stamp choice and charge vault image; sensory selection reflects indexer POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honest origins signaled early, deepens via journal under accumulative lens with one tightening at door open; cost legible in "throat tightened" and heavy truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of denial vs truth emerges organically from journal entries; final "some darknesses... become light" offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tranquilly perceptive perceptual signature; rhythmic poetic texture modulates from gloom to resolve without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel well; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "blackout crept... thief" slightly dulls opening propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stamp-as-key vault opener ingeniously transforms sunken city trope; fresh synthesis of indexer ritual with truth quest feels organic and risky.</comment>
