<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara's face-blindness concretely shapes perception and choices like sketching textures, earning the final "throat tightened" realization; Voss applies relational pressure without stereotypes. Minor label-speak in "methodical nature demanded answers" slightly abstracts motivation without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon seeds quarry visit, discoveries (handprint, locket) densify pattern of opposites toward CR closure in portrait/locket image with felt emotional cost ("throat tightened"). Single scene oriented early; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and quarry constrain actions (unstable site, dragged indentation) and charge final image (hush as benediction, portrait etched into stone). Sensory details (damp stone, lantern flicker) selectively mirror internal states through Clara's biased texture-focus without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unify ribbon's meaning via empathy) signaled early, texturally escalates through joint tracing/handprint to locket deepening; agency in handing charcoal/sketching forecloses "cold" options with emotional cost legible in "throat tightened." Minor abstractness in stakes declaration vs. visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites/empathy emerges organically from ribbon-stone merges, handprint marks, to portrait's "death and life"; final image reconfigures cold case premise without moralizing. Subtle counter-reading in Voss's skepticism enriches without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Clara POV with perceptual signature (texture/shadow bias); voices distinct (Voss's rasped weariness vs. Clara's precise corrections). Dialogue goal-driven (challenging art/logic) advances without exposition; rhythm modulates hush to quickened pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel toward closure; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (mist as skin, ribbon as vein). Minor overwriting in opening simile stack slightly slows entry, but purposeful for atmospheric hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's textural empathy transforms cold case trope into fresh synthesis; opposites pattern feels inevitable, risks bold POV constraint heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
