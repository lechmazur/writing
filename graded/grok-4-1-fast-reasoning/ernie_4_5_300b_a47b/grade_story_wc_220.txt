<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hush's motivation to bind the settlement is consistent and intensifies through riddle-solving choices, earning her purpose shift; embodied via nose-tracing actions. Minor slip: anthropomorphic intuition lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal riddle beats, reading more declarative than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: riddle density builds from individual to collective, culminating in CR closure with leaf's display reweighting isolation; cost felt in "cracked world" image. Orientation anchored early under harvester; one tightening via escalating riddles suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scrapyard details (rusted harvester, corrugated shack, cracked fissures) constrain Hush's sensory navigation and charge final leaf image; sensory hierarchy via nose privileges scent over sight. Environment mirrors thematic binding, evolving from wild to humming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate distance to closeness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through riddle resolutions narrowing isolation; agency in Hush's groove-tracing forecloses disconnection with settlement's cheer as felt cost. One deepening at "love" riddle suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared memory forging closeness emerges organically from riddle particulars (memory as binder, grooves as silent song); final leaf image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in pauses/grooves implies without stating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Hush with perceptual signature (nose twitching, intuitive vibes); voice texture poetic yet grounded, modulating from wild to connective hum. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven (Jeb's "secrets"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "nose following grooves like a map" advances action/character/setting); rhythm varies for dawn crescendo. Minor metaphor pile-up in closing ("tapestry," "threads," "hum") borders overwrite but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retired bloodhound "reading" post-war phonograph riddles transforms wasteland tropes into connective ritual; risk in animal agency pays off inevitably at leaf symbol. No derivative echoes; bold perceptual ingenuity heightens stakes.</comment>
