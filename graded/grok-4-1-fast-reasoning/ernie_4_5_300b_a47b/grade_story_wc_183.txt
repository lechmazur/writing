<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chimera traits vividly embodied in actions (wing brushing petal, scales chilling) and dialogue distinctions (growl-hiss vs. murmurs), driving conflicted quest; Veyra's skepticism pressures Lira's choices, earning relational shift at "perfectly so." Final wholeness feels motivated by prior symbiosis tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog density, tune-triggered door, seed sprouting layer revelations to CR closure where garden reconfigures myth as choice, with ship's vanishing as legible cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via hidden door suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog, calliope keys, nameplates constrain choices (pressing key opens door, card on pedestal sprouts vines) and charge final meadow image; sensory selectivity (creaking timbers, salt-caked keys) mirrors forgotten decay, evolving causally to sunlit reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden quest) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Veyra's doubt and room discovery, narrowing skepticism to acceptance; agency in humming tune and placing card forces revelation, with ship's erasure as visible cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges organically from name-flowers and sewing act, reweighting "myth" via CR without statement; aberration motif shifts from pejorative to affirming in final flower, lingering ambiguity in fog's promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable Lira focalization with perceptual bias (tracing card as compass); dialogue goal-driven (Veyra's jabs test resolve) and subtextual ("trapped freedom" evolves); rhythmic prose modulates from foggy chill to meadow hum without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (vines curling to nameplates); varied rhythm propels descent to bloom, minor metaphor density ("whispering of better days") in opener purposeful but borders overwrite. No loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chimera symbiosis on carnival ship yields fresh synthesis of decay/myth, transforming tropes via garden-as-choice; risk in fused twins' voices/visions heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at sewn flower.</comment>
