<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction shines in embodied reactions like "voice brittle" and "laughed, a sound like gravel," earning her shift to hope; J.T. pressures via relationship crucible. Minor slip: final vow feels slightly over-tidy without deeper micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from descent to visions; orientation anchored early via baseball and map. Closure as CR lands cleanly in vow and final image—"The journey was enough"—with legible conceptual cost of carrying past weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake vividly constrains wading and seeps into skin, mirroring internal states; pulses blue moss and "liquid light" charge final baseball glow. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relearn empathy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shattering mother-reflection that forecloses path with felt cost. J.T. crystallizes stance; agency in reaching/vowing endures with price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from visions/mosaic paths to resonant CR: "not to erase, but to understand," reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like shattered image avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("glow seeping into her skin"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Why show me this?"). Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; similes like "drowned stars" purposeful in lyric mode without muddle. Minor overwrite in "rustle of autumn leaves" voice, but no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of regret-lake nexus and signed baseball transforms time-travel trope; risk in metaphorical labyrinth pays off in inevitable CR hindsight.</comment>
