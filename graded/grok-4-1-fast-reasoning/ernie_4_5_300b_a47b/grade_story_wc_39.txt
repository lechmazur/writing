<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to translate generations via sounds drives concrete micro-choices like jar arrangement and pouring, with embodied emotion in tears at mother's lullaby. Interiority particular through iterative poems revealing poetic voice under pressure. Final purpose earned via prior causality without safety-hedging; no strong contradictory impulses in scene limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: sounds density builds from single creak to medley, tightening to village impact and closure RR (Charged Poise in humming box as purpose found). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elias, loft, dawn). One transition (to village) legible; cost legible in "weight lift" amid vagrant life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt, old wood, gold light) selective via Elias's poetic bias, guiding jar ritual in loft. Dunes/loft constrain ceremony and return for closure image. Body/music box as micro-setting charges final hum; no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sweeten silence via box) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: first jar unlocks lullaby (deepening knowledge), building to village faces softening. Agency in capturing/pouring; cost in weeks spent, felt in purpose crystallization. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of bridging past/present emerges via jars unlocking voices, resonating in old woman's recognition without statement. Final image (box humming as bridge) non-literal answer reweighting vagrancy. Poem iterations organically tie without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature (wistful gold, jarred thread). Voice modulates rhythm in poems; minimal dialogue natural ("In the silence"). No head-hopping; diction fits vagrant poet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Blatant artifact "(Oops—too long. Let’s trim.)" and poem iterations create scaffold loops/paraphrase churn in reflective beat, dulling momentum (−1.5). Minor template cadence in sound lists; rhythm varies elsewhere but overwriting in descriptions (e.g., "feral loft beneath the dunes" repeats). Density high outside artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh magical realism of sound-jars reviving memories transforms vagrant poet trope organically. Core premise (box plays captured echoes) inevitable via particulars; no close famous echoes.</comment>
