<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to reclaim memories compels concrete micro-choices like coffee reading and tunnel entry, embodied in wildflower talisman; internal conflict via fear vs. drive peaks credibly at rose touch. Backstory anchors to present via flowers without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with coffee pattern density tightening to tunnel/rose CR; orientation anchored early in chamber/whale context; cost legible in fear reconfiguration to guiding duty at "new purpose now."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt crystals constrain panel discovery and evolve to line final chamber hum; gravity fluctuations tactilely guide choices; whale rot filters POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Memory recovery stake signaled early, deepens accumulatively via gravity flares narrowing to rose; agency in pattern-tracing forces trade-off with physical stumble cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Preservation-over-loss theme emerges implicitly from rose/memories flood repricing gravity pockets; flowers-rose linkage offers non-literal answer to memory void without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual bias toward patterns/shadows; rhythmic prose modulates from flickering unease to humming stability; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels via crunching/heavy air tactility; purposeful gravity/salt repetition avoids loops; minor density dip in early chamber scan but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coffee divination and salt-stored memories synthesize fresh fantasy logic; rose as living key transforms loss trope inevitably from wildflower seed.</comment>
