<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's receptivity to the unexplained drives consistent micro-choices like planting the seed despite unknowns, earning his final epiphany; interiority feels particular through calloused hands and curiosity labyrinth. Limited contradictory impulses—panic is brief and resolved smoothly—prevent elite band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations (envelope, spectrometer, growth) densify mystery toward CR closure: key discovery reconfigures seed as puzzle gift with conceptual cost of shifted worldview. One tightening via plant's disappearance narrows to trail; orientation anchored early ("nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brook mud and workshop tools constrain choices—seed planted in brook soil, trail followed there yielding key—charging final image of haven as "crucible." Sensory selectivity (ink-black water, pulsing seed) reflects Elias's priorities without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher seed) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven deepening (planting, tracking slime) under Accumulative lens, culminating in trade-off: mystery yields inspiration but plant escapes. Felt cost legible in empty pot panic and laughter's sharpness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of answers emerging via non-forceful flow arises organically from seed-to-key arc, resonant in final "world shifted" without moralizing. Returning spiral motif reweights premise subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (seed as "question posed"); rhythmic control modulates from brooding to sharp laughter. Stable third-limited POV with purposeful lyric compression pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stem ribbed like a brain" advances growth and theme); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor motif repetition ("storm-born silence") purposeful, not looping; no filter stacks or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Corpse flower seed-to-iron key synthesis transforms mystery trope into innovator's crucible, inevitable in hindsight via orthogonal sleuthing. Bold risk in plant's agency heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
