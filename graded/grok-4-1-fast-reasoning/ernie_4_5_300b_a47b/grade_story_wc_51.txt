<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in trembling hands at obsidian and hesitation at mother's locket compel earned renunciation with visible personal cost. Interiority particular via mother's recalled voice tilting present choices. No safety-hedging; flaw of avoidance drives closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sequential burdens to obsidian crack as tightening, yielding Charged Poise CR at locket pause where cost of leaving it buried reconfigures premise. Orientation anchored early in grotto/pool/lamp. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in "some burdens...meant to stay buried."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Starlight fissure constrains lamp orientation, charging pivotal obsidian beat and echoed in workshop window for final image. Sensory hierarchy (wet metal, humming walls) reflects Kael's priorities; micro-setting (niches, pool) tactile and lived-in. Evolving details (thinner hush) mirror process without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect weights properly) signaled early; textural deepening via thorn cooperation to obsidian resistance narrows options, forcing reorientation agency with embodied cost (sweat, heart-break crack). Coherent pressure to closure endurance. Single tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of weights-not-wounds emerges organically from weaving acts; final storage/dream reconfigures via fractal shifts and hummed tune, offering non-literal answer with lingering ambiguity on personal hush. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like sharp star fractal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fractal-like diction ("shingled hush," "liquid memory") biases noticing toward patterns/weights; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure at obsidian ("crack split the stone"). Stable close-third POV; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance process + embody stress). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful figures (grotto as beast) cohere without muddle in peak obsidian beat. Zero scaffold; clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual fantasy via fractal-weaving burdens transforms tropes; world logic (hush calcification) commits fully, with risk in personal anchor refusal heightening stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early premise to charged closure.</comment>
