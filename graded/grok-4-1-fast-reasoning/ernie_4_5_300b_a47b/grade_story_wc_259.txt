<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to avoid patterns and pursue truth drives micro-choices like tracing carvings and touching the pagoda, earning her final embrace with embodied tremor and hitched breath. Internal conflict surfaces simultaneously in steady voice vs. trembling hands during Kael's challenge. Kael applies relevant pressure, distinguishing voices; minor epiphanic phrasing ("truth... worth fighting for") slips but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whispers to hum/glow, tightening to Charged Poise/CR in "end of innocence... behind her" with Kael's departure as felt relational cost. Single scene anchored early (Lirael at pagoda in archive). One meaningful deepening via pagoda's activation reconfigures past as choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze pagoda as micro-setting constrains choices (tracing, palm placement) and charges final image via glowing carvings/light pool. Sensory details (swirling motes, humming vibration) filtered through Lirael's priorities, mirroring internal nostalgia. Spatial choreography clear; twilight beam pierces to evolve atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purify chaos vs. corruption) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Kael confrontation and pagoda pulse narrowing to embrace/renunciation. Agency in palm placement forecloses clinging path; cost legible in Kael's recoil/departure and "steady unpredictability."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth as messy choice emerges from particulars (shifting carvings, liquid gold light), reweighting past-as-warning to past-as-seed without statement. Final image ("walked deeper... open arms") offers non-literal resonance, charging "atoms of nostalgia" reprise. No moralizing; ambiguity in "choice" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (nostalgic particles, living bronze); diction/rhythm poetic yet biased to Lirael's historian lens. Dialogue subtextual ("Corruption is just another pattern"), goal-driven, distinct (Kael's brittle laugh vs. her murmur). No head-hopping; compression purposeful in glow beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "carvings shifted subtly, as if alive"); rhythm varies, propulsion builds to hum's "painful" peak. Figurative language dense but coherent/patterned (motess as nostalgia), pays off in closure image. Minor repetition ("light") but no loops/artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic archaeology (archive as seed, patterns avoided for purity) transforms forbidden knowledge trope via specific veil/pagoda logic. Risky lyrical voice heightens stakes without gimmick; final reconfiguration ("questions... possibility") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
