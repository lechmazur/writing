<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Post-fever contradictions between oracle logic and embodied feeling ("tasted the metallic tang") compel folder discovery and descent, earning final renunciation with relational cost (defying director).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as smudging and discoveries densify toward CR closure; folder find ("QUARANTINE" contents) tightens causality to descent with legible isolation cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Illustration as micro-setting constrains choices (traced, smudged, tucked) and charges final herbalist image, filtering sensory details through oracle's frayed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of station lie tightens via folder agency, forcing survival trade-off; descent forecloses duty path under accumulative lens with felt director-rage cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Herbalist reprise ("grows where... cracks") offers non-literal answer to certainty-swaying question, reweighting bearberry motif organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature on "frayed" margins and cracks sustains close third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation heightens internal pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Purposeful "smudge" motif varies rhythm without loops; high density integrates sensory propulsion, minor reflection anchors avoid scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oracle-bearberry synthesis transforms certainty trope via margins/roots; risk of lyric CR heightens stakes through irreplaceable fault-tolerance angle.</comment>
