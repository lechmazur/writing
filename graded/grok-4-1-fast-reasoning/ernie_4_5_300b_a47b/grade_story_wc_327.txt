<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the realization of her fear as oblivion, compelling the hurling of the diamond with embodied cost (searing palm); interiority concrete via vein-tracing and hum-weaving; final renunciation earned by lifelong dedication under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bird patterns to diamond pulse to echo roar, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure when "She hurled the diamond into the abyss" reconfigures curse as mirror with legible cost (burn, lingering song).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and canyon echoes constrain ledge-cling and hum-test, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (echo-distorted cries, wind-tug) filters through storyteller's priorities, evolving causally to vibrating runes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness diamond resonance) signaled early, tightens via bird-freeze reversal under Accumulative lens; agency in hum and hurl forecloses path with on-page burn-price, crystallizing stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of felt-vs-spoken languages emerges organically via texture-to-sound pursuit, resonant in final "some languages are meant to be felt" reweighting without moralizing; diamond mirror-image answers fear-of-oblivion question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sonic-textural bias (e.g., "chirps into chords"); rhythmic modulation heightens climax hum; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring vibrations; minor figurative density in opening (molten ore, skeletal fingers) purposeful under textural lens but borders coherence slip pre-climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic linguistics and curse-mirror in fractal bird/diamond climax transforms extinction trope; risk-taking in lyric resonance inevitable from patterns motif.</comment>
