<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Mara's solitary vigilance versus shared remembering act simultaneously, culminating in her earned choice to place her own photo with visible cost to prior isolation. Interiority concrete via embodied tension ("chest tightened") and micro-choices under pressure. Flawless distinction in voices during pivotal woman encounter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via label → photos → woman → realization, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure when Mara adds her photo, reweighting vigilance with undeniable relational cost in the final image. Orientation anchored early at reservoir edge. No causality breaks; persistent constraint of receding waterline shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring reservoir and mossy foundations constrain choices (exposes churchyard, enables photo trail) and charge final image of resurfacing town in stories. Sensory hierarchy via Mara's professional gaze (scanning cracks) narrows to tactile relics. Atmosphere's "mirrored hush" evolves purposefully with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dam vigilance versus resurfacing memories tightens via Accumulative deepening: label discovery → photo ritual → woman's arrival forces stance crystallization in photo placement, foreclosing hoarding with felt exposure cost. Agency in following ridgeway and final act drives escalation. Cost unmistakable in shift from "expunging ghosts" to shared trail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stories preserving submerged town emerges organically from particulars, answered non-literally in trail of photos "lighting the way" as Charged Poise reconfiguration. Subtext in woman's rasp and Elias's eyes layers ambiguity without moralizing. Final image reweights hoarding as precisely humane failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (leveewarden bias toward water/survival) and rhythmic modulation under stress; dialogue subtextual ("You’ve always been vigilant. Now you need to be something else") pursues goals. Distinct idioms: Mara's edged authority vs. woman's rasp. No head-hopping; elisions taught early via chime silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "boots crunching gravel" advances scan). Varied rhythm avoids templates; minor repetition of "tightened" spaced and embodied. Zero loops or artifacts dulling closure image of photo trail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ghost-town trope via liqueur label as map to memory-sharing, with risk-taking lyric trail of photos heightening stakes organically. No derivative echoes; ridgeway photos inevitable from vigilant hoarding premise. Bold conceptual risk in CR closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
