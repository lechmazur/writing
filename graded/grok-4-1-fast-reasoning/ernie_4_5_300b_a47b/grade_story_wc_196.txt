<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's embodied reactions to the button—heart stuttering, breath catching—reveal character-specific ache and hope; final folder act earns renunciation of pure neglect with emotional cost rooted in his backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering discoveries (grime pattern, button, date) to Conceptual Repricing closure in folder labeling; cost legible in "heart full" against persistent unwanted ache, oriented early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust patterns and button as micro-settings constrain discoveries and charge final image; sensory selectivity (mildew, creak) mirrors archival urgency through Elias's biased gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring unknowns deepens via button/date escalation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to documentation choice; agency in tracing/imagining forecloses neglect with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of magnified kindnesses emerges via button's reweighted history, final writing image resonating as non-literal answer without moralizing; particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with archival perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation builds texture in reflective beats, diction biased toward neglect's "language."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion in dust/button beats, but minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("bowing shelves like silent tombs") risks purple drift; no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emancipation button in foster files transforms relic trope via dust-method archival ingenuity; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes organically.</comment>
