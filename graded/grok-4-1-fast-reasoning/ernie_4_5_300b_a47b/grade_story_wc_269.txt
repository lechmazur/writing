<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira's tapping embodies motivation and internal conflict, intensifying to compel the journey choice with felt cost in descent into storm. Kael's shift from dismissal to alliance applies pressure but lacks deeper contradiction. Final tapping as "drumbeat of defiance" and "song" reveals hierarchy of values earned by prior obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clues (atlas, dream, plankton) build density to CR closure in "paths reappeared behind them, etched in light," with station-empty cost legible. Orientation anchored early in station/atoll. Storm revelation tightens without breaks; shards legible under mosaic track.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent plankton "spelling out coordinates" constrains choice to follow path, charging final glowing corals image. Sensory hierarchy (tapping echoes, cool metal, churning ocean) reflects Lira's urgency. Setting evolves causally from lab to storm, mirroring grief to resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths disappear) signaled early, deepens via plankton to force journey agency under accumulative lens. One tightening forecloses dismissal option; cost in abandoning station visible. Kael's hesitation crystallizes shared stance with trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of ban as "beginning, not an end" emerges organically from particulars (flickering islands, used gateways), reweighted in final "new world, one tap at a time" without moralizing. Tapping motif accumulates resonance, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with Lira's perceptual signature in rhythmic noticing (tapping as "language only she understood"). Voice modulates poetically under stress, prose syntax echoing taps. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("What is this?"/"It’s the path").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (plankton light "spelling out coordinates"); rhythm varies with scene urgency, no loops dulling closure. Minor repetition of "assembling" purposeful under textural lens. No artifacts in peak storm beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-ban awakens cyclic gateways, tapping as resistance transforms eco-tropes via "periodically eternal" logic. Risky mosaic pays off in inevitable CR; no derivative hedging.</comment>
