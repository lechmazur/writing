<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in tracing wood and tentative first cut; contradictory impulses from months of avoidance to yielding knife create earned endurance. Final realization ("carry the dead forward without being buried") feels character-particular, tied to lion tamer traits. Minor therapy-speak in epiphany ("not closure, but understanding") dings without deeper cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via carving shavings piling as "discarded seconds," tightening density to Charged Poise closure in lion placement on windowsill. Orientation anchored instantly in loft and Clara's widowhood. Cost legible in "carry the dead forward without being buried by them," reconfiguring grief's void with emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain-streaked skylight and rust-hued loft constrain isolation, mirroring internal decay while charging final image: fractured light on lion creates "tiny stars." Sensory details (damp wool, whetstone scrape) selectively filter through Clara's grief-biased perception. No white-room; loft as timeless bubble guides carving choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (process grief via carving) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from tentative groove to serene lion form, narrowing from raw avoidance to transformative stance. Agency in knife yields forcing trade-off: sweat and cold kettle as felt costs alter focus. One deepening sufficient; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-transformation emerges organically from ash lion containing "here and gone"; final image reweights premise without literal moral. Subtext in honey-sweetened tea evokes husband subtly. Slight directness in "This is how we survive" borders thematic echo, but ambiguity lingers in imperfect carving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature: grief warps time/weather into "mosaic" and "watercolor haze." Lyrical rhythm modulates from steady whetstone scrape to humming quiet post-carving. No dialogue; diction controlled, biased toward tactile wood/sawdust over abstract.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wood resisted at first, then yielded" advances action/emotion); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("silver threads," "watercolor haze") purposeful for tone, no muddle. Slight paraphrase loop in "kettle boils" motif, but spaced and motif-charging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lion tamer widow carves grief into husband's gifted wood amid boiling kettle frame transforms widow trope via "crystallized time." No template echoes; carving as chaos-container risks bold alchemy payoff in serene lion. Transformation test passes—swap elements breaks closure image.</comment>
