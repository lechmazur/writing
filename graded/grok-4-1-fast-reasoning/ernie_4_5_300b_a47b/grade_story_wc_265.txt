<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied sixth sense and motivation tied to father's gear compel choices effectively; minor slip in minimal shown contradiction at gear release, but endurance earned with pocket's emptiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR: gear vanishes as seed, reconfiguring forest as brain with conceptual cost of coexistence; orientation anchored early, one tightening at circle clearing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Specific ironwood/copperwillow hums constrain unraveling choice and charge final mossy transformation; sensory evolution mirrors revelation without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode hum tightens accumulatively via sixth-sense flare and gear insert; agency in sound-guided unraveling forecloses retention with legible loss at seed departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coexistence theme emerges organically from brain revelation and gear-seed planting; final "pocket empty but mind full" reweights machinery-nature fusion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with sensory-perceptual signature (hums as insight) and rhythmic modulation; father's synthesized voice distinct and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete images; no loops, scaffolds, or muddle even in revelation beat ("trees pulsed with bioluminescent light").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Forest-as-brain and gear-seed synthesize steampunk-mystical elements into inevitable CR; risk-taking in sonic decoding heightens stakes organically.</comment>
