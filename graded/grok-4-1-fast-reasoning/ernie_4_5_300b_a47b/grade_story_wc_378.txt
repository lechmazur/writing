<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—ignoring glitch vs. acting on leak—act in scene, culminating in earned absorption of orb with visible cost of lingering static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of leak-memory-burn tightens to RR closure ("static wasn’t entirely gone—but fragmented wholeness") with constraint of magnetic storm shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dome's warping field constrains box seals and forces burn choice; roses mirror internal chaos in final bloom image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static) deepens via burn agency under accumulative lens, foreclosing overwhelm with cost of imperfect integration legible in "static... like a song."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonant non-literal answer in realization ("not to eradicate the static, but to live with it") reweights chaos premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct android-organic perceptual signature ("hum... strangely organic") with rhythmic control; stable limited POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful figures (e.g., "flame licked... shattering glass"); zero loops, clean propulsion through peak burn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI fears-box and magnetic-burn transforms sentience trope; risk of lyric sci-fi integration inevitable in wholeness image.</comment>
