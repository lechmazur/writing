<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Face-blind trait roots motivation in textures/hues, driving discovery and painting with embodied curiosity vs. caution; final safe-grab earns change overcoming her limits. Internal conflict acts in scene via hovering brush and bold strokes. Minor limit: no relationships as crucible with absent on-page others.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coin-panel-safe-journal deepens pattern density toward CR closure in portrait/escape with tree-fall cost legible ("The first blow... shook the trunk"). Single scene oriented early (forehead vs. bark), causal linkages narrow options to preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tree hollow constrains choices (embedded panel, dust from blows) and charges final image (groaning trunk, portrait left); sensory selection (damp bark, wet soil) filters via artist's bias. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve legacy pre-demolition) signaled early, tightens via journal revelation forcing paint-shift; agency in safe-lift/escape forecloses tree's fall with felt cost. Escalation coheres accumulatively: rumbles culminate in blow shaking priorities.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of limits overcome emerges from particulars (fractals, sky blueprints) to resonant CR: "a legacy etched in light and wood" reweights premise without statement. Subtext in journal reprise invites ambiguity on preservation's defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (grain spirals as constellations); rhythmic diction modulates from stillness to chaos ("Dust rained down"). No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accum lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short punchy blows amid lush texture); no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density in spirals but pattern-taught/payoff-charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms hidden-knowledge trope via fractal artist in living calendar tree; non-obvious synthesis (face-blindness enables sky-mirroring) inevitable in hindsight, risks bold CR closure.</comment>
