<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to translate silence into music drives micro-choices like deliberate signing, embodied in graceful hands and rare smile; Lira's skepticism-to-intrigue arc applies pressure via violin. Crowd as secondary feels generic without distinct pressure. Final endurance of fading joy earns stasis with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo signing to duo to crowd music, tightening via pattern of silence-to-sound. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (Kael at moonlit harbor). Closure as Charged Poise in dawn image ("camera cold against his chest") reconfigures silence from prison to spoken canvas with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor vividly selective (lapping waves, rope creaks, mist blending silhouette); recurring camera-as-tool constrains signing action and charges final cold touch against chest. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's silence-focus, mirroring internal loneliness without overt symbolism. Bodies choreograph cleanly on docks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate/disrupt silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as Lira joins then crowd gathers, narrowing to collective mapping with deepening cadence. Agency in signing forces Lira's playing; cost legible in music's swell then fade ("joy would fade, like all things").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-canvas emerges organically from signing-to-music arc, subtext in filmless camera and prison thought; joyful sorrow tone reweights via violin "weeping and laughing." Final image offers resonant CR (silence spoken but transient) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Kael with perceptual bias toward silence-shapes; lyrical diction ("liquid silver," fluid signs) modulates rhythmically with intensity. Signed dialogue natural/subtextual ("Listening"); no head-hopping despite crowd.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short wave responses, long swells); high density integrates sensory/motion without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("symphony of stillness") in opener purposeful for tone, not overwriting; propulsion peaks in signing blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Filmless camera-signing-to-music premise ingeniously transforms silence trope into tactile disruption; risk in surreal wave-response pays off in crowd resonance without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
