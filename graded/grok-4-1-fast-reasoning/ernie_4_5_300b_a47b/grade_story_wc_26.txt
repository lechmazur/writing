<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in deliberate trait, shown in pause before alerting council and hesitation at "Bloom"; embodied emotions via tightening grip and wet eyes earn change. Thalos applies pressure effectively as foil. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "mind raced" but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shadow sighting → footage comparison → superimposition → word utterance as DC with fragility cost legible in "one wrong move, and it’ll shatter." Orientation anchored early via library/dusk. Single scene coherent; closure reconfiguration reweights hope with on-page transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blooming library's petrified petals and glass dome constrain via archives/pedestal evolution, charging final books-shuddering image; sensory hum/glow selective through Lirael's priorities. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-object (console/stone alignment) guides choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope's shape) signaled early, tightens via footage superimposition narrowing to word; agency in utterance forecloses shatter-risk with felt cost. Causal escalation coheres; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hope's metamorphosis emerges organically via shadow/stones/footage particulars, resonant in final motes scattering to reorder books without moralizing. Subtext in Thalos's "luminous regret" implies complexity; invites reflection on change's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (sharp eyes on symbols/dusk); dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (Thalos reveals stakes, prompts action). Prose rhythm modulates tension, distinct voices in "softly deliberate" idiom vs. luminous speech. Clean free indirect style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to climax; no loops/artifacts dull closure (e.g., stone warmth → twist sharpens). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("robes woven from spider silk and starlight") but consistent/voice-motivated, not obscuring peak "Bloom" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams/library-as-hope-preserver transforms shadow trope via time-sharing footage; risk in fragile resolution heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; particular details (1987 clip posture match) feel inevitable.</comment>
