<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as truth-seeker intensifies credibly through discoveries, with embodied reactions like pulse quickening; Tomas applies precise pressure as foil. Minor tidy progression in realizations slightly undercuts contradictory impulses, but final choice to recast history feels earned with cost of eroded trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via symbol discoveries tightening to CR closure: inscription "Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed." reweights noble lies with conceptual cost of required courage, legible in final image of ivy steps and smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy and thorns vividly constrain choices (vines part to reveal door) and charge closure (ivy-choked steps mirror growth potential); sensory details like damp earth integrate purposefully through Elara's historian filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to recapture truth signaled early, escalates accumulatively via symbol/map realizations narrowing to fragile truce knowledge; agency in prying T forecloses heroic narrative with felt cost of delayed war.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from motif shifts (rose/key/chain as dialogue), resonant CR ending reweights without moralizing: "lies... erode unless balanced by courage."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with historian's perceptual signature (noticing serifs, timelines); Tomas's dialogue distinct in rational subtext vs. Elara's intrigue, advancing plot cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but minor paraphrase loops around "noble lie" (three uses in tunnel/chamber) slightly dull peak realizations without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of illuminated letters as anchors/maps transforming historian trope into parallel-drawing quest; risk in riddle/Tomas payoff heightens stakes organically.</comment>
