<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (ache in bones, nose tingle) and contradictory impulses (logic vs. mysticism) compel the coin drop; change earned as acceptance forecloses prior balance obsession. Minor diagnostic label-speak in Lira's "balance isn’t about equal parts" softens peak authenticity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (glow, vortex) builds to CR closure where Lira's fade reconfigures names/balance with felt cost in Kael's empty grasp ("hand closed on empty air"). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry's molten pit constrains pivotal drop and charges final dimming image; sensory hierarchy (rain drum, iron/wet earth) reflects alchemical urgency, evolving causally (vortex swirls metal).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand sister's fate/redeem) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via coin ritual to renunciation of tidy balance; cost legible in her freedom vs. his loss, charging fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending cracks emerges organically via coin drop and kintsugi bowl recall; final image (extinguished glow) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior logic-magic tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors like "ink into water"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing voices naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion in vortex beat; minor paraphrase loop ("names hold weight"/"names have weight"/"name too heavy") dulls one reflective beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy ritual and kintsugi for ghost communion transforms loss trope; coin's zodiac glow offers non-obvious ingenuity driving closure.</comment>
