<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's solemn archivist traits drive consistent motivation from decryption to descent, with embodied fraying ("cheeks streaked with tears") and contradictory fear/death vision vs. truth pursuit in tunnel choice. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in lagoon parley beat. Minor slip in stock frown repetition early, but closure endurance earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: diary visions therefore parley therefore descent to DC closure (trapdoor collapse swallowing codex/antagonist). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (zeppelin/dunes/Mara/diary). Structure as taught shards (zeppelin-dunes-tunnels) with legible transitions; cost legible in "pages now blank... bought time."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains choices (debris messages part water for stairs) and charges final image (calm once more). Sensory vivid/selective (salt/decay scent, cold tunnels, bioluminescent glow); POV-filtered (symbols noticed by archivist). Choreography coherent through descent/emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. erasure/self-loss) signaled early, tightens causally via death vision narrowing to parley/descent agency. Antagonist reveal forces trade-off; cost visible in collapse ("swallowing him and the codex") altering tactics to "bought time." Escalation coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of history's fragility vs. erasure emerges organically from diary/ghost/codex destruction, resonant in blank pages final image reweighting truth's impermanence without moral. Subtext in Elara's "erase the past to justify their present." Complexity in ambiguous victory lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ink-stained focus on symbols/letters). Dialogue natural/subtextual (Joran's scoff warns, Elara reveals stakes). Rhythm modulates tension; no head-hopping, diction POV-apt (archival precision).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Density high, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax in peak tunnel beat. Minor paraphrase loop ("frowned" twice early, -0.2); no closure artifacts. Figuratives purposeful (pulsing symbols) without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognition + debris-parley ghosts + dune-tunnels transforms spy thriller into reverie quest. Risky fantasy logic (lagoon stairs, human-skin codex) heightens stakes organically; no template echoes.</comment>
