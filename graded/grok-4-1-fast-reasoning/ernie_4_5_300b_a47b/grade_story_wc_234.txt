<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies compellingly through past failures and Jorin's ledger, earning her shift with embodied persistence; Jorin applies precise pressure as mirror without overshadowing. Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing ("palette of resolve wasn’t a tool—it was a philosophy") borders unearned but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: engine harmony reconfigures failures into success, cost legible in "transformed failure into a kind of alchemy itself." Orientation anchors instantly in nexus forge; single scene tightens meaningfully via ledger insight without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nexus embers and columella shell constrain choices (fading light stakes engine alignment) and charge final flare image. Sensory details (crunching lava shards, humming crickets) integrate purposefully through Elara's priorities, evolving causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize nexus via shell resonance) signaled early, deepens via ledger to foreclose force-fit tactic with past explosion costs felt. Agency in leaning into uncertainty tightens under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of revaluing failure emerges organically from particulars (shell, ledger, engine whir), final image resonating non-literally. Minor friction: "density of presence" realization articulates thesis closely without full subtext indirection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (light as language) biased to Elara's alchemy; dialogue natural/subtextual (Jorin's doubts pursue goal). Rhythmic control modulates tension, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (nebula spectrum) without muddle in peak whir. Minor figurative density in opening but no loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logarithmic shell resonance and "palette of resolve" philosophy transforms alchemy trope organically. Risky conceptual CR (failure as alchemy) heightens stakes inevitably from particulars.</comment>
