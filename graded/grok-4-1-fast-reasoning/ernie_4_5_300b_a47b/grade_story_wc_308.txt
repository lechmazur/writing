<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in decades of failure and training compels the realization; interiority embodied via warming arrowhead and pulsing river. Minor backstory summary early dilutes peak pressure but anchors present appraisal without flattening drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from bird patterns to meditation confirmation; CR closure lands in "Kael understood" beat with conceptual cost of prior chasing foreclosed. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single extended scene fits defaults with one tightening via figure-eight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain appraisal from spire and urge listening via voices, charging final descent image. Sensory hum and bruised sky selectively mirror alignment theme without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to master navigation-without-moving signaled early, deepens via birds' cycle pattern forcing alignment realization. Escalation accumulates texturally to foreclose chasing path with felt cost of generational failure in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of harmony over pursuit emerges organically from bird V/spiral/figure-eight to final "navigate without moving" as listening/trust. Resonant CR in descent reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual bias to patterns and pulses; rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to poised closure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition of figure-eight and pulse tying beats; minor paraphrase in eye-closing beats but no closure harm. Varied rhythm propels to final image without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pulse wandering, bird augury, and bone-echo canyon transforms navigation paradox into alignment CR. Risky lyric build inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes.</comment>
