<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies convincingly from numbness to raw emotion, earned by harmonizing opposites against clone's mimicry; internal conflict embodied in "wave of calm" countering brute force. Clone applies pressure as mirror but lacks distinct voice beyond sneers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal linkages build tightly: palm slam provokes mimicry, leading to will-driven merge in brain jar as DC with legible emotional cost in "emotions raw but real." Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 1; lens holds causal through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Floating dojo's jagged edges and shuddering platform constrain choices, charging climax as stones rain; vortex sky evolves causally, mirroring internal chaos to stabilize at end. Sensory wind/colors integrate via action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (existence/soul vs numbness) tightens via clone's rebellion and energy collision, forcing Kael's renunciation of fear-self; agency in final surge forecloses clone's autonomy with raw emotion cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of self as choice over duplication emerges via brain jar's shift from "duplicate" to catalyst; resonant non-literal answer in "You're a choice" reweights opposites motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (e.g., "slicing through pretense"); dialogue distinct—clone's oily taunts vs Kael's feral grin—advances goals with subtext. Rhythm modulates under stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor metaphor churn ("wildfire," "volcano") in peak beats slightly muddles propulsion; no loops, clean syntax propels to explosion image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clone battle with opposites harmony and history-rewriting dojo transforms tropes; brain jar's custody pivot feels inevitable from early setup, risking bold merge payoff.</comment>
