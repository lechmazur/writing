<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clara's contradictory impulses (grip pull vs. drop it) act in final beat, earning closure from past dead-exchange regret; embodied via tightened fingers and traced scrollwork. Elias pressures via jaw-tighten reveal. Voice distinct in grunts vs. thoughtful redefinitions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: image density (mist, pull, moon) tightens to RR closure in drop ("some mistakes...let go") with legible cost of release. Single-shard coherence; orientation anchored in parapet opener.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parapet/mist constrain descent and charge final drop ("vanished instantly, swallowed"); sensory urgent (ozone shift, rain hit). POV filters via negotiator priorities (tide groans as lies).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (trust edge in exchange) deepens accumulatively via family details ("invisible ink"), forcing humanization; cost in pull drop forecloses carry-option. Smooth exchange tests but doesn't resolve via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drop reweights mistake premise (handle → release) non-literally, emerging from particulars without statement; Elias's pull adds ambiguity. No moralizing in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature ("untether...rhythm of regret"); dialogue subtextual ("Curiosity isn’t a crime") advances goal. Rhythm modulates to charged poise at storm break.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density (pull traces action/thought/theme); varied rhythm, no loops, though opener metaphors dense without obscuring closure drop. Propulsion clear in descent beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drawer pull transforms exchange trope into mistake talisman with fresh moon-sync twist; risk in quiet CR closure (Elias's pull) heightens inevitability.</comment>
