<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clara's shrewd traits root motivation in calculating mind clashing with "ache of unspoken things," intensifying to forge letter despite moral cost; contradictory impulses peak in "truth mattered less than the act," earning final change with desk photo as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via envelope-locket-postcard pattern tightening knowledge of missed compassion; CR closure lands cleanly in postcard "I notice now too" reconfiguring cycles with conceptual cost of initiated chain; mosaic shards legible, pattern taught early in looping mind.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library fan's "whispers of old stories" and harbor "salt-tinged air" filter through maritime POV, constraining drift to envelope; locket charges final desk image, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unnoticed ache tightens accumulatively via boardinghouse realization narrowing to forge/initiate; agency in "pressing the envelope" forecloses absorbed path with felt forgery cost legible in smile amid moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cycles emerge organically from envelope redirect to postcard reprise, final "Profit, Unseen" offering resonant CR without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in forgery's ethics, reweighting premise via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward numbers/seas ("freight rates," "silent crew"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I have something for you"), rhythm modulates from restless to poised end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("heels crunching gravel," "fan still turned"); no loops/artifacts, figurative restraint in peaks preserves clarity to charged "cycle turned anew."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mistaken self-handwriting envelope transforms lost-girl trope into compassion cycle via broker's invisible-cost lens; mosaic risk heightens stakes without obscuring CR closure.</comment>
