<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied persistence shines in mending with wire and starlight, earning closure endurance; ribbon as wrist talisman reveals contradictory stubbornness and love without therapy-speak. Daughter's absence limits relational crucible, but solo micro-choices under breach pressure compel higher stakes credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from climb to mending DC, orchard bloom as RR with persistence cost legible in "trees that had been dormant suddenly burst into bloom." Orientation anchors early; single scene fits defaults, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rafter orchard constrains climb and moss-nest choice, charging final glowing eye image; sensory crunch of fruit, petal rain mirror internal mend. POV-filtered details (gnarled branches, wind-whispers) evolve causally with bloom, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant persistence stake signaled early, tightens via quartz seal forcing orchard reconfiguration; agency in mending forecloses abandonment path with felt staying-cost. One decisive deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accidental wisdom emerges organically from scraps-mend to thriving orchard, ribbon slip reweighting breach as gain without moralizing. Final pocket-tuck offers non-literal resonance on generational bridge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with Lira's mender-signature (gears, wire-glow) modulates rhythm in mend-stress; purposeful poetic compression legible, no head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels mending ("wire glowed orange...sealing it with a drop"); minor persistence-paraphrase near end avoids loop cap, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quartz-eye in rafter orchard post-breach transforms mend-persistence trope via starlight scraps; fresh synthesis inevitable in bloom payoff, bold lush risk heightens quiet closure.</comment>
