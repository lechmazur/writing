<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's resourcefulness compels high-stakes choices like stealing the key and using the puddle map, rooted in father's legacy and slum origins; Jax applies secondary pressure via timing warnings. Interiority embodied in jaw tightening and racing mind under drone threat. Minor stock phrasing like "heart pounded" slightly dilutes peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: infiltration → puddle map → tunnel → terminal success → alarms → escape with drive. Orientation anchored early in lagoon with drones/tyrant. Closure as Charged Poise in final key grasp and smile after explosion, with legible cost in lost station and risked life; one tightening via copy alarms narrows escape options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Auric lagoon's gold water and bioluminescent tunnel constrain choices (submerged path numbs skin, forces dive); sensory hierarchy narrows to lights and alarms in crisis. Final silver shift mirrors success. Setting evolves causally with explosion sparks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose erasures) tightens via alarms during copy, forcing dive trade-off; agency in improvised tunnel and grab drive. Cost legible in station explosion after escape. Pressure coheres causally to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of resisting erasure/indifference emerges via key symbol, revised files, and final line hold; resonant image reweights legacy without statement. Subtext in Jax grin and Mara shrug implies relational crucible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (constellations, puddles); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Carefully resourceful") advances stakes, distinct voices. Rhythm modulates with short crisis sentences; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (gold numbing, algae glow); varied rhythm accelerates in alarms/dive. Minor figurative density ("steel vultures," "gaping mouth") purposeful without muddle. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Puddle-map method and phone-key history transform rebel trope via defunct rebellion nodes; fresh synthesis in water secrets and relic symbol charges closure. Bold risk in submerged improv pays off.</comment>
