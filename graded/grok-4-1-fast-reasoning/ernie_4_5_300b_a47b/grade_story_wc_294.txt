<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias's polished calm and legacy conflict motivate subtle dissuasion effectively, with micro-choices like bill placement revealing values. Internal endurance earns peace, but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous action in key reflection beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density to on-page CR closure ("money...now felt like a talisman"), with tightening from observation of fraying trust; action summaries slightly blur causality without harming end cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid train details (rusting carriages, ivy, poster) mirror cycles and constrain reflective choices, charging final image; selective sensory hierarchy fits calm POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissuade via subtlety, probe cycles) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through markers' observed fraying to CR reconfiguration; agency in non-violent placement forecloses force path with emotional cost felt in peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of choice-driven cycles emerges organically from bills/train/poster, reweighted in talisman CR without statement; lingering ambiguity in "broken cycle" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of ahead-minded calm; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image; varied rhythm propels to closure, but minor "calm" repetition and dusky phrasing paraphrase slightly dull one reflective beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh symbolic currency markers transform robber legacy into subtle dissuasion; cycle motif risks trope but specificity via global bills innovates payoff.</comment>
