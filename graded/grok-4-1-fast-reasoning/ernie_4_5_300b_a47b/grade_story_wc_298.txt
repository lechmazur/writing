<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in Lirael's certainty vs. regret, embodied in hesitation before sewing the bone; micro-choices like pressing the card into the keeper's hand reveal values under pressure. Final change to "fiercely gentle wisdom" earned via ritual causality. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing during vision ("lesson" reframing feels slightly tidy) caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to ritual, tightening via sewing to CR closure in fruit vision that reweights past with conceptual cost of reframed recklessness. Orientation anchored early in orchard description; one meaningful deepening suffices. Cost legible in "holes... now shimmered with newfound resilience."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (stepping over bones) and charges final image (roots parting for exit). Sensory details like "pulsing fruit" and "bioluminescent fungi" filtered through Lirael's dusky resolve, mirroring internal shift. Vivid, purposeful integration elevates; body/tool (needle/bone) as micro-setting qualifies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patching soul) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through barter to sewing and vision, narrowing to renunciation of certainty. Agency in stitching forecloses reckless path with felt cost in bittersweet juice. One tightening decisive; minor abstractness in stakes pre-ritual holds from 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regret-as-growth emerges organically from ritual particulars, resonating in final image where "roots seemed to part," reweighting Fool card without moralizing. Subtext in keeper's cryptic lines; ambiguity lingers in ongoing recklessness-with-wisdom. Non-literal answer to certainty's cost ties arc cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (tarot relic, bone hum via touch); voice rhythmic, modulating from whisper to strong clarity post-vision. Dialogue subtextual ("Trammel your regret") advances goals. Minor filter-verb density in descriptions but voice-motivated for lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roots coiling like serpents" advances setting/conflict); rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in vision cascade. Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("souls trapped between worlds") purposeful under accumulative lens but touches high-pressure ritual slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot/soul-barter in bone-orchard ritual transforms fantasy tropes via specific stitching mechanics. Risky lyric imagery (pulsing fruit vision) heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from Fool card to ash-growth. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
