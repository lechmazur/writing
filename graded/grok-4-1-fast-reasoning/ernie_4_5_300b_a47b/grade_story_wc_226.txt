<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in artist's defiance drives choices to climax; interiority concrete in belief that spire is "lens" to refract truth. Contradictory impulses visible in knowing "price of forgiveness was high" yet painting anyway, earning final endurance as heretic. Minor slip: old woman's brief pressure underuses status dynamics for deeper crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: painting "Forgive" and reciting cause canyon shudder, spire shimmer, light burst as Conceptual Repricing with cost in "elders would call him a heretic." Orientation anchored early in studio/canyon; single scene tightens to charged closure image. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "damp stone and iron" and echoes twisting voice filter through Kael's priorities, guiding climb to tower. Bone towers and mist spire constrain action (ascent/painting site) and charge final glow. Economy strong; no white-room or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract truth vs. elders' ritual) signaled early, escalates causally via painting/recital narrowing options to disruption. Agency in raw recitation forces elders' falter and light burst; cost legible in heretic foreknowledge charging poise. One tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as weapon emerges organically from "Forgive" ink and light refraction reweighting elders' control illusion. Final image ("mist clung to the spire") offers non-literal answer without moralizing; earned via particulars, not platitudes. Resists tidy binaries with curiosity softening fury.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing ("echoes...mocking"); voice modulates rhythmically to raw recital under stress. Dialogue natural/subtextual: Kael's "rituals are just poems we’ve forgotten how to rewrite" pursues goal vs. elder's hiss. No head-hopping; elision absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion; high density integrates sensory/action (e.g., "ink seeped...glowing faintly"). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("crooked teeth," "bruised sky") risks density dip but voice-motivated for artist; no loops, artifacts, or closure muddle. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetry as disruptive prism in bone-tower canyon transforms rebel-artist trope via refraction mechanics tied to closure light-burst. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative templates, hindsight inevitability in "Forgive" triggering cascade.</comment>
