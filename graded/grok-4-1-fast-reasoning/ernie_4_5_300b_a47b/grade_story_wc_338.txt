<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concrete interiority like "breath fogged the projector lens" embodies curiosity under pressure; micro-choices (aligning sextant, ear to stone) reveal values with escalating commitment. Final realization earned via prior discoveries, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from map tear to film comparisons to live hum, culminating in CR where chapel reconfigures silence as bridge with felt warmth/cost. Orientation anchored early in vault; one tightening (static films to audible chant) narrows interpretive options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "rain-scoured frescoes" and "moss-buried stones" filter through Elias's perceptual bias, constraining choices (vault chill seeps into bones, sextant alignment). Central stone charges final descent image, mirroring internal shift from cold to warm silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen silence) signaled early via journal; meaningful deepening at stone hum forces empathetic listening with narrowing options. Agency in holy water choice forecloses metaphorical reading; cost legible in shuddering stones and enveloping silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-language emerges organically from film shifts and hum to chapel realization, reweighting map tear as invitation without statement. Final "lullaby for the methodically curious" offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity in "other silences."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (seeing "borders where others saw blankness"); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory ("hands steady despite weight") to charged ("chest tightened"). No dialogue; purposeful compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short hum sentences accelerate); metaphors like "broken halos" cohere without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; opening "jagged tear" recharges in final reframing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of films/decades-spanning puzzle transforms henge trope into silence-language bridge. Risky quiet CR on conceptual cost feels inevitable; no close famous echoes.</comment>
