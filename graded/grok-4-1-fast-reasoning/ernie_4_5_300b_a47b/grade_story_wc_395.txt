<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to uncover Elara's truth intensifies credibly through micro-choices like cracking encryption and holding the patch against Hale, earning her final resolve; embodied tension in pulse and trembling fingers adds specificity. Hale applies targeted pressure as secondary. Minor flaw: competent digging lacks deeper internal contradiction until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: numbers lead to files to video to coordinates, culminating in on-page upload (DC) with drone cost as Lira "was already gone." Orientation anchored early in archive. Single tightening via video reveal suffices; no shards or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Humming servers, holographic interface, and rough patch constrain digging and charge confrontation (held up defiantly). Sensory details (cold light, crackling voice) filter through Lira's priorities, vivid yet economical. Patch as micro-setting reweights closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. erasure) signaled early, tightens via video to Hale/drones; causal agency in upload forecloses compliance path with pursuit cost legible. Coherent pressure narrows options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. erasure emerges organically from numbers/messages and gateway reveal, resonating in final "world remembered" without statement; patch and shadows subtly reweight via particulars. Complexity lingers in company void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (numbers in periphery); voice textured in sci-fi diction like "ghostly impressions." Dialogue carries subtext (Hale's "sentimental value") and advances to confrontation naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density overall; rhythm varies well. Minor artifacts: repeated "smooth/practiced lie" phrasing and "fake" descriptors create small paraphrase loop in Hale beats, dulling slightly without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archive as memory labyrinth with numbers/gateway deleting lives transforms conspiracy trope; patch and coordinates feel inevitable from causal pattern. Bold sci-fi risk in "erasing lives" premise pays off organically.</comment>
