<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses in "haunted euphoria—the dread that beauty fades, the thrill that it might not" driving micro-choices like painting the locket. Final stance of preservation through now is earned via prior causality in her ritual acts. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like doubt compound gently before reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual setup to photo's trouble to final realization, with on-page Conceptual Repricing in "The covenant’s weight... was in the now, in the act of preservation itself." Orientation anchors immediately in first line; cost legible in ongoing attention as she walks away, jetty sighing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains choices (kneeling, pressing locket, roots twisting planks) and charges final image (flowers closing as if in prayer). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (salt/jasmine, pulsing petals like hearts); environment evolves with twilight, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving unraveling covenant) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via photo's humanity troubling her, narrowing to attention as agency. One tightening in painting locket forecloses sacrifice path; cost felt in "hands, stained with ink and salt." Coheres under lens without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of small moments anchoring eternity emerges organically from particulars like baker's bread and locket; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (inking tarnish spreading like shadow) invites ambiguity on beauty's fade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing echoes, slanted light through archivist bias); rhythmic control modulates from patient description to charged poise in ending. Prose texture lyric yet legible, syntax reflecting meditative state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "dipping her brush into a jar of walnut ink" advances ritual/action/character); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (petals pulsing like tiny hearts). Propulsion aligns with accumulative deepening to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist ritual and sea covenant via proximate causes transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, with locket's evolution feeling inevitable. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universality.</comment>
