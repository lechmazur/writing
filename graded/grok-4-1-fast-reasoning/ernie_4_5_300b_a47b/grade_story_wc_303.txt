<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in throne vs. garden visions acting simultaneously; embodied in trembling hands and melting ice shards caught in palms. Final renunciation earned by perforated destiny's cost. Minor abstraction in "mulberry ache" lacks deeper visceral punch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via pulsing violin and stains, holds to Charged Poise closure in "dismantle the dream, piece by piece, until only the ache remained" with legible conceptual cost of perforated future. Single scene anchored by para 1. Orientation clear, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice violin as micro-setting constrains choices (touch melts, strings snap) and charges final shatter into stardust. Sensory hierarchy: plants whisper warnings, coffee swirls galaxy-like, filtered through telepathic quirk. Velvet walls exhale tension purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream-empire vs. simple life) signaled in coffee vision; accumulative tightening via strings snapping forces stance crystallization. Cost unmistakable in "holes in her own future" and persistent ache. Minor abstractness in stakes vs. visceral page tests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of propagating choices vs. destiny's perforations emerges organically from visions and violin; final stardust image resonantly reweights without moral. Subtext in plants/plants warnings layers ambiguity. No explicit statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in telepathic spills (plants curl like fists, violin thirsty). Lyrical rhythm modulates: short "Propagate" incantations heighten pressure. Voice particular, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric figs (coffee galaxy, strings liquid moonlight), but overwriting in high-pressure vision beat ("throne room, a crown, a shadow with her face") mixes vehicles slightly (−0.4). No loops; rhythm varies, closure propulsive. Varied syntax supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic provenance, ice violin, coffee divination transforms prophecy trope organically. Risky lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes; final stardust reconfiguration inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
