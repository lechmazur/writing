<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her gondola role and vial monitoring, with embodied tension ("tension in her shoulders") and internal shift from teaching to noticing silence feeling earned. Contradictory impulses surface in isolating chaos to amplify stillness. Minor slip: epiphany borders pseudo-profundity without rawer flaw exposure at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via vial patterns building to CR closure: "silence itself was speaking... a presence," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of prior method's foreclosure. Vial stilling moment tightens holistically. Orientation anchored early in canal/gondola; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism terrace and vial as micro-setting constrain choices (e.g., eastern gardens data informs routes) and charge final image ("gondola glided on, a blade cutting through the dark"). Sensory details (water lap, chime) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal rhythm without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach silence comfort) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vial's sudden stilling reversal, forcing realization that narrows options with felt cost in adjusted routes. Agency in deliberate shift choice; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as resonant presence emerges organically from vial/cloud patterns and whistle echo fading, culminating in non-literal CR: "not to silence the world, but to show it how to rest." Final image recharges without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature (refracting spires, vial spirals as emotional proxies); rhythm modulates from drifting observation to charged poise. Purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm (short chime sentence vs. flowing descriptions); purposeful figurative pattern (prisms/fractals) coherent without muddle. Minor artifact: adjacent "quiet" paraphrases ("quiet was deepening... vaulting hush") dull one transition slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm glass as silence detector in prism terrace transforms transit trope into textural epiphany; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes via vial's undeniable pivot without gimmick.</comment>
