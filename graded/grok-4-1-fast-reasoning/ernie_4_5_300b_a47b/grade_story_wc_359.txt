<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's synesthetic impulses act simultaneously in the singing beat, layering colors with contradictory subtlety versus force; final endurance of her gift earns the cavern's reconfiguration with flushed embodiment as cost. Veyra's skepticism yields credibly to the drifting song, altering his chisel drop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density tightens from oppressive silence to rippling ice during song swell; RR closure in harmonious exhale with unraveling as felt cost, charged by "sculpted hush remained, but now it sang."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-as-truth emerges organically through color-seeped song and Veyra's "honey and frost" whisper; final harmony image reweights premise without statement, embracing ambiguity in inevitable oscillation.</comment>
