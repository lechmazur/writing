<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses shine in the bear encounter ("fear dissolved into something softer"), compelling the touch micro-choice with visible cost (trembling hand); endurance of dream renunciation feels earned. Minor slip in reflective summary ("silence could be a kind of violence") borders stock phrasing but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably: sensory density builds from petrichor cue to forecourt song and bear harmony, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("keep was not a prison... a compass") with legible conceptual cost in her nod and lighter steps. Single scene with seamless transition; orientation anchored early in workshop details. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz forecourt as micro-setting constrains pivotal choice (touch elicits warmth/hum) and charges final image (lingering hum listened for); sensory hierarchy (petrichor, growl harmonizing) reflects Lira's priorities, evolving causally with rain and bear. Specificity anchors fantasy without tourism; body (ink-stained fingers) integrates tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace with abandoned dream) signaled early, tightens texturally via bear's growl-to-purr reversal, narrowing to curiosity-fueled touch; agency in reaching out forecloses fear path with embodied cost (throat tightens, trembling). Escalation coheres under lens, charging nod as stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of paused dreams vs. stasis emerges organically from particulars (gears ticking heart, forecourt song reweighting silence); final image ("silence between beats, where dreams breathe") offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on safety's cost. Bear/forecourt interplay deepens without allegory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (ticking motifs, resonant language) modulates rhythmically under pressure (short sentences at growl: "Lira froze."); whisper dialogue natural/subtextual. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.6<grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm (read-aloud flows from whirring mechanisms to bone-vibrating note); no loops, though hush/petichor recur purposefully. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("pendulum swinging between fear and hope") doesn't muddle peak bear beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork stasis and wild irruption (singing quartz/bear conductor) transforms tropes via resonant fantasy logic; risk in animal sentience pays off at harmony, heightening stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
