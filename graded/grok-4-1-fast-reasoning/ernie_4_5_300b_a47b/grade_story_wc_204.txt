<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to destabilize via whisper and frost patterns compels all micro-choices, embodied in her preternatural printing speed under patron gaze; resolute drive shows competence balanced by rupture risk, but lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from frost anomaly ("a spiral, perfect and unbroken") to printing frenzy and shatter, delivering Charged Poise RR/CR in library transformation; cost legible in "if the whisper escaped, it could unravel... clouds," with pattern tightening options cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard's dew, frost lattices, and press constrain Elara's tactics (distilling, engraving spiral); charges final image as "frost’s spiral, now etched into the air," with sensory hierarchy (ink/ozone, hum only she hears) mirroring her perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rupture for awakening) signaled early, tightens via anomaly forcing print decision that narrows to shatter risk; agency in holding page aloft forces trade-off, cost felt in shuddering shelves and roar under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of negotiated reality transforming via rupture emerges organically from frost-press-whisper chain, resonant in final "new spiral... waiting for the next operator"; reweights premise without moralizing, counter-readings in patrons' terror/wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (patterns, hums) biased to Elara's cryptic lens; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from silent work to "frantic clatter," purposeful compression taught early pays off in legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short frantic sentences at climax); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("pages flapping like wings"); propels via integrated sensory propulsion without overwriting in peak shatter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal library as fractal cage ruptured by dew-whisper-frost; risk-taking in Accumulative surrealism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via early pattern logic, no derivative echoes.</comment>
