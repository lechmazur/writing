<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority ("logical dreamer" via mathematical charting and journal shards) and embodied motivation intensifying to clarity surge; micro-choices like silver hair thread reveal values under pressure. Internal conflict subtle (other selves' erosion vs. persistence) but earned without contradiction on pivotal launch. Minor slip: epiphany warmth slightly abstract, not fully embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build (patterns emerge post-launch) to Charged Poise closure: gauge steady as "coordinate only she could interpret," reconfiguring grotto as crossroads with conceptual cost (persistent quest vs. other selves' surrender). Orientation anchored early (grotto, tools by para 1). One tightening via balloon ascent pays off visions without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto constrains (stalactite anchor, currents for trials) and charges final image ("grotto’s mouth framed the sky"); bioluminescent algae pulses mirror internal "serene upheaval." Sensory selective/POV-biased (fogged brass, moss ledge via balloonist priorities). Evolves causally (brightens on silver thread, dims at end).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for hope) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via launch reversal (needle spins to 17, patterns/shimmers force clarity). Agency in weaving/ignition forecloses giving-up path with felt cost (other selves glimpsed). Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (hope as tactile vectors bridging timelines) emerges organically from particulars (dyed threads, visions); final "resonance that lingered in her bones" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in intentional design vs. chaos; ambiguity lingers (grotto secrets persist). No moralizing, earned via struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature ("lattice of observations," mathematical glow); voice modulates rhythmically (short hitch breath to humming air). No elision/opacity; perceptual bias selective (algae as breathing rock). Prose texture purposeful/lyric without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density/propulsion (every line advances observation/action); rhythm varies (long setup sentences to clipped "Trial balloon three"). Minor figurative density in climax ("skies from other lives") coherent, no muddle/loops. Clean syntax, no scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grotto physics malleable via balloonist patterns bridging timelines feels inevitable from particulars (gauge fluctuations, dyed threads). Bold lyric risk ( Accumulative visions) heightens stakes without gimmick; transforms tropes (dreamer in cave) via equations/hope.</comment>
