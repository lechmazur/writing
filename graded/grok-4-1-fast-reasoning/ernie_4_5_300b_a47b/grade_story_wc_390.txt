<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—logic via equations clashing with bone-deep resonance—embody "logically emotional" and compel resonator adaptation; ghost confrontation forces micro-choice hierarchy with visible exhaustion cost; minor label-speak like "logically emotional" slightly abstracts peak strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: faltering signature → resonator adjustment → ghost emergence → frequency match → dissolution with Elias's collapse as legible cost; single scene anchors orientation by para 2; Charged Poise closure reconfigures balance as bridge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and resonator constrain choices—kneeling on pulsing ice, boots crunching—while lighthouse beam charges final vigil image; sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) reflects engineer's bias; fleeting sunset subtly pressures timing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect key) tightens causally via ghost lunge/wail narrowing to pitch match; agency in resonator activation forecloses force path with Elias's blurring vision as felt cost; coherent pressure culminates in stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Harmony as bridge between fleshly/ethereal emerges from frequency clash, not statement; final lighthouse beam reweights premise non-literally; ghost's softening adds thematic ambiguity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with engineer-specific perceptual signature (frequencies as heartbeat/paradox); dialogue sparse/natural, subtext-laden ("You understand"); rhythm modulates from whirring hum to screaming clash under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax mirroring tension rise, high density in action beats; opener's metaphor density ("bled tangerine," "grinding ice") borders overwriting but integrates; no loops, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sonic resonator transforms ghost-trope via vibrational logic, yielding fresh "absolution" synthesis; adaptation inflects lighthouse legacy non-obviously; bold fleshly/ethereal risk heightens stakes organically.</comment>
