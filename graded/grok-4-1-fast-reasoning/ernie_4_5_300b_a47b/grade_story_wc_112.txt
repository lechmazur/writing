<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation rooted in director's words and her curiosity drives competent actions like recalibration, with embodied stress (sweat, stomach drop) during crisis; internal conflict mild but shown in overcompensation leading to thrash. Minor slip: traits like "obliging" more told than contradicted under pressure, but change in curiosity earned by stabilization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lever pull causes awakenings/flicker, forcing recalibration DC that stabilizes with station shudder cost; closure as Charged Poise in reaching for lever again reconfigures her drive. Orientation anchored early (station, Veyra, nexus task); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nexus/lever/gauntlets constrain choices (gripping, adjusting grids) and charge final reach; sensory mix (hum, fogged visor, vibration) filtered via Veyra's priorities, with "icy warmth" mirroring her draw to station. Evolves causally (flare to flicker to steady hum).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time via nexus) signaled early, tightens at flicker/thrash reversal narrowing options to recalibrate with agency/cost (shudder, sweat); causal escalation forces stance crystallization in success/curiosity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of bending time/reality awakening potential emerges via awakenings crisis and Veyra's stirred curiosity; final image (reaching for lever, icy warmth seeping) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (drawn to "icy warmth," time as taffy); voice lyrical yet consistent, modulating rhythm under stress (short urgent sentences at crisis); minimal dialogue natural (LUX urgent, director whisper).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "hands flew across the control panel"), varied rhythm; minor artifacts: "hush of beating wings at rest" loops twice, "icy warmth" recurs without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling peak recalibration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magnetic time-bending via alien flora/nexus in ammonia-cloud station; "time moves sideways" premise transformed through Veyra's personal awakening, avoiding template sci-fi via "subdued awakenings" and icy warmth motif.</comment>
