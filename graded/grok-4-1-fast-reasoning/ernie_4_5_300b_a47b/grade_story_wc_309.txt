<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in failures and automation drives choices like pouring vial and using sketch, with embodied tears at "tears freezing on his cheeks" showing cost; interiority concrete but epiphanic realization lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal keystone beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure via garden shift and "lingering luminance etched into his soul"; cost legible in emotional tears and path foreclosure; orientation anchored early, one tightening at vial pour opens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via mist walking and keystone pour, charging final rainbow image; sensory details like "shadows danced with a lingering luminance" purposeful and POV-filtered through mage's wonder; spatial choreography coherent across spire descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim sacred simple deepens accumulatively through fountain memories and sketch choice, narrowing grand magic path; agency in vial/sketch actions with felt tear-cost; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in simple emerges organically from exotic-to-mother's garden shift, reweighting premise in final laugh and rainbows without statement; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in magical noticing like "brilliant dimness"; rhythmic prose modulates effectively, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in opener like "dagger of frost" purposeful without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of failure-mage trope with automated creativity and personal garden repricing; keystone transformation feels earned and risks inward turn over spectacle.</comment>
