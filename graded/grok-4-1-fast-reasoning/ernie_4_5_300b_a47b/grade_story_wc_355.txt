<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to catalog silence roots actions like device assembly and humming, with embodied attunement to vibrations; interiority concrete via workshop rhythms. Final kinship earns change via prior resonance motif, but lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene. Pacifist trait ornamental, not pressuring choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence/resonance motifs builds to CR closure in diary's click and final image of carrying silences as bridges, with emotional cost legible in "strange kinship" realization. Orientation anchored early (workshop, diary by para 2). One tightening via clasp shudder amid fireworks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via vibrations/hums over visuals; workshop tools constrain assembly choice, fireworks rattle window to test focus. Recurring diary/window charge final image. Fireworks contrast internal stillness purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode grandmother's silence via diary) signaled early, tightens via frequency success foreclosing force methods, with agency in humming amid boom. Cost felt in emotional payoff reweighting silence. Lens escalation via motif density coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silence-as-language theme emerges via resonance events, diary entry, final reconfiguration to "bridges." Diary quote and closing lines verge on explicit moralizing, reducing subtext density; still lingers via particulars without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual bias to subtle rhythms/vibrations; lyrical diction modulates with intensity (low hum to shudder). No dialogue. Rhythmic control heightens resonance without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/motif advancement; rhythm varies with scene (short sentences at click). Minor overwriting in opening descriptors ("cobwebs clung to rusted tools") but purposeful for texture, no loops or artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frequency lock-opening tied to silence motif transforms inheritance trope. Ingenuity in vibration method/humming feels inevitable from setup. Risk in lyric resonance pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
