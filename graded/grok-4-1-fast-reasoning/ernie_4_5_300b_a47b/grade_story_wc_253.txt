<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between grief and defiant creation act vividly in the carving ritual; final endurance of ongoing whittling earned by prior micro-choices with visible emotional cost in bouquet's disintegration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as carving steps build density to Charged Poise closure; "She picked up the spoon, turning it in her hands. Tomorrow, she would carve another" reconfigures grief into resolve with undeniable cost of persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Turbines' shadows and hum constrain mood and charge final image; wood curls, knife, and bouquet tactilely mirror internal states, with "turbines’ shadows lengthened, merging with the coming night" as pivotal environmental payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of lightness amid grief escalates via accumulative deepening in carving stages, forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in "refusal to let grief be erased" felt through turbine drone and flower ash.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of remaking grief emerges organically from particulars like spoon polish as defiance; final whisper "Lightness... is the courage to carry both" offers resonant answer but borders explicit echo, slightly undercutting subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in ritualistic noticing ("The grain is the wood’s memory"); rhythmic control heightens carving beats without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in carving sequence; purposeful pattern in steps avoids loops, though minor syntactic similarity in narration ("Now, ... Next, ... Finally") tempers peak perfection without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian mandate with mundane carving ritual as ambiguous rebellion; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes organically through turbine-backed hush.</comment>
