<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to unravel lies is consistent and intensifies through personal confrontation, with embodied emotion in the "weight of revelation settling." Internal conflict emerges in acknowledging "the darkness within himself," but reflective summaries slightly dilute scene-specific micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from sundial shadow to warehouse blueprint, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in the final revelation where the sundial reconfigures as "a map to a way of seeing" with felt personal cost. Orientation anchors early in barge canal scene; single shard fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "water lapped gently" and "lantern flickered" integrate purposefully, with warehouse and sundial shadow constraining path to blueprint. Final image charges closure under warehouse glow mirroring internal clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of deciphering sundial tightens accumulatively via shadow shift to warehouse and blueprint discovery, narrowing to personal realization with cost in self-confrontation. One deepening suffices; captain's warning adds minor external pressure without resolving by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth amid lies emerges organically through sundial and "architecture of lies" blueprint, with final image resonating non-literally by reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in shadows and inscriptions invites reflection on perception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in relic-focused noticing; poetic voice modulates rhythmically from serene to revelatory. Brief captain dialogue natural and subtextual, distinguishing from Elias's interior.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "liquid silver," but minor paraphrase loops on sundial meaning ("not just a map... a key... a compass") and repetitive "lies" phrasing dull momentum in reflective beats; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphysical spin on legend-seeking via shadow-pointing sundial transforms trope into perceptual quest; blueprint as "manipulating truth" machine adds ingenious layer without template echoes.</comment>
