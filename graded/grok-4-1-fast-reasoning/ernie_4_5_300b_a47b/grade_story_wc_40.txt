<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in reticence versus urgency to share; contradictory impulses emerge in pacing with crystal and note-taking. Earned change from silence to testimony via crystal revelation, with visible cost in foreclosed reticence. Minor slip: colleagues' dismissal feels like unanchored backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from shelves to crystal reflection to notes; orientation anchors in first paragraph. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in final crystal image and "found his place," reweighting growth with cost of broken reticence. No orientation debt; lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal as micro-setting constrains revelation and charges final image, with vivid sensory selectivity (dust motes, ink scent, prismatic light). Library at dawn mirrors internal hush, evolving causally with sun rise. POV bias filters scholarly details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth patterns) signaled early, tightens via crystal's "sharpened" sequences under Accumulative lens, narrowing from observation to urgency. Agency in handling crystal and noting forecloses silent endurance with felt cost in "strange urgency to share." Escalation via density reweights options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fractured growth emerges organically from crystal mosaic, ivy/rumors analogies, to final reconfiguration without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in closing crystal affirmation reweights linear knowledge premise. Complexity lingers in messy beauty versus tidy categories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with scholarly perceptual signature (words over people, patterns in margins/dust). Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, poetic syntax modulating from hush to racing mind. No dialogue; purposeful compression of insights legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., crystal reflection guides hand/notes); rhythm varies with scene hush to urgency. Minor paraphrase loops on "patterns/fractured sequences" subtract without obscuring closure. No artifacts in peak realization; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library epiphany via crystal's sonic/visual facets transforming reticence into mosaic insight. Bold risk in lyric Accumulative build heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: crystal irreplaceable for fractured growth angle.</comment>
