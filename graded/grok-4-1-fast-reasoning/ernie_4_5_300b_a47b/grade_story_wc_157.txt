<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's rogue traits shine in grinning persistence and poetic quotes, compelling the pheromone test choice, but interior conflict feels light with minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Lillian applies selective pressure effectively. Final earning of place feels motivated without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: crashing lectures → audience → test → club entry → garden amplification, with legible tightening at moth arrow to hidden door. Charged Poise closure in glowing garden reconfigures defiance with conceptual cost of endless work. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse chaos (moths, tarantula, orchids) constrains test choice and charges final symphony image. Sensory details (humid air, musky pheromones) selective via Elias's priorities. Spatial choreography clear through sprint to orchids → hidden door.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amplify garden message via club/seed) signaled early, tightens at pheromone test narrowing entry options. Agency in release and planting forecloses safe academia path with felt defiance cost. Escalation causal, culminates in satellite-visible glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterned defiance emerges via plant Morse and fractal seed, resonant in glowing "RESIST" without moralizing. Final garden beacon reweights surveillance premise with social cost. Subtext in "candidly cryptic" echoes implies without stating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable on Elias, perceptual bias toward patterns/poetry fits rogue scholar. Dialogue subtextual ("Candidly cryptic") pursues goals. Rhythm modulates with stress (sprinted, quivering antennae).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in chaos convergence lines, but minor overwrite in fractal shadows/pulsing risks muddle in club scene. No loops; rhythm propels via varied sentences. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant-speak resistance transforms tropes via pheromones/moths test and seed warp. Risky chaos convergence heightens stakes organically. No close echoes; garden glow inevitable from priors.</comment>
