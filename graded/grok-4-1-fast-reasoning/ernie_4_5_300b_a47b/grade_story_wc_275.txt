<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses in redefining father's knife from severing to planting, embodied in calloused hands and soil work; final endurance of mission earned via micro-choices like burying the scrap, revealing value hierarchy with pacifist cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to CR closure (whispering "quiet" reconfigures chaos to continuity); cost legible in father's absence felt through final palm-to-dome image and sensed heartbeat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses constrain struggle (rigidity focuses bloom) and charge final image (dome hums as symphony of containment/release); sensory hierarchy (heat on skin, thorns, sifting sand) mirrors internal transformation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave continuity through chaos) signaled early and deepens texturally via ballast paradox to Charged Poise; agency in digging/humming forecloses violent path with felt cost of redefined knife/tools.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming chaos emerges organically from ballast/dome paradoxes, resonant non-literal answer in final "quiet" as seed/revolution reweighting ruins without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (farm's "whispers," "heartbeat") biased to senseless perception; rhythmic lyric texture modulates from reflective to poised, elisions purposeful and paid in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric repetition ("quiet" motif); varied rhythm propels accumulatively, minor metaphor density (e.g., "mosaic of shattered rhythms") coherent but borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tower farm inheritance transforming bounty hunter violence to growth via engraved paradox; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative design heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
