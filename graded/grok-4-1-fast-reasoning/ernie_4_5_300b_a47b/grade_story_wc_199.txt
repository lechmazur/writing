<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elinor's calloused hands and precise sorting root motivation concretely; micro-choice to prod the speck compels higher stakes, earning her final purposeful shift, though internal conflict remains more summarized than simultaneously acted pre-revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from routine interruption to leaf revelation; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with cost in "the moonstone dust speck flickered one last time before dissolving," reconfiguring prophecy into action without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor's mossy green haze and thinning branches into mist constrain movement to the edge, charging the monument-building and leaf-reading climax; selective sensory filter (dappled shadows, hush deepening) mirrors Elinor's sharpening focus without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode leaves signaled early and tightens via speck-prod to circling leaves under Accumulative lens; agency in twig-monuments forces revelation with felt cost of speck's dissolution, though no deep internal-external interweave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Folklore-as-bridge theme emerges organically from speck transformation and leaf markings to final "world...made sense," reweighting superstition via particulars; resonant non-literal answer in arbor leaning closer avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in reverent precision (fingers hovering, thumb prod); lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to anticipation without slippage, diction biased to sorter's tactile world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in light trails and circling leaves; minor overwriting in repeated "hush" motif purposeful for textural lens, no loops dulling closure image of dissolving speck.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skyborne arbor and monument-building transforms folklore trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to prophecy-action pivot without gimmickry.</comment>
