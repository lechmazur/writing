<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in stagnation, with embodied visions syncing heartbeat to drip; contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. pull) act in descent and touch; minor slip in tidy epiphany at "cartographer of her own heart" slightly unearned without deeper flaw confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ants/map/spiral builds to vision CR, reweighting life with cost in buried choices; orientation anchored by workbench/map in first graph; closure cost legible in fading vision and cold chip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (cicadas hum, bioluminescent flicker, obsidian etch) constrains path via ants' fissure and ivy; cavern cathedral mirrors internal vault, charging final beacon image without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel stagnation via promise) signaled early, deepens via chip vision narrowing escape to confrontation; cost felt in memories' echo; under Accumulative lens, pattern break in doorway forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of journey as self-cartography emerges organically from ants/doorway/map; final image ("following the ants home... cartographer of her own heart") reweights premise non-literally, lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (dusty labyrinths, map squint); voice modulates rhythm in descent tension; brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You’re just following the ants") advances revelation cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, strong verbs (pried, hummed, dissolved); figurative density borders overwriting in cavern ("frozen tears," "emerald shards") but integrates without muddle; no loops, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of printing relic as memory key transforms quest trope via ants' empirical path; risk in vision shard pays off in CR; specific details (matrix pits, type foundry) feel inevitable hindsight.</comment>
