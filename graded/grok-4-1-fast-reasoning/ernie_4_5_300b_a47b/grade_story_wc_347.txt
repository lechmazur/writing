<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's reluctance shines in hating the birds yet risking detection to place markers, with jerky movements embodying internal conflict. Contradictory impulses act in the door-shoving beat, earning the curse's temporary satisfaction as Earned Stasis. Minor limit: traveler interaction too brief to deepen relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: cry → markers → door open → escape, with closure as Charged Poise when nut locks door and labyrinth shudders, cost in cracked shell and pulsing roots legible on final lines. Single scene anchored early (para 1), no orientation debt. One tightening via birds' dive narrows options without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliffside details (frost-tipped gravel, brass eyes whirring) constrain choices, birds grazing stones heighten climax pressure. Recurrent fountain/ivy and nut charge final retrace image. Sensory hierarchy (gears spitting sparks) reflects Kael's urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost/detection) signaled para 1, tightens causally at birds' screech forcing continued markers despite freeze. Agency in slamming door forecloses path with birds' convergence cost. Enters 8+ via trade-off but minor abstract curse without visceral loss on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Graceless order vs. curse emerges organically from tilted stones and snapped branches mirroring Kael's jerky acts. Final nut (cracked) reweights blueprint's precision with meddling cost, non-literal answer to imposed duty. Resists tidy moral via "for now" ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (hates birds' hum setting teeth on edge). Prose texture rhythmic, syntax modulates stress (short sentences at birds' dive). "Go" dialogue sparse but rasped goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "shadow pointing west" advances plot/atmosphere). Zero loops, varied rhythm accelerates to door slam; metaphors coherent (sap like blood primes nut). No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nut-blueprint relic enables "impressions without touching" in bird-patrolled maze transforms labyrinth trope. Risk in graceless markers heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from offhand map to cracked payoff.</comment>
