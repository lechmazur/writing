<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in sculpting trait drives portal choice and final reconfiguration; interiority embodied in calloused hands and racing brain under pressure. Minor epiphanic summary ("She reimagined her role") slightly abstracts peak shift without full contradiction in impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as slide discovery layers to visions and CR closure where sculptures reweight as maps with felt vibrational cost in final line. Orientation anchored early under archway; shard transition legible via portal step.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archway and sculptures as micro-settings constrain choices (press slide to keystone) and charge final image; sensory details like "damp moss" and "bruised sky" selectively urgent. Evolves causally from static to humming portal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reimagine history escalates texturally via deepening visions narrowing to guardian role; agency in pressing slide and picking up sculptures forecloses mere artistry path. Cost legible in "vibrating in her chest" at climax understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of simplicity scaffolding complexity emerges organically from sculptures' reinterpretation, resonant in final mermaid timeline image without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from time-threads question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias toward driftwood stories; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating to charged poise in village dissolution. Brief dialogue natural and goal-pursuing ("Teach me").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; varied syntax propels to closure. Minor overwriting in "images bloomed" metaphor string near portal but no loops or artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of driftwood art as time-maps transforms portal trope; risk in time-shard pays off in hindsight inevitability of sculpture reprise charging premise.</comment>
