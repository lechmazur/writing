<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength: embodied thrill in "She trembled, not from fear but from the thrill of the chase" reveals contradictory impulses under pressure. Motivation rooted in grandfather's legacy compels micro-choices like measuring adhesive fractures. Minor weakness: "slyly heartfelt" leans label-like without deeper trade-off in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of measurements building to revelation; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration in "She read the message aloud... Lira smiled," reweighting fear to trust with felt emotional cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in amphitheater setup. No disorientation or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amphitheater's breath and rumble constrain timing of decryption, mirroring internal tension and charging final "volcano’s breath a steady rhythm beneath her feet." Sensory details (clicking chain, molten-red stone) filtered through machinist POV, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decrypt compassion) signaled early, escalates via pattern emergence and "final link clicked," narrowing to stance crystallization under Accum lens. Agency in adhesive analysis drives deepening; cost legible in "fragile trust between strangers."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing values emerges organically from measurements balancing chaos/order, resonant in final image of coiled chain and forward walk without moralizing. Particulars like adhesive ghost avoid platitudes; complexity lingers in safety/risk tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via machinist lens ("measuring... distance and deceit"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short clicks in climax). Stable close-3rd POV, no head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Figurative density ("symphony of decryption," "spiderweb patterns") in peak decryption beat borders overwriting without full pattern payoff, dulling propulsion slightly. Motif repetition (breath, chain) purposeful but risks loop; strong verbs and varied rhythm elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of adhesive cipher via geological cipher in volcano transforms puzzle trope organically. Risky lyric premise commits fully, with decryption turn inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
