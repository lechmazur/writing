<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clara's contradictory impulses—family loyalty versus truth-seeking—act simultaneously in her handling of the nib and decision to expose, earning the final renunciation with family fallout cost. Interiority embodied via trembling nib and scarred palm. Micro-choices like cross-referencing reveal values hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: evidence density tightens from call to note discovery to dossier, culminating in CR closure via final compass realization reweighting regret's orbit with ongoing atonement cost. Orientation anchored early in observatory. One meaningful deepening at stained memo suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's gears and dome constrain solitude and charge final image (dome opens to pink sky), mirroring internal orbits. Sensory hierarchy (humming, echoing silence) reflects Clara's observant bias. Details integrated via goal-directed action like lamp-lit records.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth corruption) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through evidence deepening that forces exposure trade-off. Agency in proof-by-contradiction investigation forecloses legacy illusion with on-page cost (family weeping, lawyers). Climax confrontation narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth's scarring orbits emerges organically from nib handling and evidence unraveling, resonant in final "dance in their gravity" without moralizing. Subtext in journalist exchange implies incomplete atonement. Complexity lingers in black hole metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in celestial metaphors; voice modulates rhythmically from regretful introspection to steady resolve. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("changes everything"). No head-hopping, diction POV-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; minor metaphor density in opening ("celestial heartbeat") risks overwrite but integrates without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm breathes with scene urgency. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Astro metaphors transform family scandal trope freshly via nib-as-compass evolution. Nib's arc from relic to tool offers earned ingenuity. Risks solemn tone effectively without gimmickry.</comment>
