<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic memory-tasting drives precise pruning choices amid contradictory violent/gentle floods, embodying internal conflict; final notebook pull reveals value hierarchy with ongoing cost, though "gentle rebellion" borders on labeled trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as pruning cuts accumulate memory density to plant's shuddering transformation and future vision (RR/Charged Poise); cost legible in Elara's heaving chest and unsteady legs at peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse with moss-streaked panes and violet light constrains pruning under alignment, charging final golden glow image; synesthetic touch integrates sensory bias purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to transform plant tightens via escalating memory resistance and faster cuts under peaking light, forcing endurance agency; physical toll (trembling hands) forecloses easy paths on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pruning trauma for beauty emerges organically via memory shifts to future gardens; final bud vision reweights ruins premise non-literally, lingering with hopeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (tasting memories via touch) biases details character-specifically; rhythm quickens meditatively with pruning intensity, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density weaves action/memory/sensory without loops; rhythmic pruning sequence propels, though minor synonym churn in "memories flooded/surged" slightly dulls peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthesia + synaptic plant plasticity + knowledge fruit synthesizes fresh post-Collapse healing metaphor; pruning as neural rerouting risks bold ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
