<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied grief in ravine scene sync with polymerist lens; contradictory avoidance vs. connection impulses peak credibly in text response and studio entry. Earned change via micro-choices under pressure forecloses isolation path with relational cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "quantify loss" borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pivotal reconciliation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nature observations build density to CR closure in chrysalis release and career shift, reweighting divergence as connection with emotional cost legible in "space to breathe." Orientation anchored early at river's edge; shards transition legibly via insight pattern taught by foam moment. One tightening via phone text narrows options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Braided ravine and foam patterns filter through Elara's chemist bias, constraining insight (test tube dip) and charging final image of rivers weaving. Sensory hierarchy vivid and purposeful: froth touch, roar hum. No white-room; spatial choreography clear in wading deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement via reconnection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through foam insight forcing studio confrontation; agency in responding to text and release forecloses divergence path. Cost felt in raw voice hitch and weeks-later return. Minor abstractness in stakes ("hollow space") but pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of divergence as bridge emerges organically from rivers/chrysalis/music particulars, resonating in final "separate streams... shared horizon" without full moralizing. Earned via struggle, invites ambiguity on grief's permanence. Weakness: line "separation isn’t an end. It’s a prelude to connection" echoes thesis too directly in penultimate beat, diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with symphonic rhythm modulates intensity, perceptual signature chemist-specific (foam as surfactants). Stable single POV, clean free indirect; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Afraid to finish the song") advances harmony. No head-hopping, diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via image integration; opening anchors stakes poetically. Minor paraphrase loop in repeated "pieces fell into place" and foam reform descriptions dulls mid-beat slightly (−0.4). No scaffold in closure; metaphors cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer/river/music metaphors transforms grief trope via specific insights (foam unity, braided collaboration). Risky mosaic shards heighten resonance without gimmick; irreplaceable chrysalis-rivers link feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
