<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority via feather relic and embodied warmth in chest ties to motivation for belonging; researchers apply light pressure via gasps and laughter. Minor slip in tidy realization ("She realized then that belonging was not about fitting") borders diagnostic without full embodied cost, but closure endurance feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from steady glow to biolum bursts to crescendo peak before sunrise. Closure as Charged Poise in final feather trace and sunlight image reconfigures isolation with felt endurance cost. Orientation anchored early in dome and city decay; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dome glass fog and biolum pulses constrain observation, charging final sunlight filter; feather as micro-setting recurs to mirror internal rhythm. Sensory hierarchy via Mara's astrologer bias sharpens light patterns over decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing alignment for belonging escalates via pattern shift tightening to peak under accumulative lens, narrowing skepticism to awe. Agency in inviting/sharing forecloses isolation path with warmth cost, but stakes lean abstract over visceral until gasps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as chaotic symphony emerges organically from light dance and feather endurance; final image reweights premise without moral. Subtext in researchers' forgotten skepticism adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in light/shadow noticing; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("See?"). Lyrical rhythm modulates to crescendo without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density in light bursts integrates action/atmosphere; varied rhythm peaks at "crescendo that left them breathless." Minor "rhythm" recurrence purposeful, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Underwater astrology transforms decay trope into resonant sky-sea link; feather-surface relic inflects belonging fresh. High-band cap applied due to Q4 under 8.2.</comment>
