<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete embodiment (calloused hands, fogged spectacles) and micro-choices (scraping vial, monitoring chrysalis); final humility earned through endurance against institute pressure, revealing contradictory impulses between cosmic expertise and earthly humility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from dust sample to chrysalis spiral to symposium CR closure; cost legible in ignored institute demands and evolved research stance; orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting (shattered pots, silt-clogged drains, snapped bamboo) constrains choices and charges final image via dust evolution; sensory details (iridescent dust, fungal growth) filtered through scientific POV bias purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (modeling recovery via dust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through chrysalis catalyst forcing endurance vs. institute; visible cost in symposium risk and foreclosed cosmic-only path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges organically from dust patterns and chrysalis to resonant final reconfiguration (evolved via greenhouse), reweighting premise without moralizing; botanist exchange offers non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (stellar metaphors like "dying pulsar" frond); voice modulates rhythmically, prose texture distinct and biased toward scientific idiom without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors integrated into action; minor simile density in opening but pattern-taught for voice; no loops, clean propulsion, varied rhythm supports accumulative build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron stars and greenhouse entropy via butterfly dust transforms tropes; risk in symposium pivot heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
