<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's metaphor-driven insight and Elias's hesitation-to-resolution arc earn the climax choice at the piano; distinct voices and flawed competence (insane methods) reveal character under pressure without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain anchors early (archive summons, bottle prop) and tightens to on-page closure: Elias finishes song, releasing resonance with legible cost (empty bottle, resolved guilt); lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive's dust/regret and piano soundboard constrain climax drop and playing; orchard hush charges final chainsaw roar as payoff image mirroring silence's end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant reconnection stake tightens via voice reversal ("You left me"), forcing Elias's agency in finishing song; cost (guilt loop broken imperfectly) viscerally felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Resonance-as-memory emerges organically through events, culminating in "finishing the song... imperfectly" as non-literal answer reweighting ghost premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (regret-currency lens) with rhythmic poetic diction; dialogue subtext-driven ("haunted by a minor key") advances goals naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in causal beats, varied rhythm; minor overwriting density in opening metaphors ("prismatic shards") but no loops or artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exorcism via copper-dove currents and music vibration synthesizes fresh physics-metaphor premise; risk in "resonance not ghost" reconfigures tropes organically to charge closure.</comment>
