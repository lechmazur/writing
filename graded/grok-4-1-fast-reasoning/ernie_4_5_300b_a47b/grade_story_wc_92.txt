<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kieran's vigilant motivation intensifies via blackout stakes, compelling shared deciphering; Elara's inventive trait enables pattern-matching micro-choice. Internal contradiction light but embodied in risk-embracing grin at descent. Final unity earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: whispers→Elara's arrival→parchment sequence→quill insertion yields DC staircase with Council test cost legible in "blackout as test" line. Orientation anchored by ~50 words at Tower door. Single scene coherence perfect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blackout shadows and starlit quill constrain hushed actions; sundial micro-setting guides panel press and charges reveal. Sensory narrowing to hum/click mirrors urgency. Twilight fort evolves from aglow to deepening dark purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cradle access amid Council test) signaled early, tightens via Elara's sequence match narrowing options to immediate act. Agency in joint tracing/insertion forecloses exposure risk with felt cost in descent. Causal escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sparks motif shifts from quill ember to cradle ideas, reweighting Council's "iron and illusion" via final flickering light image. Subtext in loaded glances emerges organically without statement. Complexity in quiet dissent vs overt force lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable Kieran-limited POV with perceptual sundial bias; dialogue subtext pursues alliance ("cracked it?"). Rhythmic hush modulates tension, distinct voices in murmurs vs calculations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density weaves setting into action without loops; rhythm varies to accelerate "low hum... shifted." Minor stock "jaw tightened/eyes gleamed/heart racing" slightly dulls peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sundial cipher via quill transforms intrigue trope into idea-sparked revolution; cradle network fresh synthesis of inventor dissent. Risky hush amid blackout heightens without gimmick.</comment>
