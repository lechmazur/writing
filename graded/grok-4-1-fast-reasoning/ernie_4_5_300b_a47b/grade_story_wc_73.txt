<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist traits drive concrete micro-choices like die-rolling and fist-rupture under obsession-surrender tension; final renunciation of possession earned via prior tests, with embodied cost in exhaustion and unreachable dice. Contradictory impulses act in-scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via loops/proofs to rupture's Charged Poise closure, where dice-orbit image reconfigures loss's texture with conceptual cost ("space between the dice"). Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Staircase as micro-setting constrains all tactics (directionless pacing, edge-bracing for rupture) and charges final image (shuddering steps, orbiting dice); sensory hierarchy (ozone/regret air, stone-shimmer) reflects Kael's priorities. Satisfies 9+ test via constraint on choice and closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (perpetual motion for loss-texture) tightens via rupture-agency: success forecloses possession-path with on-page cost (dice dance out of reach, brittle laugh of exhaustion). Escalation under textural lens via decisive cadence shift; 9+ test met by agency-driven deepening and legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss-texture emerges organically from dice/proofs/rupture particulars, culminating in resonant final image ("confinement... boundless, but... felt its rhythm") that reweights premise without moralizing. Satisfies 9+ test: non-literal answer recharges priors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "air tasted of ozone and regret"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure (short sentences at rupture: "The impact sent... world held its breath. Then, the step... ruptured"). No head-hopping; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/stakes (e.g., proofs etched "like a second skeleton"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (Möbius strip). Satisfies 9+ test: clean propulsion, no figurative muddle at peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of infinite-staircase/perpetual-motion/loss-texture via chipped die's flaw and rupture-orbit; risk-taking in surreal logic heightens stakes coherently, inevitable in hindsight. Bold premise transformation satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
