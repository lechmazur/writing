<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in enduring trauma while seeking quantifiable mercy act in scene via proprioceptive flares and strap grips; final "I'm bracing" earned by layered internal conflict with embodied cost in spore burns and tree sync. Minor abstract "therapy-speak" in "let the trauma teach you" edges from perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from forest reactions to spores/woman dialogue culminating in CR closure ("mathematics of mercy take root... hope") with conceptual endurance cost legible in "let go of the tree trunk... walked deeper." Woman's snap-branch emergence feels slightly unmotivated coincidence, preventing 8.8+ gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>UV forest pulses/spores constrain choices (nerves firing, skin flaring) and charge final image (light dims as steps sure); body/strap as micro-setting filters hyper-aware proprioception purposefully. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify mercy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via spore penance and dialogue to "I'm bracing" renunciation/endurance foreclosing flinching path; cost felt in burning skin and exhaled past. Agency in micro-choices like forehead press.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as unmeasurable endurance emerges organically from fractals/spores/strap, reweighted non-literally in final walk's "question" with lingering ambiguity; no moralizing, resonance from particulars like "ultraviolet penance."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in math-patterned glows and proprioceptive echoes; dialogue subtextual ("Mercy isn’t an equation. It’s a choice") advances stakes naturally, voices distinct. Rhythmic control heightens under spore pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "spores settled... burning faintly"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful UV/strap recurrence without muddle. Minor "mused" repetition voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma-rewired survivor in reactive UV forest transforms tropes via proprioceptive math mercy; bold alien biology/penance risks heighten stakes organically to charged CR close.</comment>
