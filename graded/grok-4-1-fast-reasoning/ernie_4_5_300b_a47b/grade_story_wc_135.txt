<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to compile fragments is consistent and drives micro-choices like placing the valve, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat, such as doubt during waits; competence dominates without genuine struggle compounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via staggered intervals holds to CR closure in trumpet's note reweighting history as mosaic; orientation anchored in first paragraph; shards taught by 25% with legible transitions and conceptual cost of patience legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring valve constrains choices across sites and charges final museum image; sensory details (salt-sting, tide pooling) filtered through Lirael's absence-focus evolve harbor from scarred to thriving without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fragments to meaning) escalates accumulatively via deepening revelations (journal → tales → locket); agency in repeated visits forecloses haste path with patience cost felt across beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mosaic history emerges organically from fragment collisions; final trumpet note offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting absences without moralizing, embracing patience's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (absences, spray); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (fisherman's squint, girl's clutch) advances plot; rhythm modulates with patient cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks; varied rhythm propels via image integration (e.g., "boots tapping a hollow rhythm"); figurative language purposeful without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-hunt trope via staggered patience mosaic transforms into history-healing; risk in shard structure heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
