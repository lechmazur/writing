<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear of unraveling vs readiness to open box) act in scene, earning the final enlightened stance; self-blame flaw drives micro-choices like tipping the hourglass with embodied cost (throat tightens). Interiority concrete and particular (scars biting brow, reading land's breath). Final renunciation of haunting feels compelled by causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from climb to hourglass tip to acceptance, with CR closure in "pain, too, could be a kind of fertilizer" reweighting self-blame at undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchored early (ridge path, helmet). Single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ridge path and moon constrain ascent and reflection, charging final image ("moonlit path guided him"); sensory hierarchy (frost crunch, breath fogging) reflects firefighter's attuned perception. Details evolve causally (stars fading to dawn mirrors acceptance). Micro-setting (porcelain box) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront past guilt) signaled early, deepens via hourglass memories forcing realization; agency in opening/tipping creates internal reversal narrowing haunted options. Cost legible in resurfaced screams yielding to acceptance. Accumulative escalation coherent without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pain-as-transformation emerges organically from fire regrowth parallel and hourglass shift, resonating in final non-literal image ("sand began to move again... forest seemed to sigh") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in mother's note layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (nature rhythms as language); rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure (short sentences in memory surge). Prose texture distinct (lyric yet grounded lexicon). No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sand trickled, slow as glacial melt, pooling at the bottom" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor figurative density in peak reflection ("stars pirouetted") coherent for textural lens, no muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter scars and maternal hourglass transforms guilt trope into cosmic acceptance; ridge as "threshold" inflects uniquely. Risk in lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
