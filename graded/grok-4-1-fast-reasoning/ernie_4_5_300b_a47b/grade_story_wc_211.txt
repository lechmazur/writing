<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to archive emotions clear and consistent, embodied in trembling fingers and bone resonance; interiority concrete via memory immersion. Minor slip: epiphany at "The roots remember, and the leaves will scream" feels slightly unearned without stronger contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from wax grooves to hum discovery tightening to CR closure (awakening reconfigures silence as pause). Orientation anchored early; cost legible in final resolve to listen amid impending cry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden setting vivid and selective, constraining choices (breath-dependent roses, tree pulse mirroring introspection) and charging final image (canopy-stars counterpoint to hum). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific; no white-room, evolves with playback.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode prophecy for archiving) signaled early, escalates via lens-appropriate density (shriek → hum match narrows to awakening); agency in playback immersion forecloses ignorance with felt cost of acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory/preservation emerges organically from wax-tree patterns, reweighted non-literally in CR (roots/leaves scream as awakening, not disaster). Resonant final image answers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (dead languages, emotional vibrations); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation under memory stress. No head-hopping; diction controlled and biased to scribe's archival lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm in playback beat; purposeful lyricism without muddle. Minor paraphrase loop in "roots remember" repetitions, but pattern-taught and charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phonograph prophecy in rooftop orchard transforms tropes (forgotten languages, apocalyptic silence) via specific emotional archiving; risk in velvet disquiet tone heightens inevitability of CR.</comment>
