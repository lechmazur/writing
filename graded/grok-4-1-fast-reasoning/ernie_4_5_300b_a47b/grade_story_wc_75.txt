<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to rescue arts roots in traits like historical orientation and intensifies via beekeeper's absence into festival choice, with embodied dread vs. resolve showing contradiction; final teaching/baking earned with fragile cost of lingering ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds across mosaic shards taught early via daily resolve; closure as Charged Poise in nightfall songs/loaf lift reconfigures arts' fate with legible cost ("rosewater dread remained, a undertone"), no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (waterfall roar, dough warmth vs. damp cold, mist sunlight) filters through Lila's priorities, constrains baking/teaching, and charges final torch-lit lens/propped stone image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue dying arts) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via frayed voice to dough-kneading resolve to children teaching, narrowing to fragile optimism with felt cost of beekeeper absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of art's endurance amid displacement emerges organically from lens relic, baking vows, thawing cracks; final "loaves rose... art required patience" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (historical weaving into present); rhythmic modulation fits accumulative lyricism, minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Why’s it green?" reveals child pressure).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm (short punchy baking beats vs. flowing descriptives); minor repetition of "rosewater dread" motif purposeful, no loops or scaffold dulling closure loaf image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subterranean refugee artists, initial-baking revival, lens-filtered grief transforms preservation trope; risk in mosaic shards heightens thawing stakes organically.</comment>
