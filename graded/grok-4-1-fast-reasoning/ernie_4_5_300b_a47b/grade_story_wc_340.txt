<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's warmly inquisitive trait drives micro-choices like reading the diary and confronting the widow, with embodied tension in "chest tightened"; final sharing renunciation earns closure via prior discoveries, though contradictory impulses show more sequentially than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations (diary, goggles) build density to Charged Poise closure in "She’d find it," reconfiguring anguish/joy with widow's emotional cost legible on page; orientation anchors early (Mara in spire elevator), single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound spire and frosted glass constrain ascent-time choices and charge final image via goggles-revealed veins mirroring internal map; sensory details (creaking gears, fogged breath) selectively heighten urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel captain's truth/joy beneath anguish) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via goggles unfolding symbols narrowing interpretive options; agency in handling items forces widow confrontation with relational cost visible in her shaking hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of joy/anguish twins emerges organically from diary phrase and phoenix symbol shifting via interaction, resonant in final "flame flickered" without statement; subtext in widow's laugh reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (ice patterns via goggles); voice texture (rhythmic similes like "grinding like a tired heart") modulates pressure, dialogue subtextual ("I found… a story") advances goals distinctly from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax, high density integrates action/image; minor metaphor density in opening ("dust sparkled like starlight") borders overwrite without obscuring closure, no loops but occasional simile churn dulls peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of goggles as revelatory lens in ice-spire fantasy transforms servant-trope via ascending metaphor; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
