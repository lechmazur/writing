<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through documentation to book pull; embodied emotions like racing heart and smile with fear/excitement. Interiority concrete but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; steady resolve limits depth. Earned change at closure via pattern pursuit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from glow observation to cipher decoding to book reveal. Orientation anchored early in glowing library. Closure as Charged Poise/CR lands on-page with legible excitement/fear cost in final smile and ghostly script.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glow ripples and mist constrain choices by enabling delay measurements that guide to humming shelf. Sensory details purposeful and POV-filtered (Lira's sharp eyes note shifts). Final book reveal charges environment-body link.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unspoken library) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via emerging pattern and impending letter. Agency in documenting/tracing forecloses aimless search with time pressure cost. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of circular truths emerges organically from cipher/watch reversal and blank pages revealing unspoken words. Final image reweights premise non-literally with fear/excitement ambiguity. No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (restless eyes on glow patterns, resolve amid mist). Prose rhythm modulates with intensity; diction purposeful and biased. No dialogue; voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with integrated details; rhythm varies without loops. Minor repetition ("heart racing," "racing heart") but doesn't dull closure. Vivid propulsion in pattern-tracing beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-delay cipher and backward watch transforms trope library quest. Cyclically reversed pattern feels inevitable; risk in nonlinear decoding heightens stakes organically.</comment>
