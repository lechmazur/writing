<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in hesitation over pouring essence ("a risk that could leave him hollow") before the earned final choice with scarred hands as cost. Stoically sensitive trait embodied in absorbing failures while persisting through bleeding fingers. No unearned epiphanies; change forecloses paralysis path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as successive approximation builds density to Charged Poise closure: crozier fuses with "hands scarred, mind frayed" cost legible in final beat. Orientation anchored immediately in courtyard at twilight. Single scene causality intact, no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains choices via shuddering winds and ash, charging final bloom image; body as micro-setting in "knees numb... fingers bled." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (alchemical priorities like crozier hum). No white-room; evolves causally to reversed storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to vivify/mend interrupts destiny tightens accumulatively via silver-weaving failures narrowing to essence-pour agency with on-page scars/cost charging poise. One deepening forecloses hesitation option. Pressure coherent under lens to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges organically from crozier's break-to-fusion and nexus bloom, reweighting chaos/order without statement; final image non-literal answer to stifling destiny. Resonance from particulars like Veyra's echoed prophecy. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in alchemical bias (e.g., "silver into liquid threads"); rhythmic control modulates intensity to terse climax ("Vivify"). Prose texture distinct, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors coherent/purposeful (e.g., "wounded heart," "reversed storm") without muddle in peak; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. Rhythm varies read-aloud, varying lengths build to eruptive light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical vivification via essence-pour transforms bishop's crozier trope into destiny-interruption; bold "frozen bloom" risks poetic closure without gimmick. Organic premise follows implications fully.</comment>
