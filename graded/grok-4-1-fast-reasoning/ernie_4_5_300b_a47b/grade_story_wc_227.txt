<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied uncertainty in trembling hands and fume-burned inhalation drives micro-choices to closure; contradictory doubt vs. persistence acts in scene. Final renunciation of respirator feels earned via prior flaw exposure. Minor directness in "she finally understood" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories, charm sync, sea surge builds to CR closure where statue glows and seas still, reweighting premise with felt cost of bare lungs. Orientation anchored in opening para. No slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea fumes and copper pockmarks constrain choices (respirator removal risks dissolution); workshop gears sync with charm to charge final stasis image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to roar and burn under crisis. Micro-setting (charm, statue) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-mending via charm) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via statue query and surge forcing endurance choice; respirator removal forecloses safe path with visceral cost. Agency in pressing/narrating drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from scars-to-constellations shift and quilt/flask images, reweighting survival over perfection in final swirl without moralizing. Line "The kintsugi isn’t in the gold... It’s in the *choice* to mend" borders echo but integrates via action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with alchemist-biased perception (vials of "shattered starlight"); poetic rhythm modulates from whirring gears to stilled silence under stress. Statue voice rust-regret distinct. Perceptual signature charges oblivion edge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short gasps at surge); density high, metaphors purposeful (fumes "eating the air like a thief"). Minor stacking in opening ("lapped... fumes... pockmarks") but no loops or muddle at peak "swirled... storm of gold and glass."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Acid-sea kintsugi-alchemy synthesizes fresh from relics/quilts; charm-statue map turn inevitable from pockmarks setup. Risky bare-lung poise heightens dire enchantment without gimmick.</comment>
