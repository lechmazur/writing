<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila's motivation as euthanasia tourist roots actions like trawling and rescue in numbness, with embodied cold as welcome pain; contradictory impulses (detachment vs. instinctive hook with parasol tip) act simultaneously. Final flicker of peace earns stasis via prior causality without tidy epiphany. Minor abstractness in "fold in patience" diagnostic slightly limits peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from trawling routine to keening sound, fissure discovery, rescue, tightening to charged poise closure in final image of parasol tip in lap amid salt-frost wind. On-page cost legible in reweighted numbness (flicker of peace forecloses full surrender). Orientation anchored early (marina, changed, relief work); single scene with time ellipsis coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina vividly constrains trawling (ice chips feet, fissure glows blue) and charges final image (windborne salt-frost with parasol tip). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (cold numbs toes as life reminder); details evolve causally (fissure to hauled boat). Micro-object (parasol tip) as setting proxy enables pivotal hook.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness vs. recognizing "precise instant" for action) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sound to rescue tightening (agency in hooking boat forecloses passivity). Cost visible in traded exhaustion for flicker; no coincidence resolution. Minor abstract stake declaration slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of action within "fold in patience" emerges organically from trawling-rescue to final reweighting (peace reconfigures endings premise). Subtext in parasol fragility vs. utility; resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing. Recurring ice-wail motif charges without checklist force.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (frost-blurred edges mirror detachment); diction modulates from grueling work to closing poise. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("We all are"); no head-hopping, inference matches knowledge. Rhythmic control heightens keening discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "low, keening sound... emanate from the ice itself" multisensory advance); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor overwrites like repeated "fold" phrasing purposeful but borders scaffold; closure image clean. Strong verbs ground specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Parasol tip as rescue tool ingeniously transforms heirloom trope; drift-ice marina euthanasia-relief synthesis fresh angle on detachment. Risky abstract "fold in patience" paid off in charged poise; no template echoes, organic voice commits to premise.</comment>
