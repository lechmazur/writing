<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. charm) drive micro-choices like arranging shells; final repurposing feels earned with visible cost in burning sparks. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("tragically radiant") borders therapy abstraction but doesn't flatten pivotal climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building resonance density to RR closure (sparks repurpose memories, garden ashes); orientation anchors early (Lirael in velvet garden at twilight). Cost legible in shed skin and silent shells; no causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (humming shell, fogged breath, shuddering petals) evolve causally with action, mirroring internal states and constraining choices (dirt palm-press, shell circle). Recurring garden charges final ash image without overt symbolism; spatial coherence perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release isolation) signaled early, escalates via density increase (whisper to chorus to surge) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to agency-driven climax (reaching center forecloses hoarding). Cost unmistakable in ash and lightness; single tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pain-repurposing emerges organically from particulars (shell memories to sparks); final image (shell promise, stolen vow) offers resonant CR reweighting without moralizing. Subtext in evolving garden avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (scientific musings like "resonance structures"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short peak sentences at surge). No head-hopping or elision; voice coheres poetically yet grounded.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated image/action; minor overwriting in opening metaphors (mourning veils, ink shadows) risks muddle but doesn't obscure closure surge. No loops or scaffolds; purposeful repetition (archived, quarantined) builds texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of quarantine memories via resonance shells transforms isolation trope; velvet garden's evolution feels inevitable and risky. Non-obvious CR (stolen promise) heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
