<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation rooted in father's legacy drives concrete micro-choices like splinting the bird and lying about the coin, with embodied guilt ("second skin") showing contradiction. Secondary characters apply relevant pressure via the man's comment on her father during the pivotal fix. Minor slip in emotional summary at end slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from solitude to interaction to CR closure in dropping the sand grain, reweighting scars with felt emotional cost ("something loosen in her chest"). Orientation anchored early at lagoon; one tightening via family arrival tests stake. Cost legible in final image of vanishing spark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring black sand constrains handling in scooping/splinting/final drop, charging closure image; lagoon's tactile "hiss" and volcanic fertility mirror internal growth purposefully. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's priorities under alert instinct. No slips; micro-setting elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving scars sing tightens accumulatively via bird-fix testing past guilt, narrowing to release with agency in advice ("let her go"). Cost felt in Mara's fear and Lira's chest-loosening endurance. Entry to 8+ via trade-off, but no further agency-driven reversal limits peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of scars singing emerges organically from coin/bird/sand particulars, with final image offering resonant CR repricing without literal moral. Subtext in lie about coin's safety layers compassion's complexity. Minor explicitness in closing thought ("Compassion... sang") borders articulation but ties to image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (firefighter alertness, scar fixation); voice texture lyrical yet grounded, modulating rhythm in peak bird exam. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("I'm not him"), distinct from narration. No head-hopping; diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., sand scoop embodies stakes); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language patterned around scars/singing without muddle in closure beat. Minor repetition of "scars" across beats avoids penalty as motif charges end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-daughter firefighter proving growth via bird at volcanic site transforms redemption trope through textured scars motif. Risk in lyric CR ending heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes; particulars feel inevitable.</comment>
