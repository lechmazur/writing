<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's observant trait shown concretely in noticing wind curls and shadow shifts, driving flake scrutiny; interiority embodied in warm flake and fiddle play under rising pressure. Final choice to raise fiddle earned by causal buildup without safety-hedging. Minor abstract phrasing like "sculpt possibility" slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pixel patterns, music notes, and flutters build density to Charged Poise closure where flake smooths and reality reconfigures, cost legible in "frozen...luminous moment" blurring prior disbelief. Orientation anchored early at pullout post-hitchhiker; single scene with magical transition coherent. No causality breaks; micro-turn in flake warming tightens toward payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pine resin, engine oil, and ozone scents selectively heighten urgency; flake as micro-setting constrains choices by pulsing and shifting under observation. Mountains blurring mirrors internal fraying, charging final image shift; spatial choreography clear through guardrail to van glovebox.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode flake and access amnesty signaled early, escalates accumulatively via faster fiddle play narrowing to reality-blur vortex under lens. Protagonist agency in music forces stance crystallization; cost felt in foreclosed doubt as pixels vanish, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reshaping "never" emerges organically from flake pixels, flutters, and bridge-song without statement; final clear flake reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in Marisol's "it's a choice" implies ambiguity lingering post-shift. No moralizing; complexity in fragile words and luminous reset.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dynamic details like "rusted hinges" voice and selective noticing; lyrical diction modulates with intensity to short urgent sentences in vortex. Marisol's brief dialogue natural, goal-driven reveal; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene acceleration, high density in multi-job lines like flake discovery tying setting to plot; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors purposeful like "threads of light." Minor overwriting in "kaleidoscope of colors" cluster slightly dulls peak propulsion but clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folk fiddler magic, pixelated glass artifact, and amnesty transforms tropes into inevitable hinge at flake's clearing; risk in reality-fray premise heightens stakes without gimmick. "Scaffold wrap flutters" as frayed-reality code feels particular and hindsight-earned.</comment>
