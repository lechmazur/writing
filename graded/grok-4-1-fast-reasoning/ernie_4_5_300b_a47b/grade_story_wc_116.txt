<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in centuries of judgmental witnessing, intensifying to compel shedding self at the pool reflection; embodied in trembling fingers and scraping hands, with contradictory pause before dipping hand showing impulses in scene. Final endurance/renunciation of burden earned with felt cost of loosened reality grip. Minor abstraction in emotions keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build through folds culminating in Charged Poise RR at refuge where silence regenerates, cost legible in "shed another layer of self" and river vanishing. Orientation anchored early in library catacombs; no ambiguity, pattern taught via swan unfolds. Closure image of retracing lighter seals reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (decaying paper scent, algae-slick tunnel, iron-taste air) filters through keeper's priorities, constraining choices like fissure climb and pool dip. Recurring library veins and swan as micro-setting charge final abandonment image. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reaching regenerative silence signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fold-deepening (pool shattering path narrows options) to stance crystallization in silence. Agency in micro-choices (unfolding, pressing door) forecloses judgmental self with visible cost of erased river. One tightening sufficient, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of non-judgmental witnessing emerges organically from journey particulars, reweighted in final image where burden becomes bridge without moral statement. Resonant CR in loosening grip echoes premise, inviting ambiguity on reality's fragility. No tidy resolution, complexity in freedom's echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV with perceptual signature (creases as maps, silence seeping bones); syntax modulates rhythmically with intensity, purposeful compression taught early via folds. No head-hopping, diction biased to keeper's timeless decay-noticing. Elevated register fits mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation; metaphors consistent (roots as question marks, time pooling stagnant) without muddle in peak refuge beat. Minor paraphrase loops in silence motifs purposeful for accumulative texture, no scaffold obscuring closure. Propulsion strong, varied openings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library hermit quest via origami cartography transforms inner journey trope, risk in backward river and vanishing refuge heightens stakes organically. Core premise commits to entropic knowledge vs. silence without retreat, inevitable in hindsight swan abandonment.</comment>
