<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict via "confidently uncertain" mantra and guilt gnawing show contradictory impulses acting in the anomaly scene; final renunciation of control as fixer is earned through projection and Lira's pressure, with visible cost in hesitation before heading to farmer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore from wrong seeds to anomaly to holographic web projection changing knowledge; Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page as Elias tucks warm pen away and walks to apologize, with cost of relinquished control legible in "courage to let it bend him."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Anomaly setting constrains choices via reacting to pen touch and flickering gravity buckling knees; recurring pen charges final image as it hums warmly, filtered through Elias's celestial interpreter bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fix timeline tightens via web projection narrowing options from erasure to truth-telling; agency in closing eyes to "listen" drives escalation under causal lens, with cost of foreclosed control path felt in Lira's interruption of "what if."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Web of contingent relationships theme emerges organically from projection alternatives and Lira's guidance, reweighting editing premise; final image of fever breaking offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV Elias with perceptual signature in anomaly sensations and mantra; dialogue natural with subtext in Lira's "Trust the web," distinguishing voices without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like anomaly description advancing setting/action; varied rhythm supports propulsion, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of pen humming.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of history-editing via listening pen and reactive anomaly transforms time-manipulation trope; conceptual integrity in web logic commits fully, with risk-taking in holographic payoff heightening stakes.</comment>
