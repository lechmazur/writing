<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict peaks convincingly in hesitation over the pendant ("its symbols rearranging into a familiar pattern"), earning the toss with embodied homesickness and oath tension. Cultist applies precise pressure via dialogue. Minor abstraction in "dimensionally homesick heart" slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist density and interior focus build to closure RR via pendant toss ("sank with a hiss") and path step, reconfiguring boundaries with cultist's scream as felt cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single shard fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and moss path constrain climax choice, charging final image; ice-cracking feet and fountain ripples integrate tactilely with action. Sensory hierarchy fits feral POV (ears twitch, breath matches mist). No white-room; evolves causally from thickening mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (oath vs. homesick pull) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when pendant warms, forcing toss agency with cultist scream as visible cost. Pressure coheres without reversal overload. One deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty-as-home emerges organically via mist/path interplay, resonating in final line ("boundaries of light weren’t walls—they were doors") without statement. Subtext charges cultist dialogue and mentor reveal. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (mist as thought); voice rhythmic and feral-specific ("claws digging"). Dialogue subtextual and distinct ("I fear the light"). Minor filter in "mind’s eye" but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuration (mist "swallowing sound"); rhythm varies, no loops. Minor overwriting in opening mist metaphors slightly slows but pattern-taught pays off. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-between-planes and interiorizing transforms portal tropes; risk in foggy lucidity heightens stakes. Pendant symbols and mentor twist inevitable from setup. No derivatives; bold premise integrity.</comment>
