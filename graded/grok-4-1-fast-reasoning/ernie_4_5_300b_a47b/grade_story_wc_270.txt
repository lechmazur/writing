<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Insurgent grandmother's traits—Uprising fighter, plant telepathy—drive concrete micro-choices like decoding kite via palm press and planting embryo despite age, earning final renunciation of control with embodied cost (steady legs post-vision surge); contradictory impulses (tradition as cage/comfort) act simultaneously in digging beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: kite tangle → plant-decoded script → mud-tracing unseals hatch → embryo vision → nurture choice as CR, reconfiguring futures with conceptual cost legible in "thousand possible futures" branching and regime contrast; orientation anchored in opening paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs constrain via blistering soil during dig and steam around ankles, charging final image where sphere placement wakes earth/rocks/air; sensory hierarchy (sulfur mist, hot breeze) filters through POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition via relic) signaled early tightens causally when plants urge "before drones return," narrowing options to on-page dig/plant agency; cost visible in blistered hands and foreclosed regime-control path, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing destiny emerges organically from kite-script seed → embryo visions → planting, with final image ("plants sang... new beginning") as non-literal resonant answer reweighting tradition vs. control without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (plant "whispers" as roots/chlorophyll melody) biases noticing glyphs/soil; rhythmic control modulates from static hum to urgent song under stress, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density in beats like "script began to unravel... night-blooming cereus"; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("wounded bird... frayed edges flapping") during kite intro slightly dulls propulsion but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy + genetic embryo transforms tropes (ancient relic) via insurgent grandma's lived Uprising scars and kite-as-script vector, with risk-taking payoff in glow-seeping closure image feeling inevitable.</comment>
