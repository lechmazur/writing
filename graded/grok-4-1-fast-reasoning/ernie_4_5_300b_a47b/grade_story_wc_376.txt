<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's quill trait creates embodied contradiction and micro-choices under pressure, like detecting the lie in the vault confrontation. Keeper applies targeted opposition without diluting focus. Final renunciation of literal words for "seed" earns closure via prior causal buildup. Minor flaw: early backstory block slightly abstracts initial motivation before anchoring in quill wilting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: zinc plate → map → fens → vault discovery → confrontation → revelation tightens options sequentially. Orientation anchors by para 2 (Elara in Virelum post-oasis). Closure as CR lands on-page in orb whisper and "seed" realization with conceptual cost of repurposed truths. One meaningful tightening suffices; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse fens constrain navigation (nectar bribe snaps at heels), flytraps pressure choices. Orbs and quill charge final image (glows unfurling). Sensory details (spore-thick air, moss-slick floors) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring decay. Recurrent toxic amber sky reweights hope in climbing spirals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover mother's words) signaled early, tightens causally via quill lie-detection forcing confrontation. Agency in accusing thief narrows to truth trade-off. Cost legible in empty orb's grim recycle reveal, felt in "breath hitched." Minor abstractness in initial stakes before vault reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-nourishment emerges via quill pulses and orb seed, reweighting archive premise without moralizing. Keeper's "Candor in small moments" integrates as balm post-lie, not echo. Final image plants question non-literally: words fuel domes, yet presence seeds renewal. Counter-reading (hope vs. decay) lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (calligrapher's eye on patterns). Voice texture (shimmering ink, poisoned honey) modulates rhythmically under stress. Dialogue distinct: Elara steady, keeper rasping/wavering advances revelation with subtext. Minor filter-verb stacks in navigation dull one beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/prose (e.g., "maws snapping at her heels" propels). Varied rhythm avoids monotony; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density purposeful (wilts/rust), not overwriting in climax. Slight purple in "truth... nourishment" opener risks ear-test drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quill curse transforms lie-detection trope into compass constraining choices uniquely. Archive as recycled fuel offers fresh premise on memory/decay. Risky CR closure (empty yet seed) feels inevitable from map/orb buildup. No derivative echoes; synthesis organic.</comment>
