<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Insomniac poet's motivation to photosynthesize pain into beauty drives all choices, embodied in trembling hands and bolder verses; internal conflict resolves in earned sleep and song after centuries, with visible cost of foreclosed wakefulness. Contradictory impulses act in pausing work for postcard. Final planting/singing reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: postcard arrival patterns density increase to moss bloom/tree growth/sleep, culminating in Charged Poise RR where song reconfigures pain-beauty coexistence with conceptual cost of endless longing made tangible. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (shell, abyss, poet). One tightening via seed replacement suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing moss and slick shell exterior constrain choices (ventures out, plants in chamber) and charge final image (shell migration, billowing robe). Sensory hierarchy poetic/urgent (indigo sea, off-key wind). Details evolve causally (moss blooms, tree twists).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (insomnia/pain transmuted) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via postcard-inspired boldness to sleep/planting/singing, narrowing to shy certainty with felt cost of surrendered vigilance. Agency in leaving poems and final song forecloses isolation. Coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blossom armistice emerges organically from postcard/seed/tree, answered non-literally by final song blending pain/beauty without moralizing; resonant image reweights longing as offering. Complexity in coexistence lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (reef-shadow joy, nebula bruises); rhythmic syntax modulates from exhaustion to unstoppable certainty, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "photosynthesize pain") voice-motivated for poet; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts dull closure song image despite dense metaphors in peak bloom beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of shell-migration pilgrimage and pain-photosynthesis transforms isolation tropes; risk in century-eliding lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via seed-song payoff.</comment>
