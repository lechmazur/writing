<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots deeply in grandmother's letters, embodied in trembling fingers and tightening throat during psychometry; micro-choices like deepening the reading reveal spatial gift under pressure. Internal conflict emerges subtly in gasping realization of personal ties (green eyes). Earned shift to lifelong commitment feels credible via layered visions, though lacks sharper contradictory impulses in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/emotional density builds from palm-press flash to crystal flare and lilac scent as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting unused love as storable/redeemable with emotional cost in tears and resolve. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2. Single scene coherent; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projection booth vividly tactile (dust, rusted canister, scarred table) constrains isolation for psychometry, mirroring ache via rattling window and rain; crystal as micro-setting recurs to charge final pulse and lilac image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (emotional charge via hum). No white-room; evolves with condensation and creaks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate stored love) signaled para 1, tightens via vision-deepening that personalizes via Elise/Thomas (green eyes link), narrowing to booth as incubator under Accumulative lens. Agency in rewinding/focusing forecloses ignorance with felt ache/cost. Emotional price unmistakable in throat-tightening and tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redeemable unused love emerges organically from film visions and letters, culminating in non-literal lilac-resonant answer that reweights storage premise without moralizing. Subtext in unspoken grief layers via psychometry particulars. Complexity lingers in open commitment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "lattice of memories" and spatial visions; voice modulates rhythmically from hushed setup to pulsing close. Diction purposeful (glinted celluloid, frayed sprockets). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sense/action (e.g., "air thickened, and the rain’s rhythm... shifted"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in visions purposeful, not muddled. Clean grammar, precise causality in sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry on film strip transforms relic-hunt trope into emotional storage premise, grounded in 1947 Alhambra specificity; risk in supernatural visions pays off via earned CR without gimmick.</comment>
