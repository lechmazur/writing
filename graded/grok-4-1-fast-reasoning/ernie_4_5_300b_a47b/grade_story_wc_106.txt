<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior conflict peaks concretely when hesitating before offering the photo, revealing contradictory impulses to steal yet intuit the jar's demand, earning her transformation with the wilted lily as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, density builds from lily/starlight bypass to jar's dialogue test, landing CR closure as photo glows and lily wilts, reweighting theft with undeniable conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station's arched windows, pulsing jar, and pressure floor constrain infiltration choices; recurring glow motif charges closure image of illuminated photo as beacon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floral codes and moonbeam jar transforms heist trope, with reinterpretation of rules as garden seed risking bold poetic closure that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
