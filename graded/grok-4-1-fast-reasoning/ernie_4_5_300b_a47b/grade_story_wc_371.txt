<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's heuristically gentle pause before touching the bread reveals contradictory caution amid his quest, compelling the planting micro-choice with embodied trembling hands; eyes softening earns a subtle change without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify toward CR closure in the woman's confirmation and thriving garden reweighting "creeping normality" as a map; cost legible in "fragile hope" and calloused hands foreclosing passivity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard and tea house soil constrain planting choices and evolve with saplings' growth, charging the final garden image; sensory details like damp jasmine and humming walls filter through Elias's noticing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake to pierce the ordinary veil tightens texturally via bread's impossibility forcing planting agency, with garden growth and vanished bread reprise reweighting options; cost felt in steady calloused hands amid routine erosion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final realization reconfigures creeping normality from threat to "map where light seeps through," emerging organically from particulars like sunflower seed reprise without moralizing; resonates via charged garden image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of subtle tilts (flickering lights, paler roses) sustains third-limited POV; brief dialogue with woman carries crisp subtext on cracks, modulating rhythm under realization pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety in lyrical sentences propels accumulative density without loops; minor figurative density ("green flames," "vines clawed") purposeful for atmosphere, not muddling peak tea house hum or ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh guerrilla gardening synthesis transforms creeping normality trope via impossible bread and seed into magical-realist rebellion; risk of lyric quiet ending heightens fragile hope stakes coherently.</comment>
