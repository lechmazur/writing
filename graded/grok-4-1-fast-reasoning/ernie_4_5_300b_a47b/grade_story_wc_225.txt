<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via fidgeting and trembling fingers under guilt's pressure; contradictory impulses in threading guilt/hope/regret earn the final forgiveness realization. Epiphany at "some threads couldn’t be untangled—only woven into something new" borders tidy but anchors in memory cue, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of threads/memory builds to Resonant Reconfiguration closure as labyrinth dissolves with conceptual cost of accepted shared fault. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene with taught memory shard fits scope, one tightening via thread-pluck shifts knowledge/options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth and frayed threads constrain choices (reveals path, glows at center), charging final image; thunder's lull/texture mirrors internal hush. Sensory hierarchy (visual gleam, tactile tremble) reflects Alaric's priorities without catalog; frozen villagers evolve causally to rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via thread/memory deepening that forecloses denial with felt emotional cost. Plucking black thread reversal narrows to acceptance; agency in winnowing/decoding shows trade-off, visible in "weight on his chest lifting."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of weaving mistakes into redemption emerges organically from chess memory to tapestry/hush, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: labyrinth dissolution as "mistakes were moves, not endings," with ambiguity of ongoing journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in threading/chess metaphors; rhythmic diction modulates from fidgety tension to poised hush. Prose texture distinct (e.g., "fierce repose"), no head-hopping or withholding; compression of memory shard legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "platinum walls gleamed faintly, as if absorbing"); varied rhythm accelerates to closure without loops. Minor overwrite in thread hues (−0.3) and faint template stems in descriptions, but no closure touch or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess exile in self-labyrinth transforms tropes via "woven hush" and thread-winnowing; risk in Accumulative metaphor density heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration ("new pupil to find") inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
