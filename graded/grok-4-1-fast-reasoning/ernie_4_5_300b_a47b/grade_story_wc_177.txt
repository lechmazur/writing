<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Precisely playful nature shown concretely in tracing seal and dream-logic integration; contradictory foresight/hindsight impulses resolve in earned merger at "twin lenses focusing light." Minor epiphanic summary in life fragments slightly unembodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from seal to hologram, storm, dreams into CR closure; cost legible in "lessons lingered" and seal-as-compass foreclosing escape. Orientation anchored early in bunker/forest/storm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vines, bergamot/iron scent, rain-lashed leaves constrain dream bridge and charge final ruins image mirroring internal decay/renewal. Sensory selection purposeful, POV-biased to analyst's cracks and patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (paths choosing walkers) deepens accumulatively via hologram life-fragments and dream images narrowing to integration; agency in pressing seal and inviting chaos with felt cost in resilience embrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (seal emblem, wolf maze, vines) into non-literal answer of paths grown by integration; final "footsteps echoing in rebirth" reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of fractal/dream patterns stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from anticipation to radiant poise, diction purposeful for ethereal texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or muddle despite figurative vines/storm; propulsion clear in "images surged" peak without artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rewilded bunker relic and dream-storm transcendence transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens stakes via precisely playful lens on paths.</comment>
