<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation to reclaim battlefield via garden is rooted in soldier past and grandmother's teachings, with micro-choices like scattering pods and mixing fertilizer revealing values under struggle. Interiority concrete via bird-listening embodiment, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. Earned endurance closes with felt patience cost in "Time was a language he’d learned to speak fluently."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seeds to fertilizer to tern's "Khalis," culminating in Charged Poise closure surveying half-buried roots amid storm, reweighting ruin to hope with patience cost legible in final whisper "The earth remembers."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty's violet/gold flowers and salt/decay air constrain choice as test site where "saltwater and freshwater collided," mirroring internal defiance; twilight shift to indigo deepens flowers, charging final sway "like tiny flames."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of garden thriving in barren jetty signaled early tightens via bird-guided actions; agency in endurance forecloses quick fixes, with deepening tern cry forcing stance crystallization, cost felt in deliberate slowness against storm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of harmony from ruin emerges via bird/dead languages and garden acts, not stated; final image of swaying flowers reweights premise non-literally, resonating "earth remembers" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in deciphering bird trills as "dialect of loss"; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate care to light heart, diction biased to rhythms/concord.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/sensory (e.g., "brittle shells cracking open to release tiny, pale roots"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "sky bled" support accumulative tone without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-reef soldier-gardener speaking bird/dead languages transforms battlefield trope; "Khalis" as space between breaths inflects hope organically, risk in lyric accumulation heightens quiet closure.</comment>
