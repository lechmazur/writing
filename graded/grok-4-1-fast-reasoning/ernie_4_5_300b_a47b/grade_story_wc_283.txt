<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in prophecy-spinning trait, embodied in button-sorting micro-choices under time pressure from hourglass; final stance shift earned via causal buildup without unearned epiphany. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "quiet inspiration blooming" slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from search to sorting to echo revelation, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure ("future...a field to be planted") with legible conceptual cost of history's weight in final hourglass turn; orientation anchored early in warehouse details, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (sawdust boots, groaning beams) filter through Mara's relic-hunter bias, constraining choices via labyrinth crates; recurring "unearthed silence" and final window-to-cliffs image charge closure, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock echo for prophecy) signaled early, tightens texturally via sorting reversal that narrows options and yields voices; agency in cataloging forecloses fragile ignorance with felt time cost (trickling sand), charging final poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of malleable fate from past threads emerges organically via buttons/jar progression, reweighted non-literally in ending ("raw possibility...hers to spin") without moralizing; earned wisdom from concrete unraveling avoids platitudes, lingering ambiguity in prophecy's seeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (half-remembered tales sharpening like flint); lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose-as-character reflects Mara's inspired mind; no dialogue, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm, purposeful metaphors (sands shifting) integrated into action; minor repetition of "unearthed silence" (3x) creates tone without loop drag, but slight overwriting in opening sensory stack borders density issue pre-pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-hunt fantasy via buttons-as-memories unlocking echo jar transforms prophecy trope; risk in abstract canyon voices resolving concretely through tactile sorting heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without template echoes.</comment>
