<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to overwrite father's lies via lattice drives micro-choices like clutching metal and placing it beside father's, earning final endurance with embodied cost in hovering laugh. Internal conflict surfaces in "I’m not lying" tasting like ash against ghost's hiss. Figure's mirror-face confrontation reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene, but epiphanies like "lattice as pen" border unearned without deeper flaw-compounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from lattice rattle through blooming vines, wall shifts, chamber clink to final hovering laugh as Charged Poise CR, reweighting hush from drowning threat to sustaining prelude with conceptual cost in "bodies waited, but Elias no longer cared." Orientation anchors early in lighthouse prison. One tightening via scuffs-as-map suffices; lens holds to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Copperlight seeping "like old blood," lattice biting palm, and scuffs gnawing door constrain entry and map path, charging final image where lattice settles "into his bones" amid reef maw. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile urgency in grip and hinges screaming. Setting mirrors internal shift from regret to affirmation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of threading story vs. inherited lies tightens texturally via ghost's "it’ll drown you," figure's "finish the story," and chamber shudder narrowing to placement clink with felt cost in foreclosed path of running. Agency in stepping deeper and smiling "I’m not running. I’m writing" crystallizes stance. Escalation coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of self-authored truth vs. deceit emerges organically from lattice-pen realization and hush reweighting to prelude, resonating in final "found himself" without moralizing. Subtext in figure's dual eyes and ghost's proud silence invites ambiguity on redemption. Closing image answers "chasing hush" via wind-laugh, recharging priors non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters via Elias's salt-lies lens, with diction like "copperlight repose" modulating rhythm to pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual—"You’re late" pursues story-goal. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens in throat-tighten and breath hitch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "lattice rattled... hinges screaming" weaving action/atmosphere; rhythm varies without loops. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("vines of light creeping") but coherent/voice-motivated, not muddling closure. No scaffolds; final line recharges motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lattice-confessional as story-pen transforms ghost-trope into labyrinthine writing act, with hovering impossibilities synthesizing myth/memory freshly. Risky lyric compression of shards pays off in reef-view CR without gimmickry. Core premise of hush-chase feels inevitable hindsight via scuffs-map evolution.</comment>
