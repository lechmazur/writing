<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong peripheral focus trait shown through methodical light/mirror use and discovery of etchings, earning the final assembly; interiority concrete via sideways problem-solving. Minor slip: embodied emotions mostly told ("held his breath") without contradictory impulses acting in peak reassembly beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: daily mappings build density to Charged Poise closure at timer's hum and vial storage, with conceptual cost of wonder-as-preservation legible in final reflection/image. Orientation anchored early (cavern, timer, Elias); one tightening via hidden gear/noon-midnight alignments narrows to success without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz veins and light shifts constrain choices (mirror redirects reveal etchings) and charge final pulsing glow/hum; sensory hierarchy (damp stone, drip, acoustics) filtered through locksmith's priorities. Evolving environment mirrors internal states via rhythm harmonization without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore timer for echo harvest) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via light studies to reassembly reversal narrowing options; agency in micro-choices (tools, angles) with felt time cost across season. Climax cost legible in scabbed wound and latent energy hum, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of peripheral wonder vs. reason's cellar emerges organically from vial labeling and final door metaphor, reweighting premise in CR without moralizing; final image ("some doors open only when you stop looking directly") resonates as non-literal answer with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in angled observations and warped reflection; rhythmic prose modulates from methodical to humming intensity. Stable single POV with clean free indirect, no elision; diction purposeful (veined, thrum) reflects locksmith mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gears scattered like dead leaves" advances setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (wine, scab) without muddle in peak hum beat. Propulsion peaks crisply at "teeth clicking... air vibrate."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith in echo-harvest cavern transforms tropes via peripheral reverse-engineering; risk in wounded season frame heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight at peripheral miracle. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
