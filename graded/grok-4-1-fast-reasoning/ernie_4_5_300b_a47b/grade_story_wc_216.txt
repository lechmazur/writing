<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots deeply in grief and banker habits, with embodied prickle at skull during hum deepening; internal grief-wonder contradiction acts in urn placement; final renunciation of urn earned by prior layering, with felt cost of leaving relic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via object descriptions to mercury stilling and vision flicker; CR closure lands on-page as time reconfigured into mosaic, cost legible in urn left behind and shifted stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silo's corrugated moss-rust, metallic tang, cobwebs constrain hatch access and capsule reveal; recurring shadows shift with messages, charging final exit; body/urn as micro-setting enables timeless prickle, mirroring internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture) signaled early, tightens via urn-coil interaction narrowing to vision; agency in mental embedding forecloses clock-reliance path; cost felt in urn forfeiture, coherent under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as object-held mosaic emerges implicitly via coil-dancer, mercury-mirror shifts; final garage-sale whispers reweight entropy fear without moralizing, resonant via wife's laugh vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (frayed cufflinks habit, ledger echoes); rhythmic diction modulates to cooler air/shadow shifts; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., urn's "jagged edge a reminder" advances grief/stakes); minor figurative muddle in coil "dancer" during peak but pattern-taught; no loops, propulsion matches hum deepening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy silo, garage-message method, urn-time bridge transforms time-trope; risk in abstract capsule realized via tactile mercury/visions; inevitable hindsight from early architect notes.</comment>
