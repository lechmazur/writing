<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength in embodied nostalgia ("ache for moments before they faded") driving descent and measurements, revealing contradictory cling/release impulses. Final endurance of letting past shape her earned via prior participation. Minor slip in tidy summation at "She smiled, understanding now."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to vibrations and fog fracture tightening observation stake. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with conceptual cost in evaporation/forfeiture of clinging ("letting it shape you, like wind carving stone"). One meaningful deepening via hum resonating in bones.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: solid fog distorts shadows (measured twice), fractures force hurry, crystal hums under knees charging final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (archivist notes patterns, vibrations as memory). Evolves causally: fog sheens to cracks, puddles evaporate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive vs. live identity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via vibrations shifting to participation, fog cracks narrowing time/options. Agency in measuring/hurrying forecloses mere recording with felt cost (evaporating puddles take rain's memory). Cost legible in hurried final measurements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of living memory emerges organically from shadow conjectures, crystal hum, evaporation. Final image ("crystal... hum... louder... approval") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting archival premise without moralizing. Complexity in nostalgia's counter-reading lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: memory-pattern bias in noticing ("rain... etched patterns... residual vibrations"). Lyrical rhythm modulates from observational to resonant hush. Experimental fog-memory diction taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/propulsion (e.g., "boots clicking... marble worn smooth"). Varied rhythm, no loops beyond purposeful "hush" motif. Minor figurative density in opening fog ("gelatinous sheen... poured milk") purposeful, not muddling peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: solid fog as "memory's breath" distorts shadows/time, transforming archivist trope via lived crystal hum. Risky lyric fantasy integrates organically, heightens stakes in fog-fracture urgency without gimmick.</comment>
