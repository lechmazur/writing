<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's boredom as immortal roots clear motivation, with embodied hesitation ("thought terrified him") earning the closure choice against immortality's safety. Lira's sudden depth feels slightly unearned but applies pressure via relationship crucible. Internal conflict acts in scene through contradictory fear impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via because/therefore chain: storm warps escondite → amulet reacts → Lira appears → joint decision shatters anchors. Orientation anchored early in prismatic escondite during storm. Closure DC lands on-page with legible cost in Kael's fear of unknown ("chasm he wasn’t sure he could leap").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite vividly constrains navigation ("boots silent on iridescent floor") and charges mirrors' final image of hollow self. Sensory details (ozone, crimson walls) selective via dimensional awareness. Setting evolves causally with storm, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape eternal loop) signaled early, tightens causally via Lira's reveal narrowing options to "let go together." Agency in pressing fragments forecloses immortality path with felt fear cost. One reversal sufficient under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of boredom vs. unknown emerges organically via amulets feeding "loneliness," resonant in final smile amid void ("symphony of possibilities"). No moralizing; mirrors provide non-literal answer to goodbye's aftermath. Complexity in Kael's terror lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (dimensional senses tingling). Dialogue natural, goal-driven ("We can escape"), subtext-laden. Voice modulates rhythm with pressure, prose texture distinct in aurora hair, hushed thunder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax, high density integrates sensory/action. No loops; minor figurative density ("fractured rainbow") purposeful without muddle in peak shatter beat. Clean mechanics, propulsion peaks at "falling through."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortality curse via twin amulets and spatial mutiny transforms trope organically. Risky void ending inevitable from established boredom/loop, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
