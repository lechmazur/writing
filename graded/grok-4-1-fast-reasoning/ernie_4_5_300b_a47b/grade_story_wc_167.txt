<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength in embodied interiority via sensory details like "chill of the water, the warmth of the rising sun"; lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating the serene ritual, muting peak emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in notebook jotting ("The prism atrium... hold the light") and lighter steps, reweighting mundane with conceptual cost of fragility before "everything shifts."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pond, prism, and mist constrain ritual choices (tossing stone, tracing ripples) and charge final image as mist thins, revealing bay; glazier bias filters light/prism details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate mundane) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ripple patterns deepening insight; cost legible in endurance of cold/quiet seeking, charging notebook commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mundane's potential emerges implicitly from prism/ripples/particulars, resonating in final walk without moralizing; notebook line recharges prior images non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with glazier perceptual signature in light/refraction noticing; rhythmic modulation builds lyric pressure to closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyricism; minor paraphrase loops on "prism atrium" and mundane value do not obscure ripple-to-insight causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh glazier-ritual synthesis via pond patterns transforms dawn vignette; risk in quiet lyricism heightens stakes through fragile "before everything shifts" frame.</comment>
