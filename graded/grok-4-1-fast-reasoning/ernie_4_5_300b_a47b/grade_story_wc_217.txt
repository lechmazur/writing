<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and micro-choices under subtle pressure, like tracing the feather's barbs amid unraveling thoughts; motivation intensifies through tending despite imperfection. Minor lack of sharper contradictory impulses prevents 9+; endurance of transience feels earned but idealized without deeper flaw-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from kite snap catalyst to final CR in "woven dawns... would unravel by morning," with legible conceptual cost of impermanence. Single scene oriented early; micro-turn at snap pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration constrains choices—storm debris supplies weaving materials, lagoon ripples respond to song, charging final wade. Recurring lagoon/body (feet in water) mirrors internal harmony-seeking; fisherman nod adds subtle social texture without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via kite snap catalyzing weave into pulsing tapestry; agency in humming/tending forecloses rupture with transience cost felt in final image. Coherent pressure under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transient beauty emerges organically from debris-weaving to final feather-hold repricing impermanence without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "act of creation mattered more than its permanence." Subtext in fisherman nod adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature—poet filters debris as "map," song vibrations as harmony; rhythmic lyric voice modulates from pause to hush without slippage. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels accumulatively without loops or scaffolds; purposeful lyric figures like "silver veins" integrate without muddle. Minor simile density in weaving beat purposeful, not overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of poet harmonizing storm discord via drake feather transforms nature tropes; risk-taking in accumulative texture heightens stakes organically. Kite snap into transient beauty feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
