<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's guilt embodied via trembling watch and writhing chest compels shift from false memories to truth-telling, with contradictory impulses in his hesitation to betray client; earned renunciation forecloses lying path with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as driftwood visions accumulate density to pattern break (brother erased), yielding Conceptual Repricing closure—"sieved hush had to be broken"—with watch stopping as felt cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening via cedar sliver suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood constrains discovery and charges final image (sand shifting under truth's weight); cobalt terrace bookends with purposeful dusk evolution, sensory selection (salt air, gull cries) filters through Elias's guilt-biased perception without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover brother's truth to quell Lila) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via heart carving reversal narrowing options to truth-telling; agency in sifting yields visible cost (betrayal risk) charging ending under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of lies-vs-truth emerges organically from false memories clashing with ocean-preserved realities; final image reconfigures "sieved hush" with resonant ambiguity (mercy or betrayal), avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (guilt-tinged noticing of carvings); rhythmic prose modulates from poised terrace to frantic visions, diction purposeful without register drift or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm passes ear test; minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("salt and secrets... barnacles") risks muddle but weaves into action without obscuring closure or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist sifting driftwood truths transforms trope of buried secrets; risk-taking in ocean-memory premise heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via watch motif.</comment>
