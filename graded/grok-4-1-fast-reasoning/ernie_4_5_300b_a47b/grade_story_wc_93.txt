<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory visions (harmony vs. storm) act simultaneously in rock rearrangements, earning the final renunciation of control with embodied tears; interiority particular via curse-twisted fragments. Flawless under solo POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rock sequences build pattern density to CR closure ("The sacred patterns weren’t a puzzle to solve, but a language to honor") with legible emotional cost in tears/salt spray; single scene oriented early, one tightening via fraying visions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora constrains eel geometries and rock placements at water's edge, charging final sigil image; sensory hierarchy (visual fractals, tactile sand/clicks) POV-filtered through herder's priorities, evolves with aurora shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore patterns) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fracturing visions/rock trials forcing endurance; agency in Möbius reorder forecloses control path with terror cost, but stakes slightly abstract pre-final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (honor vs. solve patterns) emerges organically from rock/eel/star dust interplay, resonant CR in living sigil reweights promise without moralizing; no thematic echo, complexity in curse's knot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (pattern-obsessed noticing); rhythmic modulation peaks in short "The star dust screamed" under vision stress, diction controlled and voice-motivated lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "rocks clicked into place, their colors bleeding") propels without loops; figurative language patterned/legible (aurora as "liquid green"), zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms curse-trope via math rituals/frictionless eels into inevitable CR; bold accumulative lyricism heightens stakes organically, fresh synthesis of herder myth and probability dance.</comment>
