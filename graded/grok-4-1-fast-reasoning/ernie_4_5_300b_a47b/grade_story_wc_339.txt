<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in mother's loss, with embodied contradiction in trembling hands during analytic work; final renunciation of "release" for "transmission" earned by prior grief-causality, foreclosing tidy grief with felt bone-resonance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries (tape hum, frequency match) builds to on-page CR closure—"The physics of letting go wasn’t about release. It was about transmission"—repricing premise with conceptual cost in private vs. public work; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken library and snow globe as micro-settings constrain choices (salt-crusted books yield tape, globe reprise charges final image); sensory selection (rusted spools, lantern light) POV-biased and purposeful, mirroring internal decay without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, deepens via tape analysis to foreclose "release" option with realization-cost; under accumulative lens, one decisive cadence shift reweights knowledge without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transmission over release emerges organically from particulars (globe motor, Earhart hum), culminating in resonant CR final image that reweights premise without moralizing; lingering ambiguity in "ache of holding on" embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (analytic threading of decay/resonance); rhythmic modulation heightens quiet pressure, diction sophisticated yet embodied, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion via varied syntax accelerates to peak realization—"learning to shake the globe not to watch the storm, but to feel the resonance in her own bones"—rhythm charges closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum decay, Earhart transmission, and grief-globe transforms tropes; risk in lyric-accumulative realization heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from frequency pattern.</comment>
