<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and interior conflict (throat tightens at forgiveness graffiti; trembling hands at notebook) compel the final heart-map drawing with visible cost of surrender; minor diagnostic slips like "self-forgiveness" slightly abstract peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via graffiti discoveries building density to CR closure (heart-map realization reconfigures regrets as river with messy cost); orientation anchors early; no waivers needed as pattern pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy as green archive constrains discoveries (preserves graffiti, parts for drainpipe) and charges final image (leans closer, gilding in gold); sensory details (rust/damp, silt-murk) filter through Mara's river bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map regrets for healing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through deepening realizations (memory → forgiveness → current); agency in following arrows yields heart-map with felt cost of ongoing meander.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotional rivers emerges organically from graffiti particulars and final non-literal answer ("path is river... beyond the bend"); "Begin" graffiti reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (river chronicler notices currents/ripples); rhythmic prose modulates from raw edge to solace without drift or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion (e.g., graffiti-to-drainpipe chaining advances multiple layers); varied rhythm passes ear test; minor figurative density ("ivy clawed like thousand green fingers") in opener purposeful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti as collective emotional cartography transforms regret trope; accordion chronicler and station's liminal mosaic feel organic and memorable, risking lyric over plot.</comment>
