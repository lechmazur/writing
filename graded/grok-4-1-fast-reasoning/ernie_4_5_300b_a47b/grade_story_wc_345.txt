<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent for Elara, but lacks concrete interiority, embodied contradiction, or micro-choices under pressure; settlers reduced to faceless group with no status dynamics or individual flaws shown through action. No on-page pivotal choice forecloses a path with felt cost; mostly told traits like altruism undermine character-particular revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: messages accumulate density to mobilization, tightening to gathering with legible closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (nebula flares, arch holds) via collective image carrying felt effort cost. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices, no causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating arches and pearl-fruited groves vividly constrain stakes (crumbling threat), pearl-fruited trees and nebula integrate purposefully via POV-filtered selection mirroring hope; bell as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects ethereal urgency without checklist tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save arches/nebula) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via messages overcoming doubt to unified action; one tightening (mobilization) driven by Elara's agency narrows options with visible cost in effort and potential loss. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope emerges organically from messages-to-action arc and final bell chime repricing isolation; resonant without moralizing, though "hope was not a solitary pursuit" edges overt. Complexity lingers in unseen trust without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person voice with ethereal perceptual signature modulates rhythmically; minimal dialogue natural and goal-pursuing. Compression purposeful, no head-hopping; diction biased toward ghostly calm fits aims without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm passes ear test; minor overwriting in descriptive runs (e.g., nebula opener) and occasional paraphrase loops (message summaries) dull minor beats but spare closure. No filter stacks or template cadence in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost altruism, chalk messages, and crumbling arches transforms tropes via nebula-bell reprise; bold planetary premise commits without retreat, heightening stakes organically (+0.3 risk bonus). No derivative templates; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
