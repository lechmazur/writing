<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation roots clearly in her soul-collecting purpose, with embodied fear admission ("I fear that laughter is not enough") creating contradictory impulses that earn her final stance shift. Modestly fearless trait shown through unflinching advance into shadows. Minor slip in tidy epiphany ("She understood now"), but closure choice feels compelled by prior dialogue pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from pebble hums to harp dissonance, tightening to laughter realization. Orientation anchored early (Lira in Echo Gorge at sunrise). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with tooth pulsing and "luminous ache of hope," reweighting healing premise with emotional cost legible in lighter heart after fear admission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharp: sound-dominant (pebbles hum, harp keening) narrows under pursuit urgency, tactile cold on tooth. Setting guides via twisting path and pooling shadows. Recurring tooth constrains grip/offer and charges final pulse image, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrate laughter into healing) signaled early via dream, deepens accumulatively through spirit's probing ("What do you fear?") narrowing to truth admission. Agency in stepping closer/holding tooth forecloses doubt path. Cost felt in hesitation and post-exchange silence before hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of laughter-through-truth emerges organically from harp grief undercut by joy thread, resolving in non-literal final image of pulsing tooth and golden hope without moral state. Subtext in spirit's "Your presence here is a confession" layers complexity. No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward spectral sounds/textures ("pebbles that hummed with ghosts"). Voice texture poetic yet grounded, modulating rhythm in dialogue (whispers to lullaby). Natural subtextual exchange advances stakes without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density ("sky bled gold," "shadows pooled... thick as ink") borders overwrite in opening approach beats, slightly dulling propulsion (-0.4). No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs propel ("crunched," "plucking"). Closure image crisp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-collecting with laughter quest via harp spirit transforms ghost-story tropes through textured realization. Crocodile tooth as resilience symbol inflects uniquely. Bold lyric risk in accumulative poise heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
