<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like recalibrating conduits amid the shudder; embodied stoic wonder and restlessness mirror decay effectively. Minor label-speak in "functionally creative" repetition slightly undercuts particularity without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to projected equation as Charged Poise/CR; orientation anchored early in spaceport exploration. Closure cost legible in "raw, untested" hypothesis foreclosing perfection, shaped by decay constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via hidden conduits rerouted in atrium; vivid sensory hierarchy (echoed boots to alive hum) reflects engineer POV bias. Collapsed atrium/crater charges final equation image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repurposing tightens via hum/lights escalation under Accumulative lens, driven by agency in placing sextant and recalibrating. Cost felt in untested equation and resolve to return, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing broken systems emerges organically from flows/equation; final sunlight-pierced ruins reweights decay into possibility without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer via raw formula ties to restlessness arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with engineer-perceptual signature in "structural calculations" and "redirected flows"; rhythmic modulation builds to stoic softening. No elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (e.g., "wind through a forgotten city"). Minor overwriting in opening descriptions doesn't dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi relic in engineer-led repurposing transforms abandonment trope; sextant-pendant/equation inevitability from prior flows feels organic and risky.</comment>
