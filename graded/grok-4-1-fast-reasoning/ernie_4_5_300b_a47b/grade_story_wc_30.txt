<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Librarian's motivation to preserve wonder via smelting contradictions is embodied in gear shifts and trinket collection; woman's fear-loss tension acts simultaneously in hesitation-dive beat. Child's arc feels slightly underdeveloped despite mirroring. Final child smelting earns librarian's contentment with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images of tides, creel, transformations build density to Charged Poise closure in child's starfish dissolving, reweighting routine's eternity with conceptual cost of endless cycles. Orientation anchored by para 1; no debt. Single scene coherence perfect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atrium's brackish pools and creel constrain choices (dive, smelt), charging final image; sensory gears-as-waves integrate with action. Recurring bamboo glows evolve causally. Body/scale details (brass limbs tracing journal) mirror internal flux.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder preservation via contradictions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in woman's "routine is a cage" pushback-dive, child's echo affirming. Cost legible in skin-shedding fear and routine endurance. Minor: child beat slightly underpressured vs. woman's climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of migrating identities via contradictions emerges organically from smelting events; final "fish took flight" image non-literally answers routine-as-cage with resonant reconfiguration. No moralizing; ambiguity in eternal loop lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature (gears humming approval, quartz eyes brightening) biases toward tidal-wonder lens; dialogue subtextual ("Fear is a tide") pursues goals. Rhythmic modulation under transformations; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propulsion: every line advances image/pressure without loops; varied rhythm (short plunge beat vs. humming close) reads aloud seamlessly. Figuratives purposeful (chestplate constellations aligning), no muddle in peaks. Zero scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Surreal premise synthesizes gears/tides/identities into inevitable loop; risk in moon-shifting librarian heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation of routine-cage trope via smelting feels fresh, hindsight-earned.</comment>
