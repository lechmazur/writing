<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choices under pressure, like tasting the ink despite danger and trading the scroll, reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in her father's lessons, earning her bold negotiation. Agents read as stock (greed/fear via ink vision), slightly undermining relational crucible. Closure renunciation of scroll feels motivated by prior internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via because/therefore links: overhearing agents → tasting ink → confronting with scroll → trading for asylum. Closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with legible cost in "traded the scroll for asylum papers," reconfiguring from hiding to safety. Orientation anchored early ("crouched behind a mahogany casket"); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prep room details (lilies/iron linen, casket) selectively constrain choices, like hiding spot and dummy reveal at "Open it." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's urgency (footsteps as metronome). Casket charges final image as breach point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect math/asylum) signaled early, tightens via ink-enabled insight narrowing agents' doubt into negotiation. Protagonist agency drives reversal at "Asylum first," with visible cost in scroll trade foreclosing secrecy. Pressure coheres causally without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of "mathematics of equity" emerges organically from ink math and fair trade demand, resonating in final line "make sure no one ever has to fake their death again" without moralizing. Ink color shifts reweight waiting as bold action. Complexity in con artist's "honest" child avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elara's perceptual signature (ink as "mood ring," thoughts "clear as fluorescent lights"). Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("Asylum first"), distinguishing child's directness from agents' menace. Rhythmic control modulates tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with lines like "ink pot’s liquid swirled violet" advancing plot/atmosphere; varied rhythm in peak ("guns drawn. Mr. Harrow paled."). Minor paraphrase loop on "waiting actively" but no closure touch or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con-kid, pseudo-chemical ink mind-reading, and "fair trade math" in funeral home transforms tropes organically. Risky child-negotiator with agents heightens stakes via ink's "clarity," inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
