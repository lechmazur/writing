<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in jealousy of past selves acting simultaneously with feral nostalgia's pull during the climb; embodied in "clawed at my ribs" and trembling hands. Final renunciation of hatred earned by scroll discoveries with felt cost of self-acceptance. Minor reflection excess but anchored to present cues like grave and ledge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scroll discoveries and realizations layer density to CR closure: "I wasn’t trapped... I was building it," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of ongoing messiness. Orientation anchored early (cabin, grave by para 2). No shard excess; single tightening via blank scroll suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity (snow crunch, pine resin, slick ice) reflects urgency, narrowing during climb; fissure and pedestal constrain squeeze and ritual. Moonlight shaft charges final image, mirroring internal clarity. Lived-in navigation (half-buried headstone, floorboard) avoids generics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (resolve feral nostalgia) signaled early, accumulates via scrolls to deepening realization narrowing escape illusion. Agency in climbing despite limp and placing scroll forecloses past-jealousy path with visible cost in arduous steps. One tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-as-builder emerges organically from grave/scrolls/ledge arc; final image non-literally answers chaos-narrative question by reweighting nostalgia as compass without moralizing. Subtext in jealousy fade invites ambiguity on past's clarity. Resonance from particulars like birch bark avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in jaded phrasing ("sick joke the universe played"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in climb, compresses at peak realization. Stable first-person with POV-biased noticing (memories as "jumbled tapestry"). No dialogue; elision of flight accident cued early, paid in limp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short climb gasps vs. flowing reflections); density high, lines multi-job (e.g., "dusk painting sky in bruised purples" advances time/atmosphere). Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("feral nostalgia clawed," "green-eyed monster") in mid-beats slightly dulls propulsion but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grave-as-joke, self-writing scrolls transforms memory tropes via chronicler frame; risk in ritual ledge payoff heightens internal stakes. Inevitable hindsight from map X to blank scroll realization. No derivative echoes.</comment>
